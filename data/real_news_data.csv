If you’re cooking for someone with a nut allergy, it’s useful to know that whilst avoiding products that contain nuts may seem straightforward, some foods that don’t contain nuts may have been produced in factories that handle them (chocolate and baked goods are common examples). As nut allergies can be triggered by the slightest trace of nut, awareness of these risks is important – luckily products manufactured in such conditions are well-labelled. If someone has a nut allergy, check carefully before making dishes that could carry a risk of containing nut traces, such as chocolate desserts, and check the labels of all the ingredients you use before preparing the meal.

Some ingredients can cause confusion as to whether they are classed as a nut. The coconut falls into the grey area of whether it’s a fruit, nut or seed – it has the qualities of all three – however, it is classified as a dry drupe (other examples of drupes are peaches and plums) and the brown, fibrous coconuts seen in shops is its seed. Pine nuts are actually seeds, so may be safe for some individuals with a nut allergy. Some people are allergic to these foods without being allergic to other substances, and individuals with nut allergies may also suffer from additional allergies to coconuts or pine nuts. If you’re allergic to tree nuts, it’s best to exercise caution with these foods and consult your doctor.

Nutmeg is the kernel of an apricot-like fruit. There is no hard evidence to suggest that people with nut allergy are particularly at risk from nutmeg, and the incidence of nutmeg allergy is thought to be rare. However, those who are sensitive to almonds and other fruit kernels should exercise caution.",Nut-free recipes and information,http://www.bbc.co.uk,[],http://static.bbci.co.uk/food/1.37.152/assets/img/food_placeholder.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/diets/nut_free
1,"Lamb in Britain is called lamb if it’s marketed in the year of its birth (or in the year following its birth if the lamb is born after 30 September). After this it becomes known as hogget or old-season lamb. Only when the animal has its first permanent incisor tooth (at around 1-1½ years) will the meat from it become known as mutton. However, the majority of mutton comes from breeding animals that have reached the end of their productive contribution to the flock. Although early-season lamb is very tender, the meat from older animals will have developed more flavour.

Buyer's guide When buying lamb, choose the leanest cuts with firm, creamy-white fat (although fat colour alone should not be used as a reliable indicator of quality). Avoid cuts with excessive fat or with fat that looks crumbly, brittle and yellowish: this means the meat is old. The colour and flavour of the flesh will vary depending on where the sheep were raised. Look for pale-pink flesh in a very young lamb, to a light- or dark-red colour in an older animal. A good butcher is likely to stock a greater variety of cuts than your local supermarket, or you'll be able to order exactly what you want. Rare breed lamb is farmed non-intensively. The meat is dark, closely textured and lean, and tastes like a cross between lamb and venison. You can buy named, pure-bred, rare breeds from speciality butchers, over the internet using specialist meat mail-order companies, or from farmers' markets. Rare-breed meat costs a little more than commercial lamb, but the difference in flavour will be noticeable. Rare breeds include: Boreray, Castlemilk Moorit, Hebridean, Manx Loghtan, North Ronaldsay, Soay, Balwen Welsh Mountain, Cotswold, Devon and Cornwall Longwool, Dorset Down, Dorset Horn, Greyface Dartmoor, Hill Radnor, Leicester Longwool, Lincoln Longwool, Llanwenog, Norfolk Horn, Oxford Down, Portland, Ryeland, Shropshire, Southdown, Teeswater, Wensleydale, Whitefaced Woodland, Whiteface Dartmoor.

Storage Ensure that the fridge maintains a temperature below 4°C (inexpensive thermometers can be bought for this purpose). Always store meat in the coldest part - the bottom shelf - of the fridge. If the meat is in a cling-filmed tray, leave it in the packaging until ready for use. If not, transfer the meat to a plate, wrap loosely in greaseproof paper or aluminium foil, and store in the fridge away from cooked meats and other ready-to-eat foods. In general, mince, offal and small cuts of lamb are best eaten on the day you buy them or within one to two days. Joints, chops and steaks will keep for two to three days and large roasting joints up to five days. Leaner cuts last longer than fatty cuts because fat goes rancid before meat does. Quickly freezing lamb reduces the chance of damage to the texture or succulence of the meat. Both smaller pieces and large joints of lamb can be frozen. For ease of use, freeze cuts tightly wrapped in individual portions. Don't freeze lamb for more than six months. When ready to use, defrost, loosely wrapped, in the fridge, allowing five hours per 450g/1lb.

Preparation Large cuts of lamb are often covered in a white papery membrane that should be removed before cooking. Lamb works well with a range of flavours beyond the traditional mint sauce. Generally, the intense flavour of autumn lamb is a good match for equally strong seasonings and aromatics. Try rubbing it with spices such as cumin before roasting, or piercing the skin several times and inserting sprigs of rosemary and pieces of anchovy into it. Marinades also work wonders on lamb, helping enhance its flavour and making it meltingly tender. Any cut of lamb can be braised or pot-roasted, and this method also works equally well for mutton. Stewed and braised lamb should be cooked gently in a liquid such as wine, stock or tomato juice. This method guarantees that the meat will stay moist and tender, and the cooking liquid can be served as gravy.

Dementia affects everyone in different ways.

Dementia sufferers often struggle to remember recent events, follow conversations or find the right word for something.

They may forget names, repeat themselves, and can become confused about date and time. For example, they may wake in the middle of the night and get dressed, ready for the next day.

As dementia progresses, the person's behaviour may change, in a way that seems unusual or out of character. They may start asking questions repetitively, pacing, and having changes in appetite or disturbed sleep patterns.

In later stages, the person may have physical symptoms including weight loss and muscle weakness.

Life for dementia carers Over 40% of the UK population know a close friend or family member with dementia, and although a third of people with dementia live in a care home, that leaves two thirds being cared for independently.

The next time you talk to someone at work who's wearing a name badge, look at it very closely - it might not actually be a badge at all, but a sensor. It might be telling your employer who you're talking to and in what sort of tone of voice, writes Lucy Kellaway.

This isn't a brave new world; this is now.

Such devices are dirt cheap and companies are increasingly taking note. It's pretty scary. Yet is the arrival of Big Brother in the corporate world quite such a bad thing?

Being constantly monitored by invisible devices might sound terrifying but I'm not sure it is any more so than being monitored infrequently by visible human beings.

Under the present arrangement, we are observed in a haphazard and unscientific way by superiors who may well have made their minds up about us already, based on not much evidence at all.

Such surveillance did not improve my behaviour, though it did increase my sense of injustice. To have been monitored all the time - which would have put the shopping list in the context of otherwise diligent behaviour - would have been a vast improvement.

In most offices a raft of mainly pointless, cumbersome tools are used to assess performance, including ""competency matrices"", appraisal interviews and psychometric testing. Together they are so ineffective that according to a delightful piece of research by the University of Catania, companies would be no worse off if they promoted people at random.

So if we are in favour of meritocracies, we should also be in favour of anything that helps us measure merit more accurately.

While the data collected by the new sensors are almost certainly too crude to offer much help now, I see no reason why in time (and probably quite soon) we will not have worked out exactly which behavioural quirks are the key to high (or low) performance, and found a decent, objective way of measuring them.

You could say that monitoring behaviour in offices would kill trust and spontaneity, making robots of us all.

But so long as everyone knew they were being monitored and understood what for, I don't see why it should be such a terrifying idea - except perhaps for those who bully, shout at or harass others and who have until now been getting away with it.

Far from making work less civilised, the arrival of Big Brother could make it more so. Office life could become more transparent and less political. And managers would be freed from having to play the role of policeman all day and allowed to get on with the more important role of helping people do a better job.

Above all, for the system to work, you would need to have some faith in the regime that implemented it. But then, if you don't have any faith in the regime, the chances are that you are done for anyway.

Scientists say they have devised a helmet that can quickly determine whether a patient has had a stroke.

It could speed diagnosis and treatment of stroke to boost chances of recovery, the scientists say.

The wearable cap bounces microwaves off the brain to determine whether there has been a bleed or clot deep inside.

The Swedish scientists who made the device plan to give it to ambulance crews to test after successful results in early studies with 45 patients.

Race against time

Image copyright SIMON FRASER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption A weak blood vessel can rupture and cause a haemorrhagic stroke

When a person has a stroke, doctors must work quickly to limit any brain damage.

If it takes more than four hours to get to hospital and start treatment, parts of their brain tissue may already be dying.

Time lost is brain lost Dr Shamim Quadir, Stroke Association

But to give the best treatment, doctors first need to find out if the stroke is caused by a leaky blood vessel or one blocked by a clot.

A computerised tomography (CT) scan will show this, but it can take some time to organise one for a patient, even if they have been admitted as an emergency to a hospital that has one of these scanners.

Any delay in this ""golden hour"" of treatment opportunity could hamper recovery.

Vital window

To speed up the process, researchers in Sweden, from Chalmers University of Technology, Sahlgrenska Academy and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, have come up with a mobile device that could be used on the way to hospital.

The helmet uses microwave signals - the same as the ones emitted by microwave ovens and mobile phones but much weaker - to build a picture of what is going on throughout the brain.

Tests with an early prototype - a refashioned bicycle helmet - found it could accurately distinguish between bleeds (haemorrhagic stroke) and clots (ischaemic stroke), although not 100% of the time.

They have since built and tested a custom-made helmet to better fits skulls of different shapes and sizes, and they have tested it out with the help of nurses and patients at a local hospital ward.

Ultimately, they want to fit it into the pillow the patient rests their head on.

The researchers say their device needs more testing, but could be a useful aid in the future.

Doctors would probably still need to use other diagnostic methods too, they told Transactions on Biomedical Engineering journal.

Investigator Prof Mikael Persson said: ""The possibility to rule out bleeding already in the ambulance is a major achievement that will be of great benefit in acute stroke care.""

Plans to create two huge marine sanctuaries in Antarctica have failed for a third time, after Russia again headed nations which blocked the bids.

The meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Australia had sought to protect the Ross Sea and an area off East Antarctica from exploitation.

But delegates from 24 countries, plus the EU, failed to reach a consensus.

Environmental groups called it called it a ""dark day"" for the Antarctic.

The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is made up of countries with an interest in Antarctica.

The continent and its waters are home to more than 10,000 species, including most of the world's seabirds, penguins and whales.

CCAMLR includes Australia, the US, China and Russia, and the European Union among its members. Any decisions taken require consensus among all parties.

Plans for a marine reserve in the Ross Sea - a deep bay on the Pacific Ocean side of the Antarctic - have been under discussion for a decade, and have been blocked on several previous occasions, with the main sticking point restrictions on fishing.

CCAMLR has established just one Marine Protected Area in the Antarctic so far.

They have designated 11 priority areas in the Southern Ocean from which most MPAs will be created.

Governments have set a goal of extending protected areas to ten percent of the world's oceans

According to the environmental advocacy group, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, the Ross Sea comprises 3.3% of the area of the Southern Ocean, but ""it provides habitat for significant populations of many animals, including 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 26% of Emperor penguins, more than 30% of Antarctic petrels, 6% of Antarctic minke whales, and perhaps more than 30% of 'Ross Sea' killer whales"".

Hope for agreement

""Moreover, it has the richest diversity of fishes in the high latitude Southern Ocean, including seven species found nowhere else.""

A revised proposal by the US and New Zealand - reducing the scale of the Ross Sea reserve by 40% to about 1.25m sq km (482,000 sq miles) - had been thought more likely to succeed at the Commission's meeting in Hobart.

Also on the table in Hobart was a proposal to create a protected zone of 1.6m sq km (618,000 sq miles) off East Antarctica.

Image caption The Antarctic Ocean Alliance, which rallied outside the CCAMLR meeting in Hobart, said ""countries led by Russia wanted to wreck the agreement""

The two zones were intended to conserve parts of the Southern Ocean from fishing, oil exploration and other commercial exploitation.

But they were both blocked by Russia and Ukraine, while China withdrew support for the East Antarctica proposal.

""It seems pretty clear that a small group of countries led by Russia wanted to wreck the agreement,"" said Steve Campbell, director of the Antarctic Ocean Alliance which campaigns for protecting the Antarctic seas.

Andrea Kavanagh, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' Southern Ocean sanctuaries project, also expressed dismay at the outcome:

""This is a dark day not just for the Antarctic, but for the world's oceans,"" she said.

""Protecting the Southern Ocean has far-reaching consequences for the world's oceans and all those who rely on them for food, jobs, and a multitude of other services.

""Three-quarters of all marine life is maintained by a Southern Ocean current that pulls nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean to the surface and then around the world.

There was no immediate statement from Russia.

26,"Image caption Corals all over the world are threatened by rising rates of acidification in the oceans

The world's oceans are becoming acidic at an ""unprecedented rate"" and may be souring more rapidly than at any time in the past 300 million years.

In their strongest statement yet on the issue, scientists say acidification could increase by 170% by 2100.

The report's co-author said acidification had already caused a 30% loss of species in some ocean ecosystems.

The researchers conclude that human emissions of CO2 are clearly to blame.

The study will be presented at global climate talks in Poland next week.

In 2012, over 500 of the world's leading experts on ocean acidification gathered in California. Led by the International Biosphere-Geosphere Programme, a review of the state of the science has now been published.

You don't find a mollusc at the ph level expected for 2100, this is really quite a stunning fact Prof Jean-Pierre Gattuso, CNRS

This Summary for Policymakers states with ""very high confidence"" that increasing acidification is caused by human activities which are adding 24 million tonnes of CO2 to oceans every day.

Pickled waters

The addition of so much carbon has altered the chemistry of the waters.

Since the start of the industrial revolution, the waters have become 26% more acidic.

""This is the state of the art,"" said Prof Jean-Pierre Gattuso, from CNRS, the French national research agency.

""My colleagues have not found in the geological record, rates of change that are faster than the ones we see today.""

What worries the scientists is the potential impact on many ocean species including corals.

Studies carried out at deep sea vents, where the waters are naturally acidic thanks to CO2, show a 30% loss of biodiversity.

These vents may be a ""window on the future"" according to the researchers.

ACIDIFYING OCEANS The oceans are thought to have absorbed up to half of the extra CO2 put into the atmosphere in the industrial age

This has lowered their pH by 0.1

pH is the measure of acidity and alkalinity

It usually ranges from pH 0 (very acidic) to pH 14 (very alkaline); 7 is neutral

Seawater is mildly alkaline with a ""natural"" pH of about 8.2

""You don't find a mollusc at the pH level expected for 2100, this is really quite a stunning fact,"" said Prof Gattuso.

""It's an imperfect window, only the ocean's acidity is increasing at these sites, they don't reflect the warming we will see this century.

""If you combine the two, it could be even more dramatic than what we see at CO2 vents.""

The effect of acidity is currently being felt most profoundly felt in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. These chilly waters hold more CO2 and increasing levels of the gas are turning them acidic more rapidly than the rest of the world.

The more acidic they become, the more damaging they are to the shells and skeletons of marine organisms.

The researchers say that by 2020, ten percent of the Arctic will be inhospitable to species that build their shells from calcium carbonate. By 2100 the entire Arctic will be a hostile environment.

Image caption Pteropods like this are already feeling the corrosive impact of acidic waters in the Antarctic

These effects are already visible says Prof Gattuso.

""In the Southern Ocean, we already see corrosion of pteropods which are like sea snails, in the ocean we see corrosion of the shell.

""They are a key component in the food chain, they are eaten by fish, birds and whales, so if one element is going then there is a cascading impact on the whole food chain.""

The authors warn that the economic impact of the losses from aquaculture could be huge - the global cost of the decline in molluscs could be $130bn by 2100 if emissions of CO2 continue on their current pathway.

Adding alkaline substances such as crushed limestone to the waters has been mooted as a potential way of mitigating the worst impacts of acidification. But Prof Gattuso says it would only have a limited effect.

""Maybe in bays which have a restricted exchange with open oceans it may work, it may give some local relief.

""But the latest research is showing that it is not really practical at a global scale. It is very expensive and very energy intensive.""

Marine protection zones would also give some short term benefit, but the scientists say that in the long term only significant cuts in emissions will slow the progress of acidification.

29,"Image copyright Other Image caption Gaia uses a 10.5m disc to shield its dual-telescope mechanism from the light and heat of the Sun

The orbiting Gaia telescope will lose some performance because stray light is getting inside the observatory, the European Space Agency (Esa) says.

But the impacts are likely to be very small, scientists believe, and the expectation is that all the mission's chief objectives will still be met.

Most of the unwanted light appears to be creeping around the giant shield Gaia uses to shade itself from the Sun.

The ""pollution"" makes it harder for the observatory to see the faintest stars.

""I must say this is not a major problem,"" said Esa's Gaia project manager, Giuseppe Sarri.

""The point is the spacecraft is doing very well in terms of everything is working, and now we're focussing on the things we want to improve.

""We were expecting to get some stray light but the fact is, it is larger than we predicted,"" he told BBC News.

Gaia was sent into orbit in December to do astrometry on a billion stars - to map their precise positions, distances and motions.

Telescope tent

This huge sample should provide the first true picture of our Milky Way Galaxy's structure.

As is normal after launch, the observatory was immediately put through a period of complex systems check-out and instrument calibration.

Engineers noticed early on that unexpected light was getting inside the big tent covering the satellite's dual telescope mechanism.

Modelling indicates most of it is sunlight being diffracted around the observatory's 10.5m-wide sunshield.

But further analysis suggests there is likely also some additional component - probably the general diffuse light on the sky itself.

Gaia - The discovery machine

Gaia will make a very precise 3D map of our Milky Way Galaxy

It is the successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped some 100,000 stars

The one billion to be catalogued by Gaia is still only 1% of the Milky Way's total

But the survey's quality promises a raft of discoveries beyond just the star map

It will find new asteroids and planets; It will test physical constants and theories

Gaia's sky map will be the reference to guide future telescopes' observations

The effect is certainly a nuisance because it makes it more difficult for Gaia to discern the least bright objects.

It was the mission's aim to measure the positions of all stars down to magnitude 20 (about 400,000 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye).

The stray light means about 40% of the accuracy of those measurements at this lowest magnitude will be lost.

Backwards and forwards

On the upside, it should be possible to get some of the performance back if Esa agrees to extend the mission and additional data can be taken.

And it is true to say that most of Gaia's science will be done at magnitude 15 (4,000 times fainter than the naked eye limit) and brighter, which is unaffected.

Where the pollution issue may be felt more keenly is in determining the motions of stars towards or away (radial velocity) from the satellite.

This information will have a number of applications but will be used to help make a 3D movie of the galaxy - to run forwards to see what happens millions of years into the future, and backwards to reveal how the galaxy was assembled in the deep past.

Gaia was hoping to get radial velocity data for about 150 million of the brightest stars.

It involves taking the light from a star and spreading it out into its component colours for analysis. For the faintest objects in the targeted sub-set of stars, this process again becomes much harder with stray light.

There's no reason to believe Gaia won't be a triumph Prof Gerry Gilmore, Cambridge University

The Gaia team thinks with some smart techniques it can recover some of the performance loss, but as it stands the mission may get radial velocity measurements now on only about 100 million stars.

""We say only about 100 million stars - that's still pretty spectacular,"" said Prof Gerry Gilmore, a Gaia scientist from the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University, UK.

""We don't actually know how many stars there are in the sky at the magnitudes needed to do the radial velocity measurements,"" he added.

""We had a guess that it was 150 million but that could be wrong by a factor of two; so it's quite possible there are a lot more stars out there [we can still measure].

""Gaia is the first ever high spatial resolution survey and so until Gaia has scanned the sky we won't know what's on the sky.""

Image copyright ASTRIUM Image caption Large sections of Gaia's telescope mechanism were constructed out of silicon carbide

Engineers are also tracking an issue with what they call the ""basic angle"".

Part of Gaia's measurement strategy requires it to look at two parts of the sky at the same time to lock a frame of reference.

This is why it carries two telescopes held rigidly at an offset angle of 106.5 degrees. Great effort was put into making sure this basic angle was absolutely stable, with many components being constructed out of stiff silicon carbide as a consequence.

Exploring our galaxy Image copyright Getty Images How do telescopes let us see so far into space?

But a vanishingly small flexure is being detected - fractionally beyond what had been anticipated.

The team believes, though, it can nullify any impacts if the behaviour can be properly characterised.

""It's all nuisance stuff. Depending how you count it, there are about 500 critical components on Gaia and they're all working fine,"" said Prof Gilmore.

""Yes, it's complicated; yes, there are things we don't fully understand yet; but there's no reason to believe Gaia won't be a triumph.""

Mr Sarri added that after the long commissioning process, the telescope was now ready to gather data continuously.

""In the last week, we had an informal handover and it's been working already in science mode on occasions. But now we will move into a period of 28 days of uninterrupted operation,"" he told BBC News.

30,"Image copyright Imperial Image caption Prof Tom Kibble's work led to the discovery of the Higgs boson but he was overlooked for a Nobel Prize

A scientist who predicted the Higgs boson - and another who helped to find it - have been knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list.

Prof Tom Kibble of Imperial College London was one of six researchers whose work in the 1960s led to the eventual discovery of the Higgs.

The elusive particle was finally detected in 2012 at Cern by two giant experiments - Atlas and CMS.

CMS was designed by Prof Tejinder Jim Virdee, also of Imperial.

The work we do at Cern really started in the 1960s with the seminal papers authored by Tom Kibble Prof Tejinder Jim Virdee, Imperial College London

He originated the concept of CMS in 1990 with four colleagues, oversaw its construction, and acted as spokesman for the experiment when it first began taking data in 2006-10.

Prof Virdee developed new technologies within the detector that ultimately allowed it to find the Higgs - the mechanism which explains how sub-atomic particles came to have substance, or mass.

'Over the Moon'

Both he and Prof Kibble become knights. They are joined by other distinguished scientists including Prof John Bernard Pethica of the National Physical Laboratory, and Prof Colin Blakemore of the University of London, former head of the Medical Research Council.

Prof Jessica Corner, dean of health sciences at the University of Southampton, is made a dame.

Image copyright Imperial Image caption Prof Virdee is one of the ""founding fathers"" of the CMS detector which found the Higgs boson

The timing of Prof Kibble's award is particularly poignant - after he was controversially overlooked for the Nobel Prize in Physics last year.

The Nobel Committee chose to honour Peter Higgs and Francois Englert, but not the other three living physicists who first developed the theory - Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen and Tom Kibble.

Peter Higgs himself said that Kibble was ""the obvious candidate"" to be the third scientist honoured by the Nobel Committee, whose rules permit no more than three recipients per gong.

""I really rather hoped before the announcement that they would make the number up to three,"" Prof Higgs told BBC News.

""Not only did [Kibble] publish the last of the papers in 1964, he also wrote a longer paper that was really very important in generalising the sort of thing I had written in '64.""

Among the first to pay tribute to Prof Kibble's honour was his fellow knight and Imperial colleague Prof Virdee.

""Brilliant. I was hoping Tom would be recognised. I'm very, very happy for him, and I'm sure we'll have a glass of champagne when next we meet,"" he told BBC News.

""The work we do at Cern really started in the 1960s with the seminal papers authored by Tom Kibble.

""It has taken a very long time [to prove them] and it's great to have recognition for the experiment [CMS], as well as the theory.

""It wasn't clear we could actually build CMS when we first envisaged it. We had to invent new technologies to do the things we wanted to do.

""Thousands of scientists and engineers have worked on CMS and it was their painstaking efforts creating this experiment that made these discoveries possible.

""The Higgs is a very special type of particle - one we've never seen before. It has strange properties that we need to understand.

""This award was a complete surprise to me. It's really quite humbling and of course I'm delighted to receive it. I'm over the Moon to be frank.""

Distinguished figures in science and technology make up about 3% of this year's Birthday Honours list.

31,"Image caption The FSA says the new rules prevent bacteria being spread

More diseased meat could end up in sausages and pies because of changes to safety checks in slaughterhouses, hygiene inspectors have warned.

Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease.

But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone.

The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread.

Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK.

Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected.

Find out more Image caption Experts are divided about whether physical or visual inspections are better Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer

Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: ""Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now.

""There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.""

Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods.

The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA.

The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern.

He said: ""The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control.

""We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.""

But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses.

Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes.

Image caption Some in the meat industry say the rules will lead to a two-tier system

Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork.

He sees the new hands-off approach as ""a backward step"" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do.

But he says: ""Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product? We'll end up with a two-tier system.""

Shadow food and farming minister Huw Irranca-Davies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA.

He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britain's exports, which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards.

Mr Irranca-Davies said: ""We want to see absolute categoric assurances that this is not jeopardising consumer protection and we're not reassured yet because despite the work that the FSA has been doing over a few years now to look at this issue, what they have presented to us is not a compelling case for a change in the way that this works.""

A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman said: ""The changes to the meat inspections will mean less cutting and handling of carcasses and offal, reducing the potential risk of harmful bacteria spreading onto the meat.

32,"Image copyright NERC Image caption As the sea ice melts, ponds of water collect on top of the floes

A UK team believes it can now make skilful predictions of how much sea ice will melt during Arctic summers.

The scientists say the amount of water ponding on top of the floes as they warm in the spring has been shown to be an excellent indicator.

Using their technique, the Reading University researchers reckon the minimum ice extent this September will be about 5.4 million square km.

It is about the same as at the end of the melt season last year.

The floes in the far north are the subject of intense study currently because of their rapid summer decline.

Their extent has diminished from about 7 million square km in the 1990s to less than 5 million square km in five of the past seven years, with a record minimum of 3.6 million square km being set in 2012.

But the year-to-year variation is large and the computer models in general have failed to capture the behaviour.

Dark cover

""The sort of three-month prediction we're making would be useful for people who need to do operations in the Arctic, such as shipping companies for navigation purposes,"" explained Prof Daniel Feltham, who leads the NERC Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling team at Reading.

""But the physics we're introducing will also, hopefully, help improve the climate models that look longer term,"" he told BBC News.

Image copyright SPL Image caption The current rate of decline in September sea-ice cover is running at about 13% per decade

Prof Feltham and colleagues have found a strong correlation between the fraction of the floes covered by pond water in May and the eventual sea-ice extent seen in September.

The physical link is the change in reflectiveness, or albedo, brought about by the standing water.

The ponds are darker than bare ice and therefore absorb more of the Sun's energy, promoting further melting.

Prof Feltham's team has developed a model to forecast the evolution of melt ponds in the Arctic and has incorporated this into more general climate sea-ice models.

Satellite records show that the year with smallest pond fraction in late spring (11% in 1996) had the biggest sea ice extent in September; and the year with the largest pond fraction (34% in 2012) featured the all-time low extent come the autumn.

The team published its ideas in a recent edition of the journal Nature Climate Change.

Southern differences

Now, it has put out its first open forecast for this September of 5.4 million square km, give or take half a million.

It compares with 5.35 million square km averaged across September last year.

""What could knock our prediction off course? Weather conditions, certainly. If we have anomalously cold conditions, we would expect the ice extent to be higher; or if we had very stormy conditions, like they did in August 2012 - that could diverge the ice and encourage more melting,"" he said.

In contrast to the Arctic, the Antarctic is currently showing an alternative trend, with the winter maximum extent growing to record levels.

How useful the Reading technique would be in predicting the region's summer minimums is uncertain.

The factors that control the floes in the south are different to those in the north, and already they diminish to very low extents by autumn as a matter of course anyway.

A New Zealand-led team recently demonstrated that the choppiness of Southern Ocean water could have a moderating impact on the growth of sea ice around Antarctica.

The Reading number has been submitted to Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) Sea Ice Prediction Network. This has become a kind of annual academic ""competition"" run between scientists who study the Arctic to see whose forecast most closely matches the eventual outcome.

36,"The hybrid racer’s carbon-fibre tub and front end were subjected to an eye-opening dexterity test in May, in anticipation of the ZEOD RC’s debut at the Le Mans 24 Hours. The car, an evolution of the DeltaWing project that was forced to retire from Le Mans in 2012 after making debilitating contact with a concrete barrier, will comprise the innovation-centric “Garage 56” entry on the starting grid.

Nissan said the racing car has cleared all safety regulations put forward by the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), the race series’ governing body. And as the video above amply demonstrates, forward collisions at speed play out in dramatic fashion, with the carbon fibre absorbing all of the released kinetic energy. But unlike a front member fashioned from aluminium or steel, the pricey material turns to dust.

The ZEOD RC is powered by an electric motor and battery powertrain derived from the Leaf electric hatchback. It also packs a 1.5-litre three-cylinder gasoline engine good for 400 horsepower, which takes over after its electric power is drained (and which can apparently fit inside a suitcase).

The ZEOD RC underwent testing at La Sarthe – as the Le Mans circuit is called – on 1 June, where it ran alongside entries from the elite LMP1 category. Indeed, the DeltaWing strung together class-competitive laps in 2012, and the ZEOD RC retains much of that car’s spirit, from its tiny front axle to its Batmobile-like form.

The 82nd running of the world’s premier endurance race takes place 14-15 June.

37,"Ever since BBC Autos’ recent muddy mingle with Land Rover in Kentucky, a palpable craving for off-road adventure has coursed through our ranks. Vicarious thrills have had to do, but as this video from American Expedition Vehicles (AEV) demonstrates, the thrills can still be quite visceral.

This production comes from Iceland, a place that is – as we’ve learned – tailor-made for off-tarmac adventuring. With a population of less than 300,000 and a bounty of craggy landscapes and slippery surfaces, Iceland is prime country for an off-road tuning company like AEV. The Michigan-based modifiers of all things Jeep Wrangler took a pair of their JK350 Wranglers on the expedition through Iceland’s deep ravines, vast rivers and gritty sands.

This isn’t your average slushy drive to the grocery. AEV’s purpose-built rigs have lifted suspensions and knobby off-road tires designed specifically to handle this type of pockmarked landscape without hesitation.

38,"This new (old) Mini joins Lego's challenging Creator series of kits - many of which, by virtue of parts that number in the thousands, are recommended for ""children"" ages 16 and up. The Mini's box contains a hefty 1,077 pieces (a daunting count to a novice, but a trifle to enthusiasts who survived Lego's 4,295-piece Tower Bridge kit, or 5,195-piece Millennium Falcon kit).

The British racing green Cooper's doors, white-striped hood and trunk open, and the roof pulls off to reveal a nattily trimmed interior, complete with patterned seats and a veneer-style dashboard. Beneath the bonnet, there's a Lego-ized version of Mini's 1.3-litre engine, complete with twin air cleaners for the dual SU side-draft carburetors. At the rear, the boot lid opens to reveal a blanket, a picnic basket and a bottle.

The Lego Mini Cooper debuts on 1 Aug, priced at $99.99 in the US, $119.99 in Canada, $149.99 in Australia and £74.99 in the UK. Check out Lego's video tour of the car below.

39,"A bit of context: The Z06 was officially unveiled at the Detroit Motor Show earlier this year, with Chevy announcing only that it would have ""at least"" 625bhp.

But today's news that said ""at least"" meant ""25hp more than"" confirms the new Z06 as the most powerful production Corvette to date – and, in fact, the most powerful production car General Motors has ever built.

That 650bhp is matched by a monster 650 pound-feet of torque, too – 457lb-ft of which is produced just off idle. Imagine the traffic-light burnouts. Chevrolet references the Ferrari F12, saying that while the Ferrari offers more horsepower, the Chevy offers more torque.

""Torque is the pulling power of an engine,"" explains Jordan Lee, Chevy's small block chief engineer, ""and the LT4's abundance of it at every rpm in the engine's speed range helps the 2015 Corvette Z06 accelerate quicker and respond nearly instantaneously.""

Where have they found all that power? Stronger aluminium cylinder heads that can handle heat better than other aluminium heads, lightweight titanium intake valves, machined, forged steel connecting rods, forged aluminium pistons, a stainless steel exhaust manifolds and a dry sump. Sounds tasty.

The supercharger also spins to a mad 20,000rpm – 5,000rpm more than the outgoing Corvette ZR1 – with boost achieved more efficiently, we're told.

There's still no acceleration data, but if it doesn't eclipse the old Z06's 0-62mph time of 3.9s, we'll eat our cowboy hats.

And while the Z06 will unquestionably be very fast, it might just be very good to drive as well. Read what happened when Tom Ford tested the 'base' C7 Vette against Porsche's 911, and then imagine that car stuffed with another couple of hundred horsepower. Sheesh.

41,"American Honda’s headquarters sits just 20 miles south of the tar pits, but the company has exhibited signs of stickiness in recent years, unable to recover the sense of youthful spunk it once commanded.

Indeed, the more the company has struggled to recreate its earlier success, the worse its situation has become. For every shining success like the Accord sedan and CR-V crossover, there is a slow-selling disappointment, including the second-generation Insight and CR-Z, the Acura ZDX and RL from Honda’s Acura luxury subsidiary, and some less incriminating nameplates such as the Ridgeline and Crosstour – all of which have prompted former Honda fans to wonder what became of the company that once promised to “make it simple”.

To this, Honda answers with a redesigned Fit – marketed in Asia and Europe as the Jazz – a car armed with all the quantifiable improvements that attend a big global relaunch. There’s an 11% rise in horsepower (to 130), a 7.5% increase in torque (to 114 pound-feet), 14% greater range of ratios in the new continuously variable transmission (CVT) and a 16% uptick in fuel economy. These numbers are abetted by improvements to the flipping, flopping and folding Magic Seat, now 21.7% more magical than before. Hocus pocus aside, there is in fact more rear leg and cargo room when the ingenious seat is employed.

Kudos to Honda for its unrelenting focus on delivering safety, even in this, its entry-level model. The company expects the Fit to be named a Top Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), a nonprofit financed by the insurance industry, when that group smashes a new Fit into its test barricade. Additionally, the car has a rear back-up camera as standard – years ahead of US government legislation that mandates such equipment – a convex driver’s side auxiliary mirror and a passenger’s side blind spot camera to help reduce collisions.

The 2015 Fit scores 36mpg in EPA combined driving with the automatic CVT and 32mpg with the slick six-speed manual, numbers that move the car from near the bottom of the subcompact class to the top. The CVT’s 41mpg highway rating delivers the kind of efficiency that justifies choosing a smaller, rougher-riding subcompact over a bigger, more comfortable one in a way that the old car’s averages simply couldn’t.

As has been true of other recent Hondas, the CVT is fairly unobtrusive when the car is driven gently, even mimicking gear changes at times. Driven harder, though, and the engine drones as the CVT lets it rev eternally at the peak of its power band. The result is aurally displeasing, even if the computer says it is for the best.

Salvation is as simple as selecting Honda’s excellent six-speed manual transmission, with its light, quick throws and accuracy. So good is it that it reminds a driver of the fun that can be had even in a “budget” car.

Headlight illumination, a shortcoming in the previous Fit/Jazz, has been addressed, as the new car’s lights actually do their job on the low beam.

Honda boasts of improvements made to hush the usual small-car racket inside the Fit, with an array of sound-deadening mats applied throughout. The effort is successful, although the engine’s new direct fuel injection system, an inherently noisy technology, can give the impression of a farm tractor going about its chores in the distance.

Does this mean the Fit has powered free of Honda’s tar pit? For all the car’s many admirable and quantifiable virtues, it is frustrating and disappointing to find it let down by little faults that coalesce into a greater lament.

The relative quiet in the cabin serves to highlight the noisy ventilation fan, whose roar drowns out the music (and the engine) even at middle speed settings and not just at full blast.

The dashboard continues Honda’s current theme of mixing colours, shapes and materials in a seemingly random mélange that could be best summarised as cluttered. It is the same on the instrument panel, where a panoply of colours and designs vie for the driver’s attention.

Honda touts the car’s 7in infotainment display in the middle of the dash, but while it features iPad-like touch controls, the thing can be quite user-unfriendly, especially while driving. A finger swipe is not the most intuitive way to adjust volume, for example, or to toggle through radio stations. Drivers would do well to isolate such actions to the smart steering-wheel-mounted control buttons.

The system does provide good mobile device integration, with support for apps like Pandora in addition to iTunes music. When the Fit is parked, video can even be played through the HDMI cable. But these same features could have been included in a stereo with actual volume and tuning knobs a driver could easily operate while driving.

Outside, the Fit carries over its essential efficient shape, with some clear influence from the current Civic around the grille. The resulting car remains recognisably a Fit, but so similar to the original that its styling has to be considered stagnant, even in the test car’s resplendent Milano Red finish.

On balance, the Fit’s progress out of its tar pit is incremental. So many solid upgrades, undermined by less-than-intuitive infotainment controls and cluttered interior styling. This is unquestionably a better Fit, which immediately makes it one of the best subcompact hatchbacks on the market. It’s not enough to redeem an entire brand, but it is a confident step out of the oozy morass.

42,"He has flown to Vancouver, Canada, to meet Walter Wolf, an enigmatic Austrian-Canadian businessman who once campaigned a private Formula 1 racing team, and is thought to have largely bankrolled Lamborghini through the 1970s. Aono is guide and friend to Shin-jiro Fukada, owner of a very rare Lamborghini Countach that was especially built for Wolf, one incorporating aerodynamic and chassis improvements lifted right from the F1 racing cars of its day, and fitted with a hand-built 12-cylinder heart pounding out nearly 500 horsepower.

Fukuda, who speaks little English, slides over a picture of the Wolf Countach sitting in a garage as it undergoes restoration. There is a Ferrari F40 LM to the right, and in the background, what looks like a Vector W8. “Oh yes,” Aono laughs, “I sold that Vector to him!” He talks of his plans to increase the power of the Gumpert Apollo that replaced it, a clenched fist of a supercar capable of running down a Bugatti Veyron.

“Perhaps you've seen this?” Aono pulls out his smartphone and brings up a video. There, on a tiny screen, a Porsche 962C in Rothmans racing livery paces a Jaguar XJ220C – Le Mans racing machines on the empty early morning streets of Hiroshima, Japan.

Aono and his friends Takeshi Moroi and Senji Hoshino are all members of a fairly exclusive club. Not only do they own racing cars bred for the gruelling Le Mans 24 Hours – whose 82

nd

running comes 14-15 June – but they also drive them on the street. “Everyone calls us crazy, but I don't think so at all,” Aono muses in the video. “We own racing cars, so we may as well use them in our daily lives. It's only natural.” He takes a brief pause before finishing his thought: “I guess we are a little crazy.”

Aono’s Jaguar XJ220C is actually quite well-behaved for a purpose-built racing car. “The car was built to resist 24 hours of racing. That means a very tough car,” he says during his and Fukada’s Vancouver visit. Equipped with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre V6 engine, the racing version of Jaguar's iconic 1990s hypercar makes 550hp, and despite its age can still reach a top speed approaching 200mph. When launched in 1993, it was campaigned to victory over Porsche in the GT class, though the laurels were eventually snatched away by disqualification for running without catalytic converters.

On the street, Aono says the Jaguar requires “super concentration” of its driver. With no creature comforts, this most un-Jaguar-like of Jaguars is raw, loud, violent and extremely fast. “Just only a few pieces of equipment for battle,” he says. “So exciting.”

Moroi's Porsche 962C is even more powerful. Its air-cooled 2.9-litre turbocharged boxer engine makes 620hp – this, from a car weighing less than a Mazda Miata. “It even has air-conditioning, so it's actually quite comfy,” he says in the video. It may be a surprising sentiment to express about a racing car, but as Le Mans demands long, unbroken driving sessions, the cars are built with at least some thought towards driver wellbeing.

But where the Jaguar is relatively compliant, the prototype-class 962C is unhappy anywhere below 100kph thanks to its air-cooled nature. Regardless, Moroi drives the car frequently, squeezing its wide, spacecraft-shape body through Japan's narrow streets, and then unleashing the beast on the country's glass-smooth highways.

Senji Hoshino's 1989 Mazda 767B is wilder than either the Porsche or Jaguar, which is why it's perhaps best restricted to the track. It is powered by a 600hp four-rotor rotary engine, similar to the one that would give Mazda its historic win at the 1991 Le Mans in the successor car, the 787B. Mazda remains the only Japanese company to have won there.

Aside from relative durability and a smooth-revving nature, the most notable feature of a large-bore rotary engine is the incredible noise. Producing an ear-splitting shriek, Hoshino's 767B roasts its tires in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers, its orange and green racing livery a battle flag known throughout Japan.

On the morning of the video shoot, near the shattered dome of the Ground Zero monument in Hiroshima, a uniformed policeman – likely expecting to spend his day directing Toyota Crown taxis and supermini kei cars – stops making his rounds.

There, parked on the bridge used as a landmark to drop the first atomic bomb, are three racing cars released onto the street.

It's like coming across a trio of tigers on the sidewalk, fierce creatures out of their element, yet somehow perfectly assured of their place. For Aono, Moroi and Hoshima, their cars keep their serotonin at permanently elevated levels. “The most important thing,” says Aono in the video, “is to have fun in our everyday lives.”",For the love of Le Mans: Japan’s outlaw racers,http://www.bbc.com,[Brendan Mcaleer],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/20/s5/p020s5f7.jpg,2014-06-11 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20140611-outlaw-racers-of-japan

45,"Let’s start with the name. GTR was the tag McLaren attached to racing versions of the F1 road car. A car, let’s not forget, that won Le Mans back in 1995. The timing of this announcement, with the famous 24 hour race taking place this weekend – is surely no coincidence. At the moment, all McLaren is saying about the GTR is that this is a track-only version of the P1, but McLaren is fond of an anniversary – could it be possible that a P1 GTR will debut at Le Mans 20 years on from the F1’s famous victory?

Actual technical details are scant, as are images: we only have the underwhelming sketch below for now. McLaren claims it’s aiming for a 1,000PS output (986hp, a gain of 83hp over the current model) but doesn’t say if that’ll be from electrical enhancement or simply turning the wick up further on the twin turbo 3.8-litre V8. The aerodynamics will be enhanced to deliver more downforce, the track widths will be widened, the styling will be more aggressive and in place of the Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres, the GTR will feature ‘race-proven’ slicks.

This will make a big difference. The standard P1 is capable of pulling 2.15 lateral g and batting past 60mph and 100mph in 2.5sec and 5.0sec respectively. Just how much faster will the GTR be? Could 2.0sec to 60mph be possible? Sub-4.5sec to 100mph?

Here’s what we do know. It’s intended as a track day car for very wealthy clients. Production will only start once all 375 standard P1s have been built. Numbers will be very limited, and the GTR will cost £1.98 million (about $3.4m) – a fair markup on the £866,000 charged for the ‘ordinary’ P1. The asking price will include a program of track days at current Formula One circuits around the world, as well as advice and consultations with various McLaren people from the driver fitness team to Design Director Frank Stephenson – which could mean there’s a possibility of bespoke styling. Access to McLaren’s fabled racing simulators will also be included. p0210xr0

46,"On 15 June, seasoned racers and budding builders convened for qualifying rounds of the Soapbox Car Derby world championships in Berlin. It was the 25th running of the race, from which top qualifiers would move on to the national round in Brandenburg. The world championships are scheduled to take place on US soil later this year, at their traditional setting of Akron, Ohio.

Soapbox derbies (called seifenkistenrennen in German) have been fixtures of automotive culture virtually since the dawn of the passenger-car era. Lacking propulsion, drivers race down a slight incline in aerodynamic single-seat fuselages, with the goal of recording the fastest time on the course. Though the first derby cars were built from wood, today’s contraptions are aero-optimised bullets fashioned from fibreglass.

Portugal supporters may argue the point, but no oversold penalty or headbutt can compete for controversy with the scandal that rocked soapbox racing in 1973. American Jimmy Gronen, 14 at the time, had his world title revoked when it was discovered that he had affixed electromagnets inside the nose of his racer. A connection activated by pressure on Gronen’s headrest gave the car an (illegal) boost off the line.

Not exactly a “Hand of God” moment, but not far off the pace.

47,"The new Jaguar F-type doesn’t ape its grandfather, but rather updates it with a new, emphatically 21st Century interpretation of British sex appeal. It is voluptuous, aggressive and feline, with crisp edges atop its fenders that speak of laser-guided design tools.

The F-type is, as was the E-type, available as either a convertible roadster or fastback coupe. The lower end of the range is powered by a 340-horsepower, supercharged 3-litre V6 engine in its nose backed by an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission that can be manually shifted. For coupe customers there’s an “S” model that sees the V6 fortified to 380hp. But buyers in this class don’t go in for half-measures, and the V8-powered F-type have been most popular worldwide, with its supercharged 5-litre unit rated at a virile 495hp. Coupe buyers can thump even harder, with 550hp available from the range-topping R.

But with much of the world entering the longest days of their year, drop-top motoring in a loud, bawdy F-type V8 S convertible is the cubicle fantasy. With a claimed top speed of 186mph, this is one of the fastest convertibles on earth. If there’s some unfathomable need to travel at 187mph or faster in a British convertible, you’d have to part with a lot more than the V8 S’s $92,925 price of admission.

Granted, you’d also likely spend beyond $105,000 for the F-type V8 S once options such as heated steering wheel, sport seats, colour-coordinated seat belts and $12,000 carbon-ceramic brakes are added to the bill.

While the F-type carries everything a modern car should, it offers a raw, visceral, immersive driving experience like few other new cars can. Driver and passenger sit low in the cockpit, with the doors and cowl – the line where the windshield and dash meet – relatively high, creating a cocoon-like atmosphere even with the top down.

Despite being built mostly of aluminium, it can weigh more than 3,700lbs. But it doesn’t feel its tonnage. At 176in long, it’s only a fraction of an inch longer than the original 1961 E-Type and more than 8in shorter than the last, V12-powered version of the classic, giving it a taut, muscular feel down the road.

Push the anodised orange start button and the engine awakens with a ferocious growl, then settles into an eager idle. The roar returns as the car builds speed. This is a tightly suspended machine on low-profile tires; it’s not uncomfortable but hardly coddling. It is also one of the few new cars that has not adopted electric power steering, sticking with the better feel of traditional hydraulic assist.

The cockpit does not aspire to XJ sedan levels of opulence, but it’s a comfortable and serious place from which to conduct the business at hand. With back pressed against seat, wind rushing above and exhaust roaring behind, the F-type focuses a driver’s attention like few new cars do.

With its balance and raft of safety gear, the F-type represents a secure way to experience automotive rawness, a plush toy that can blast off at the slightest nudge. But maybe you want to fly without a net?

Then try…

Performance cars come no more raw than the Shelby Cobra 427 – a fragile, effete English AC Ace sports car fortified and battle-hardened to swallow the meanest American V8 the Ford Motor Company could build in 1965. If it were any more elemental, you’d have to duck to avoid being hit by the throws of the rotating crankshaft.

No traction control, no power steering, no ABS, no airbags, not even any side windows. Just 485 horsepower from a beastly 427-cubic-inch (7-litre) V8 engine capped by two four-barrel carburettors devoted to emptying the atmosphere of oxygen. And it weighed in at less than 2,900lbs – a half-tonne lighter than the F-type. Blip the throttle while out of gear and the entire structure rustles, creaks and groans under the torque. Running on massive Goodyear Blue Dot racing tires, the Cobra would, legend has it, blast to 100mph and back down to stop in only 14.5 seconds.

But real Shelby Cobras are such legendary monsters that collectors have pushed their prices into the stratosphere. In 2013 one of the 260 street-bound Cobra 427s sold at the Gooding & Company auction in Monterey, California, for $1.1m. Earlier this year one of the 23 Cobra 427s built for racing failed to meet its reserve after a $1.7m bid at the Mecum auction in Kissimmee, Florida.

So let’s dispense with an ugly truth: few people can afford a genuine Cobra 427. Fortunately, the world is awash in replicas. And the dirty secret is that because the real Cobra is so primitive, driving a replica can be better than driving an original. Or far, far worse.

See, the quality of replicas ranges from cheap fibreglass bodies duct-taped to flimsy chassis to re-creations done in better-than-original, highly polished aluminium bodies over chassis far superior to what Shelby peddled a half-century ago. The trick is in knowing what you’re looking at.

To go cheap, the sensible strategy is to scour the internet for what is generously known as a “project car” – something that someone, somewhere has lost interest in seeing through to completion. Over the years many replica kits were built by companies that have long since folded, so don’t expect how-to resources online or a friendly 800 number to dial in your darkest hour of wrench-turning. But with above-average mechanical skills and a decently equipped work space, you can pick up a bungled project car cheap and turn it into a true warrior. Just assess your abilities honestly.

At the top end are cars and components built by companies such as Kirkham Motorsports, of Provo, Utah. Kirkham sells a devastatingly beautiful aluminium-bodied replica rolling chassis of the street Cobra 427, which sits on a billet suspension that is a work of art in itself. The price – minus drivetrain – is $79,995 before hitting the options list. Want a bronze body with brush-etched stripes? That’s another $49,995. Want the big 42-gallon fuel tank? Cough up another $2,255. Kirkham will even sell you an aluminium, 625-horsepower version of the Ford 427 engine for a mere $24,995.

Somewhere between trying to save a basket case and blowing your retirement savings, there are replica bargains to be had ranging from complete cars indistinguishable from original Cobras to machines that make noise, earn double-takes, but would not stand up to an enthusiast’s scrutiny.

As with most things automotive, fun costs money, and the Cobra replica does not flout these laws. But whether spending $10,000 or $200,000, a resourceful buyer can tap the Shelby mystique at a limitless number of price points. All that’s left to reconcile is how much mystique you’re willing to accept, versus how much you can afford.

48,"When Andrew Dunn travelled to the Maldives with nine other people to celebrate his 50th birthday, he switched off his phone for the first time in years to spend time with his family and to explore the islands.

As the founder of London-based luxury travel firm Scott Dunn, he knew that he was part of a growing trend of celebrating important birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones with a carefully planned trip abroad.

With families now scattered across the globe, a reunion holiday is an increasingly popular choice. That same familial — and friend — diaspora also means people are taking much more time, often years, to plan for big gatherings to get all the pieces in place.

“People are realising that if they're going to invite 150 people to a big party, for the same money they can go away and celebrate with a tighter knit group of friends or extended family,” Dunn said, adding that grandparents often foot the bill for a multigenerational get-together.

But a once-in a lifetime destination celebration or milestone party takes careful financial planning. Consider that even a seven-day trip to Morocco could easily cost upwards of $10,000 for a party of 20 people, not including airfare and other incidentals. To make the most of a milestone celebration, it helps to have a plan.

Five years to go

Setting a realistic budget is your first task.

“You’ve got to start with the end goal in mind. What resources do you have and how are you going to save?,” said Michael Schweitzer, head of wealth sales and distribution at HSBC in the UK. “One of the biggest pitfalls is not being realistic about the time it takes to get there (financially).”

An online budget calculator can help you get started and simplify the process, and be sure to think of every possible cost you think you might incur.

“Most people tend to pamper themselves a little more during a trip of a lifetime, so remember to add in a buffer for treats and special experiences,” said Steven Ler, Senior Vice President of Singapore-based UOB Travel Planners, a subsidiary of United Overseas Bank.

Ask yourself whether you plan to treat others on the trip entirely? Will you pay for some things like meals or accommodation or special treats? Will you need to arrange transport or other details?

It’s vital to establish how much of the bill you will be footing and what others on the trip will pay for – and communicate this clearly to those you want in attendance.

For family milestone events, it is not uncommon for one person — or a few people (like grandparents or adult siblings) to cover the cost of accommodation and some meals and secure discount rates for excursions, but have attendees pay their own airfare and other incidentals.

Checklist: Five Years Before

Decide how many guests, where and what format

Set out what you will be paying for yourself or with others

Estimate a budget and monthly savings

Four years to go

Four years before the big event is the time to discuss your idea with family and close friends — and get anyone who might help plan and pay on board. You can brainstorm ideas and ensure everyone's input is included in the planning. Ensuring the key people are involved in the planning will avoid any disagreements closer to the event.

Research flights and hotels but also costs like taxis, restaurants, drinks and activities, to ensure the trip is within everyone's budget, not just your own. Organise your to-do lists and check dates. The party or trip might feel a little deflated if a key person is unable to make it as it out of their price range and they weren't given enough notice to allow them to save.

When Sarah Armstrong, 34, an interior designer based in France, decided, with her mother and brother, to throw a surprise party for her father’s 60th birthday, planning down to the smallest detail helped her stay within budget – about £6,000 ($10,000) for 100 guests.

She booked the venue about 18 months before the party and did not have to pay a deposit as she was a member of the Royal Air Force Club in London, where it was held. The club also provided caterers, meaning one fewer item on the to-do list.

At the time, Armstrong was living in the United Arab Emirates, so had to plan the party from a distance – she arranged everything except the live band, which her brother, a musician, organised.

She used Caxton FX, a currency conversion company, to transfer money from her account in the UAE to her UK account, waiting for a moment when the exchange rate was favourable. “If you use your bank overseas to send the money directly it’s highly likely you’ll be hit by charges at either end, plus an unfavourable exchange rate,” Armstrong warned.

Now is the time to really consider every budget item, including staff tips, which people tend to forget until last minute.

“Plan it very well so you don’t get any nasty surprises cost-wise,” Armstrong said. “Try to think back to an event you’ve been to and pick the elements that you definitely want, even down to details like place cards, extending bar hours or microphone hire – they all cost.” She also recommended including a 10-20% contingency fund for unforeseen costs.

Getting the most out of the money you’re saving can make a big difference, added HSBC’s Schweitzer. With four years to go, make sure you’re getting a good rate now that you’ve got a bit more saved.

“People think they can just keep their savings in cash but they are actually getting negative real returns as they don’t keep up with tax and inflation. They’re losing purchasing power,” said Schweitzer.

Checklist: Four Years Before

Choose a low-risk savings product with above-inflation interest

Do your homework and get family and key people on board

Factor in every facet of your overall budget

Two-to-Three years to go

Keep an eye on your ideal venue, location or holiday destination. Are you still keen on the same place you were two years ago when you first started planning? If not, has somewhere better caught your eye? Is the cost comparable or do you need to adjust your budget?

Now is also the time to contact venues and suppliers and find out how far in advance you will need to book and what kind of deposit you will need. Many of the most popular venues are booked 18 months to two years in advance and require a deposit.

""Letting guests know an outline of your plans two-to-three years before, and estimating what you think it’s going to cost, is a good idea,” US-based financial educator and broadcaster Alvin Hall said. You’ve already told them about the trip, now is the time to outline the expenses and their part much more clearly.

Reassess and get savvy about putting your money to work. Channelling everyday spending through cash back websites or a credit card that rewards you with air miles also makes your money work harder, Lisa Conway-Hughes, founder of the misslolly.com financial planning website, added – but make sure you pay off the balance each month to avoid charges.

One Singapore-based couple charged their wedding expenses and business trips to their UOB PRVI Miles Platinum American Express Card and exchanged their miles for two return business class tickets to South Africa for their honeymoon, UOB Travel Planners said.

Don’t miss out on good offers on hotels, flights, travel insurance or car hire that may expire nearer the time.

“Consider booking your trip at a travel fair,” said Ler. “Singapore hosts the annual National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS) travel fair during which travel agencies offer great deals on travel packages.”

He added: “You could even pick up a new set of luggage bags as these are often given out as complimentary gifts during the fair.”

Checklist: Two-to-Three Years Before

Try travel fairs for deals, and keep your guests informed

Be realistic: if you’re behind, rethink your budget or cut everyday expenses

Shift spending to a credit card that earns air miles, but be disciplined

One year to go

Start looking forward to your big celebration. Send out save-the-date emails or cards to remind your guests the countdown is on.

If you're flying to an exotic locale, schedule any inoculations you need and make arrangements if a visa is required. Consider writing a checklist for your guests to include with your 'save the date' to ensure that everyone is on track and made aware of any special requirements.

Now is also the time to tell your employer you'll be taking time off and to book your annual leave. Remind your family and other guests to do the same.

Focus on details that will free up spending money for treats: booking shared airport transfers for several people, for example.

“Booking a group dinner may cost less than just going to a restaurant – it’s about finding ways to make the trip more affordable,” said Hall.

If you're going abroad and will be spending a foreign currency, start researching the best exchange rates and currency offers for spending money, so you aren't stung by exorbitant rates or fees.

Finally, arrange any last minute minutia well ahead of time, such a writing place cards, song lists or menus. Then, with all your hard work done, you can focus on the fun and fabulous elements of your soirée. You can plan special treats, surprises and outfits.

49,"The city known for art, music, and design is also home to a growing technology industry and a booming convention business.

A former member of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, musician David Sancious has traveled the world on business. While he goes wherever the demands of touring take him, he adds time in Berlin for fun. That’s where his most recent gig, playing on rocker Peter Gabriel’s European tour, wrapped up. “It was my good fortune that we ended in a city like this,” the guitarist and keyboard player said, citing its surfeit of museums, restaurants and music venues. “Berlin is such a cool place.”

He’s not the only one who thinks so. For the last couple of decades the young and Bohemian have flocked to Berlin’s inexpensive real estate and 24-hour dance clubs, but the German city remained an economic backwater compared to thriving Frankfurt and Hamburg. Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, though, that’s starting to change. The city known for art, music, and design is also home to a growing technology industry and a booming convention business — last year it hosted 126,200 events that drew 10.6 million people, according to the Berlin Convention Office, continuing an upward trend. Events included ITB, a major tourism trade show, and IFA, a consumer electronics convention. Companies like Siemens, Bayer and Vattenfall all have outposts in town.

Airport

The city’s growing pains are best reflected in its airports. The Berlin Brandenburg airport was scheduled to open two years ago, but technical delays and mismanagement have hampered its debut. Instead Berliners are left with Tegel in the city’s Northwest and Schoenefeld in the Southeast. Tegel’s proximity to the city center means that for those traveling without checked bags, getting from plane seat to meeting can take as little as 30 minutes with a 20 euro ($27) taxi ride. A taxi from Schoenefeld into town costs about double the amount, but express regional trains run frequently from just outside the terminal to various parts of the city. Trains to Alexanderplatz, Hauptbahnhof (Central Station) or Zoologischer Garten take about 30 minutes and cost 3.20 euros.

Money Matters

Berlin is stuck in the past when it comes to paying with credit cards — most taxi drivers and many stores, restaurants and bars only take cash, so it helps to have euros on hand. Currency exchange businesses, which usually charge high rates, are best avoided in favor of the numerous ATMs. Bank of America and HSBC are among the financial institutions that have agreements with Deutsche Bank, allowing customers to avoid cash withdrawal fees.

Cultural know how

Berliners have a reputation for being less than friendly. In restaurants and stores, waiters or shopkeepers are less likely to make small talk than to subject visitors to “Berliner Schnauze,” as the local tendency towards gruffness is called. “Unfortunately the people are less inviting and friendly than in other European cities,” said Agota Angi, a marketing manager at Tjobsrecruit in Romania, who in May attended an event held by a Berlin-based venture capital firm.

The city’s international allure, though, is slowly changing its face. An increasing number of expat-owned locales mean that you can sometimes get the kind of customer service more familiar in North America. These days even a native Berliner might hold a door open for a stranger.

Hotels

Two hotels in the western part of town near the zoo offer easy access to points throughout the city.

The newly opened 25hours Bikini Hotel is for travellers who like to mingle. It has plenty of open-air common spaces and draws crowds to its top-floor Monkey Bar.

Those looking for more of an urban retreat should check into Das Stue, nestled in leafy Tiergarten park, where visitors are greeted by a giant alligator jaw in the lobby. Subtle animal-theme décor emphasizes the feeling of being in nature. For Sancious, Das Stue captures what he likes best about the city, which is its vast green spaces and lakes comprising nearly a third of the city’s land. “I feel such a connection to nature in this hotel,” he said.

For longer stays, the Gorki apartments are located on a busy street in Berlin’s central Mitte District. Set back from the street for guest privacy, the building comprises 37 modern apartments with names like Dr. Oswald and Fräulein Ilse, which come with well-equipped kitchens. The room rate, which starts at 115 euros, decreases for stays longer than a month.

Dinner for one

Street food with a German twist has arrived in Berlin. On Thursday evenings at Markhalle Neun, vendors sell global bites as well as local specialties like Käsespätzle, a noodle, cheese and onion dish from Heisser Hobel and pickled cheese and pretzels from Brot & Zeit.

Pauly Saal serves top notch regional fare from the surrounding state of Brandenburg, with main courses that include ox and venison. The restaurant is located in a 1930s building that had been Berlin’s first Jewish girls’ school and was recently renovated into a space with galleries and cafes.

Off the clock

The number of cultural attractions in Berlin is vast: Three opera houses, 150 theaters and nearly 600 museums and galleries in addition to a legendary nightlife and fledgling gastronomic movement. This year some highlights revolve around the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War and the 25th anniversary of the fall of Berlin Wall. The German Historical Museum is putting on a special exhibit tracing the outbreak of World War I that includes soldiers’ letters and photographs. On Nov. 8 and 9, the path of the former Wall will be lined with lighted helium balloons.

Sancious checked out the newly opened David Bowie exhibit, which originated at Britain’s Victoria and Albert Museum but is here adapted to reflect the iconic singer’s close ties to the city. Located at the Martin Gropius Bau near the studio where Bowie recorded his famous Berlin Trilogy albums, the exhibit displays postcards between the musician and Marlene Dietrich as well as secret police files on his concerts. The show closes in August.

50,"Mike Lewis first became hooked on cut-price private jet trips when he saw a deal offering four seats on a flight from his local airport near Los Angeles on an Embraer Phenom 100 jet for just $500, plus tax. The catch: the trip was the next day.

“The jet was going to Tucson, Arizona and I’d never been there,” he said. “So I took it.”

That was three years ago and since then Lewis, chief executive officer of property management company Concept Seven, which operates on the West Coast of the US, has become a regular private jet flyer — for business and pleasure. He takes one or two trips every month.

The bargains come from what are known as “empty legs” or “empty sectors.” That is, the one-third of private jet flights that wouldn’t otherwise carry passengers because the planes are in the wrong place at the wrong time. The next full-fare pickup for a wealthy flier or executive — or the jet’s owner — might originate in Chicago, but the jet is parked in Las Vegas. Costs for fuel and the crew add up.

That’s where passengers like Lewis come in. His deal came from JetSuite, which has become a pioneer in this area, releasing details of its cut-price “SuiteDeals” to followers on Twitter, Facebook and the web just a day before the flights. Flights cost $500 for up to 500 miles, $1,000 for 500 to 1000 miles and $1,500 for anything further, plus 7.5% federal tax.

The price includes all the seats on the jet, plus baggage, so if there are four seats, you can use one or invite friends or family and all four fly for one price. Most jets in the program offer four or seven seats.

Website EmptyLegMarket, meanwhile, currently has about 25 to 50 offers listed at any time, with the best deals available 10 days before a flight.

“It’s a real niche group of people who are able to go on these flights,” said Lewis. “They’re usually people… in their mid-thirties with the ability to jump on a flight at the last minute and [the ability] to spend the money.”

Buyer beware

Of course, there are drawbacks for both the jet owners and the last-minute fliers.

North America dominates the market, buying more than half the world’s shipments of business jets in 2013. These can fly to some 50,000 airports in the US, compared with about 550 that are served by scheduled commercial airlines. The small airfields are often more attractive to business travellers because they’re closer to meeting locations and help them avoid the hassle of excessive security procedures and waits.

That's a boon for executives who can attend several meetings in a day and still be home for dinner. But their convenience can leave potential buyers of empty legs stranded. First, travellers on empty leg flights have to figure out how to get from home to a small airport, then from another small airport to their final destination. Very few of these small airfields will have on-site car hire, so fliers might have to arrange a taxi or limo to get to their final destination. Then there’s the matter of getting home, usually on a scheduled flight at a bigger airport or waiting for another empty leg trip.

Even JetSuite, which offers some of the best deals on empty legs, has difficulty selling them.

“We post on average 10 SuiteDeals a day,” said JetSuite chief executive officer Alex Wilcox. “We sell three or four. They represent far less than 1% of our total revenue.” The company’s main business is full-rate charters. Lewis’s $500 flight to Tuscon, for example, would have cost about $6,500 at the company's normal retail rate.

Aside from charter operators selling their own empty legs, there are a growing number of brokers trying to link the fragmented private jet market by offering flights from a number of operators. Victor represents more than 100 operators, mostly in Europe, where there are more than 600,000 flights by private jets and turbo-props each year — of which around 200,000 are likely to be without passengers.

Victor typically has around 200 empty leg offers available, but they aren’t the eye-popping bargains offered by JetSuite. Recently, for instance, Victor’s website displayed an empty leg deal on a six-seat jet leaving three days later from Bristol in southwest England to the Spanish island of Mallorca for £3,630 ($6,386). According to Victor director of operations Mike Ryan, the full price to charter the same flight would be between £9,000 and £10,000 ($15,000 to $16,000).

“The sort of people we find using empty legs are already seasoned private aircraft travellers who know the system. They’re generally retired or semi-retired people with second homes in the south of France or wherever, who can be flexible about when they fly,” Ryan said.

Safety matters

While it might be more luxurious than being crammed into a coach cabin on a commercial airline, flying private isn’t entirely risk-free.

Although statistics indicate that all forms of flying are safer than travelling by road, private jets aren’t subject to the same level of regulation as commercial airlines. The minimum requirement for commercial charters is an Air Operator Certificate issued by the national aviation authority where the plane is registered. You should check that this is valid and that there has been an independent safety audit by the relevant organisation such as ARG/US or Wyvern.

Be sure to inquire about extra charges for, say, baggage or airport fees. These add-ons are rare but know before you buy. And be aware that some firms offer deals that aren’t actually available. In some cases operators will exploit your interest in private jet travel and then try you sell you full-price flights in a classic bait and switch, telling you the advertised offer has already been sold.

Still, if you can grab the bargain, the perks are very real. “Everybody wants to fly on a private jet, as I've discovered,” said Lewis, describing how finding bargain flights can make you rather popular. “Sometimes I'll invite friends and relatives and, not surprisingly, they're pretty happy to jump on board with me.”

51,"Becky DeSalvo was clicking around the web one day when she found a video of birds on Midway Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean after they had eaten plastic trash. The birds looked like they had blown up from the inside, little bits of bottle caps, lighters, and packages jutting out.

“It was just one of those Facebook things that was floating around. I showed it to my kids, and they were really bummed out by it,” recalled DeSalvo, a chemistry teacher in Ashland, Oregon. “They just started asking, what can we do?”

DeSalvo’s 10-year-old son Charlie had an idea: His school lunchroom could use metal instead of disposable utensils. He wrote a letter to the head of his school’s food service. She replied with a note of her own explaining that they previously tried using metal utensils but the children often threw them away.

So Charlie went to the student council. They rallied for the school to respond, adding bins in the lunchroom to collect the plastic utensils to show they could learn to save metal forks and spoons. Once the school saw the students could do it, they replaced the disposables with metal.

Now the schoolchildren are wondering what to tackle next.

“I think they feel empowered,” Becky DeSalvo said. “They know they have the power to make a difference, especially when they work together.”

It seems simple: if a bunch of middle school students with no real power can figure out how to be more environmentally conscious, so can managers in their workplaces.

It isn’t about jumping on a trendy environmental bandwagon so that your marketing department can brag about it on Twitter. With the world’s dwindling resources, companies nowadays should be thinking about sustainability as part of their long-term strategy.

“You get to the green thinking by asking how you can prepare your company for the future,” said Christoph Lueneburger, a German expat who leads executive search firm Egon Zehnder’s global private-equity practice in New York City. “Resources are becoming constrained, and that means many of the things we have been doing are going to become increasingly more difficult.”

Europe has long been out front on sustainability, Lueneburger said. In the UK, for instance, measuring a company’s carbon impact has become part of business. Some executives receive part of their bonus based on such achievements. Asian countries appear to be catching up, but the US is still behind in its willingness to really talk sustainability in the boardroom.

Managers ought to be bringing ideas on how to be more green to their supervisors, even if it’s not something in their remit or that the company itself is focused on, said Lueneburger, who is also author of the book Culture of Purpose: How to Choose the Right People and Make the Right People Choose You. Don’t start the conversation with how to save the Amazon. Instead, begin by selling how the idea can positively impact the company’s business model. Your best bet: focus on the supply chain or demand issues that are most likely to have an effect on your firm’s ability to make a profit.

“Before bringing it up the chain of command you have to ask, ‘What is the hook in what I’m proposing to make my business ready for a future where the supply of goods may change?’” Lueneburger suggested.

Of course, if you want to pitch an idea that will help the company, you will need tangible data and information. If you’re wondering now how to begin, that’s where someone like Anna Dengler of New York City-based Great Forest comes in. Her company consults with companies on how to become more sustainable.

The first step is to analyze the environmental impact of the resources you’re using, Dengler said. Then drill down into waste, like after-hour energy use or spikes in water supplies.

Finally comes the brainstorming, where you as a manager get your team together to figure out how to shore up the wasted resources. It may take some pretty tough calculations, too. A manufacturer that switches from steel to aluminum may increase costs today, but it may save money when steel becomes scarce.

“This is where managers are at their best,” Dengler said. “This is where you show your ability to creatively solve a problem.”

One company Dengler worked with found a simple solution. Corporate rules required special requests, like a car service for top clients, to be made on paper. That led to a lot of unnecessary boxes of paper and wasted toner cartridges. It sounded easy — just switch to email. But printing the request had become part of the office culture and suddenly everybody had to learn a new system.

“Usually the problem of company waste is obvious, but it’s the solution that’s challenging because it changes the office culture,” Dengler said.

That’s where the managers come into play again. Consider what happened at Walmart after the company launched a program to become more sustainable a decade ago. The retailer made widespread changes like using more energy efficient lights and trucks.

But it also looked at micro changes that can make impacts. One store employee noticed that the vending machines stayed lit all night, even when nobody was around to use them. The company instituted a chain-wide policy to unplug the vending machine light sources and saved a reported $1m per year.

There’s also the example of German shoe maker Puma, which began a sustainability program in 1993, long before sustainability became a trend. The company first studied its suppliers to figure out if they were sourcing materials responsibly. Then Puma switched away from materials it deemed could become scarce in the future. That cost the money in the short term but improved their image enough that the switch eventually increased profits, Lueneburger said.

The idea of how to use less scarce materials is not far off from the discussion the DeSalvo family is having since Charlie got his school to convert to metal utensils. This summer they’re planning to brainstorm other simple ways the school could become more sustainable.

“Charlie was always the kid with the messiest desk at school. He wasn’t the one that was so organized,” Becky DeSalvo said. “Then here he was getting his whole school motivated. It really shows you what one person can do to change something.”

Sure, the sustainability issues at your company may be bigger than a plastic utensil habit. But challenging the existing process to exact change works in offices — not just lunch rooms.

Has your company prepared for a future with fewer supplies? What ways have you found to make your business more sustainable?

When archaeologists excavate the foundations of present-day central London, they will find 1,000 mechanical diggers entombed in concrete. Note to the future: These are not sacrifices to some mechanical god, but the by-product of a fashion among the rich for adding basement swimming pools and media rooms.

We need such a theory because, first, it can help us achieve a calm, clinical understanding when confronting such a creature in the wild.” And we need a theory, second, because it may help us to see when we are jerks ourselves. “As one climbs the social hierarchy it is easier to become a jerk.

Will regulators hold back self-driving cars?

By pitching their first driverless cars towards the elderly and disabled, for short trips on slow local roads, Google is internalising the safety concerns that would probably block the immediate introduction of driverless cars for general highway use. It’s a win for Google, and for regulation. “It would not surprise me if regulators and politicians turn out to be Google’s friend in the driverless car business.”

Paper survives and thrives despite the digital revolution. “To the human mind, a sequence of pages bound together into a physical object is very different from a flat screen that displays only a single ‘page’ at a time. The physical presence of the printed pages, and the ability to flip back and forth through them, turns out to be important to the mind’s ability to navigate written works, particularly lengthy and complicated ones.”

Chess tournament games and Elo ratings

Randal S Olson | 24 May 2014

Exercises in data visualisation using results from 675,000 chess tournament games dating back to the 15th Century. Elo ratings reliably predict which player will win: “I’d imagine the only reason this trend levels out at ~90% is because this data set contains games where a talented new player hasn’t quite reached their proper Elo rating yet.” Playing white confers a strong advantage to an expert, less so to a rookie.

53,"Astronauts are a highly disciplined, highly trained bunch. After a rigorous selection process and at least five years of intensive training, they know how to fly a spacecraft, fix a space station and use a space toilet. But even then, nothing is left to chance.

The Russian Soyuz is currently the only spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), but getting on board involves a minefield of superstitions, procedures and etiquette. As I observed in Russian mission control recently, myths, legends and traditions have built up around launches ever since since Yuri Gagarin’s first orbit in April 1961. Not all of it makes sense. But when you are about to sit on top of 274 tonnes of explosive rocket fuel, you probably don’t want to push your luck by walking under any ladders.

Here is our list of some of the rituals you would need to follow before boarding a Russian rocket:

1. Cheerleaders



Baikonur in November. A piercing wind blows across the Kazakh Steppe lifting snow from the icy ground. The grey leaden sky blends into the grey of the airport runway. Icicles hang precariously from the broken guttering of the hangars.

A small jet aircraft taxis to a halt and men smothered in thick fur-lined coats position steps at the doorway. Three figures descend onto the cracked concrete as piped music blasts from a Soviet-era sound system. Then a line of women – also dressed in coats, hats and gloves – start waving glittering gold-coloured pom-poms in the air.

This is the traditional welcome that greets astronauts and cosmonauts arriving at Baikonur cosmodrome for their trip to space. Its origins are unclear but no flight is complete without a flurry of golden pom-poms.



2. Swivel chair



The most immediate, and debilitating, effect of leaving the planet is space sickness – a common complaint among even the fittest astronauts. With flights to the ISS now taking only six hours, and with dozens of complex course corrections to coordinate along the way, a vomiting crew is the last thing you need.

One of the solutions devised by Russian space physiologists is to attempt to deliberately disorientate the astronauts before they launch. A few hours before flight, each crew member is spun on swivel chairs and tilted upside down on special beds to prepare them for the zero-G experience.

There is some debate in the space community about whether any of this is effective. However, as long as you have a sick bag handy, it is at least something you can try at home.

3. A spade



One of the most poignant memorials to spaceflight is an avenue of trees at Baikonur. Planted over the past 50 years, each tree represents a mission and the cosmonauts who flew it. They not only commemorate those who made it into space, they also provide a living memorial to those who didn’t make it back.

Today, it is traditional for each crew member to plant his or her own sapling, a task that is relatively straightforward in the balmy Kazakh spring but less so in the bitter winter when the ground is rock hard.

4. DVD of cult 1970 film



What do you do the night before a launch? Watch a movie. But not just any movie. According to IMDb, The White Sun of the Desert is a “Russian twist on the American western”. It’s a Russian classic apparently, but as I’ve never seen it, I can’t really give an opinion. However, every astronaut that has flown from Baikonur since the early 1970s has ritually watched this film before launch.

5. A good signature

In Russia everything needs to be signed for and that includes your rocket. It is traditional for the crew to sign-off their spacecraft to indicate their approval that it is fit for flight. Given that they have not been involved in its construction, it is not clear what would happen if it turned out not to be.

The crew also sign a wall in the museum at Baikonur and the door of their bedroom at Baikonur after their last night on Earth. Like the trees, these serve as a testament to the longevity of the Soviet and Russian space programmes. On their return, the crew also very often sign the charred outer casing of their space capsule.

6. Coins

It is considered bad luck for the crew to watch their rocket being rolled out to the launch pad, so they are kept away. But, just as the crew have traditions to maintain, so do the engineers, support staff and astronaut families.

The Soyuz is moved from its hangar on a railway line, pulled along agonisingly slowly over several hours by a diesel locomotive. As the train inches towards the pad, spectators place coins on the track to be flattened by the wheels. This is believed to bring luck to the mission and, so far, has not led to any derailments or injuries.

Incidentally, once the rocket has reached the launchpad, it is blessed by a priest.

7. Cuddly toy



Watch the capsule interior video during any Russian rocket launch and you will notice a cuddly toy hanging from the instrument panel. For the most recent launch of Expedition 40 to the ISS, the toy in question was a cute toy giraffe belonging to the daughter of Nasa astronaut, Reid Wiseman.

Not only do these toys serve as mascots for the mission, they also serve a serious purpose. When the rockets have finished burning and the Soyuz reaches orbit, the toys will float free to indicate to the crew that they are now in weightlessness.

It’s the equivalent of using a canary in a mine to monitor air quality although, in this case, any toy animal is acceptable.



8. CD of Russian love songs



In the entire history of Soviet and Russian spaceflight – as far as we know – only four cosmonauts have lost their lives during a mission: the Soyuz 1 pilot, Vladimir Komarov, in 1967 and the three man crew of Soyuz 11 in 1971. No other nation has such a remarkable safety record and the Russians are keen to maintain it.

The logic of superstition follows that if something was done a particular way one mission and it was successful, then it should be kept that way for the next. Why risk change? One of these traditions can be traced back to the very first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin.

In April 1961, Gagarin was strapped into his capsule on the launch pad; the hatch had been closed, checks had been completed and he was ready to fly. With nothing to do but stare at the instrument panel a few centrimetres in front of his face, he requested that mission control play some music over the intercom. They slapped on a record of Russian love songs.

Exactly the same thing happens today, although the music selection can be broader and is selected by the entire international crew. For every Russian love song there is a bound to be at least one play of “Rocket Man” or German techno.

You can read more about music in space here.

9. Full bladder

Probably the most extraordinary tradition of the Russian space programme also goes back to Gagarin. Apparently (because no-one knows for sure), on his way to the launch pad Gagarin asked the bus to stop so he could relieve himself. He got out and urinated against the back right-hand tyre.

In 1961 this made complete sense, the world’s first spaceman did not want globules of urine floating around his capsule. It makes less sense today when astronauts wear nappies and are strapped into their three layer spacesuits, which are then sealed and leak tested before they get on the bus.

Nevertheless, male astronauts are still expected to leave their bus, unzip their suits and urinate on the back right hand tyre. Suit technicians then have to redo the palaver of zipping them all up again. Female astronauts have been known to bring vials of their urine to splash on the wheel.

10. A towel

Every space traveller knows that the most massively useful thing to have is a towel. Thanks to the late Douglas Adams’ hugely influential Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, alongside tens of thousands of others around the globe, some astronauts now commemorate Towel Day on 25 May.

A new space tradition that would surely make Yuri Gagarin proud.

54,"Olympia Colizoli doesn’t see the world like you. “To me, all time and numbers are arranged in physical space. Days, weeks, months, years, centuries all have shapes, and I use those shapes to organise my mental plan,” she says. “It took me a long time to realise other people didn't think in this way.”

Colizoli, a cognitive neuroscientist, experiences synaesthesia. Some people with this condition see colours, smells or sounds when they read words. In Colizoli’s case, numbers have a certain size, shape or other physical property. For example, people’s ages are expressed as a curved line. She also happens to study synaesthesia at the University of Amsterdam, curious to know whether she was born with her condition, or whether it was partly learned.

If you could teach yourself to see the world this way, it could potentially boost your creativity. Famous synaesthetes reportedly include Pharrell Williams who sees music in colour (and who told Oprah’s O Magazinehe couldn’t make music without it), and physicist Richard Feynman, who saw letters in equations as colours, and whose visualisation of quantum interactions won him the Nobel Prize.

But could it be possible to train yourself to see the world from a new, multisensory perspective? And if so, would it have the same effect as those to whom it comes naturally?

Synaesthesia was first recorded medically by Gustav Fechner in 1812, and since then estimates have put the number of people experiencing the effect at anywhere between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 23. The difficulty in knowing how many people experience synaesthesia is that like Colizoli, many people do not realise they experience the world any differently to other people. Even defining synaesthesia can be tricky because of the different ways in how people experience it.

To qualify as a synaesthete, the effect needs to be conscious, consistent and automatic. This distinguishes them from hallucinations, says Colizoli, because synaesthetes know that their world of colour or smell is not “real”.

No one is sure what causes synaesthesia, although it does seem to run in families. Colizoli notes that when you find one person who experiences the effect, it’s likely that another family member will report similar symptoms. This is known as developmental synaesthesia, and it differs to injury-related synaesthesia which results from brain damage – such as the man whose stroke left him uncontrollably excited by the James Bond theme tune. Synaesthesia is more common in those on the autistic spectrum, but as a group, synaesthetes do not show a higher prevalence of autism than the general population.

There’s some tantalising evidence that some aspects of synaesthesia can be learned. In a study carried out by Colizoli and her colleagues at the University of Amsterdam, non-synaesthetic people were given books to read in which the letters e, t, a and s were coloured while the rest of the text was left black. Despite reading the text as normal (and making no concerted effort to remember the colours), the participants began associating those letters with their colour.

Colizoli tested participants by flashing letters of the alphabet and asking them to name the colour the letter was written in. When a letter was written with a different colour to the one it had in the book, it took the participants longer to identify it – a cognitive delay known as the Stroop Effect. So while they weren’t ‘seeing’ colours, they did seem to be beginning to form the basic mental associations of natural synaesthetes.

However, the effect was short-lived. “They forgot the letter-colour pairs after several months,” says Colizoli. “And they did not report experiencing colour upon viewing black letters when reading.”

Memory stick

Natural synaesthesia does seem have an element of learning though – or at least, can sometimes be shaped by memorable experiences. Colizoli recalls a woman who identified each letter as having a distinct colour. One day she visited her elementary school classroom and discovered the brightly-coloured alphabet hanging on the wall matched how she saw letters – in learning to read and write, she may have subconsciously absorbed the colour as well as the shape of the letters. And last year, a study of 11 synaesthetes discovered that the particular colours they associated with letters were “startlingly similar” to those of a very famous Fisher Price fridge magnet alphabet set sold between 1972 and 1989. Ten of the test subjects recalled owning the set, and the 11th beat odds of a billion to one in matching 14 of their colour associations with the fridge magnets. So while these people may have been predisposed to synaesthesia via their genetics, how it manifested may well have been learned in childhood.

There’s certainly more to synaesthesia than early childhood memories – otherwise most people in the Western world would likely associate ‘M’ with the colour yellow thanks to McDonald’s ubiquitous golden arches. Why these colour associations take root in some people and not others is still a mystery.

And in any case, those that covet synaesthesia abilities should remember that a colourful, multi-sensory world can sometimes be a problem. Colizoli describes how one child she encountered found it difficult to read, because the black text had a bright associated colour, making it difficult to read against the white paper. Likewise, coloured numbers can prove confounding as well. Two numbers that have associated colours might combine in ways that don't make chromatic sense, so the result of adding a red number to a yellow number might not be an orange number. “My overall impression is that children are more likely to find it distracting compared to adults,” says Colizoli. “I believe adults usually have developed strategies to cope with it.”

I ask Colizoli if she thinks her habit of placing numbers in physical space has helped or hindered her career as a scientist. “I studied maths as an undergraduate and always visualised numbers,” she admits. “But it's a chicken-and-egg situation. Did the maths degree help me visualise numbers, or was it the other way around? It’s hard to say.”

Scientists like Colizoli are still unpicking how much of synaesthesia is genetic and how much is learned. While it appears that a typical person would struggle to train their brain to see a multi-sensory world like natural synaesthetes, there’s some tantalising evidence that elements of the condition can be acquired, at least temporarily. So if you believe your lack of synaesthesia is holding you back creatively, maybe you should try writing your ideas out in colourful pens, or even children’s fridge magnets.

55,"Traffic jams are the bane of motorists’ lives, whether it’s the daily bottleneck during the commute to work, or endless delays on motorways at the start of the holidays. If you think your journey is bad, spare a thought for drivers in Sao Paolo, Brazil – one evening in May this year, the traffic jams during rush hour added up to a 344km (214-mile) cumulative queue, according to the city’s traffic management agency.

Jams are not only frustrating, they are also a major contributor to air pollution, and that’s bad not just for our climate, but everybody’s health too. According to researchers at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, congestion in the 83 largest urban areas in the United States caused more than 2,200 premature deaths in 2010 and added $18bn to public health costs.

Then there is the economic cost of lost hours (both work and leisure) and delayed shipments. Drivers in the 10 most-congested cities in the United States sit around 42 hours in traffic jams every year, wasting more than $121bn in time and fuel while doing so.

This isn’t a new problem, of course. During the car boom of the 1960s, city planners had one seemingly obvious solution: build more and wider roads. But it didn’t work. The more roads created, the more cars they attracted. In California, for example, a 1997 study found that new, additional traffic will fill up to 90% of any increase in highway capacity within just five years.

While every city – whether London, Beijing or New York – has its unique set of traffic problems, there are a few common issues: many people insist on driving their own car, instead of sharing rides or using a bicycle; up to a third of cars on roads are drivers looking for a place to park; and then there’s the human factor: most of us simply are not very efficient drivers.

So what’s the solution? Some traffic planners are betting on car-pooling lanes, more park-and-ride opportunities, and improved public transport to ease congestion. Several cities have resorted to less subtle methods, like banning cars from driving on certain days, alternating between cars with licence plates that end in, say, even or uneven numbers.

Aggression vs timidity

But understanding what causes congestion in the first place may be the first step. Bottlenecks in the road and the sheer volume of cars are obvious sources. However, some traffic jams appear seemingly spontaneously, maybe caused by the “butterfly effect” of a single driver suddenly switching lanes, which results in cars behind him braking suddenly, with the ripple effect rapidly snarling up the highway.

A study by the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta blamed a combination of aggressive drivers – too fast and too close to the car in front – and timid drivers, who leave large gaps in traffic; both kinds force other drivers to brake, resulting in yet more ripples bringing traffic to a standstill.

Scientists have used many analogies to try to model traffic flows, from fluid and gas flow, to the movement of birds and skiers. However, says Gabor Orosz of the University of Michigan, “although such analogies may help scientists to gain some understanding, it is becoming more and more obvious that traffic flows like no other flow in the Newtonian universe”.

As much of this traffic is drivers looking for a place to park, some cities are trying to manage flow with systems that use sensors to determine whether a particular spot on the street, or in a car park, is occupied or vacant. Link these smart sensors with a system that guides drivers quickly and efficiently to vacant parking spots and the hope is this will ease congestion. The first trial of these sensors started in San Francisco, with Los Angeles not far behind, both cities currently being serviced by ACS, a Xerox subsidiary.

Two years ago in Russia, Moscow trialled smart parking providers and is now using a system developed by Worldsensing, says Mischa Dohler, professor at King’s College London and co-founder of the company. He says that with nearly 20,000 smart parking spaces, Moscow is by far the largest smart parking smart city deployment in the world.

The number of traffic jams has gone down, Dohler says, “mainly because people are being informed about the non-availability of parking, and they thus keep out of the narrow one-way streets in the centre.”

Cascades of congestion

However, ending this curse of congested city streets may need more of a radical rethink. What if the solutions begin not with the roads – but with the cars themselves?

Using wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, cars could talk to each other in an attempt to keep traffic flowing more smoothly. “In many cases, congestion is triggered by human behaviour,” says Orosz. “Humans react to the motions of the vehicles immediately in front with a reaction time delay. The impact of this is that they often amplify the ripples created by other drivers tapping the brake. As the congestion wave cascades along the chain of vehicles, eventually it grinds traffic to a halt.”

But if cars could communicate with each other in real time, these ripples could be smoothed out. “Your car may monitor the motion of a vehicle five vehicles ahead and prepare for what is going to happen – by braking earlier but less intensively,” says Orosz. “The information received may be presented to the driver, such as advised speed, or used by controllers in the automobile to assist the driver.”

Orosz is now conducting a safety pilot model deployment with about 3,000 vehicles equipped with the technology that broadcasts their GPS location and speed every 100 milliseconds.

Other ideas are trying to enlist the help of drivers negotiating their way through the clogged roads. Israeli start-up Waze, bought by Google last year, uses crowdsourcing to make clever use of our congested roads. The Waze smartphone app works like a social network for drivers, combining online maps with updates from other drivers about traffic jams, road works and accidents. “Waze takes advantage of side streets, surface roads and empty pockets of space to route cars via the least congested passages of road, spreading traffic across the grid rather than only one major road,” says Waze’s spokeswoman Julie Mossler.

Platooning vehicles

Another company, Urban Engines, has a slightly different approach. “For commuters, we’re providing an online game that offers trip suggestions and randomised rewards through a micro-raffle to incentivise commuter behaviour changes, including shifting travel from peak to off-peak times,” says Shiva Shivakumar, Urban Engines’ co-founder and chief executive.

For the past two-and-a-half years, the company has conducted pilot studies on public transport or driving in major cities, including Bangalore and Singapore. In Bangalore, one-in-six people who took part in the trial started travelling off-peak, and in Singapore – up to one-in-eight.

One other option to get rid of traffic jams, some think, would be to automate the driving process itself. Google recently unveiled its smiley-faced prototype of a driverless car; one of the computing giant’s intentions is that the car will help cut down congestion.

“Having automated driving in cities allows for platooning – a much denser packing of cars in streets and also through junctions – which, if the total amount of cars is controlled, allows one to significantly reduce jams,” says Dohler.



But others think this solution doesn’t go far enough – and that we should provide more reasons for putting less cars on the road. “The only effective long-term solutions are to improve alternative modes – walking, cycling and particularly high quality public transit,” says Todd Litman of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute in Canada. Road pricing that charges motorists extra if they drive during times of congestion could be one option. Cities like Singapore, London and Stockholm have successfully used road pricing to cut the amount of traffic. The carrot, in turn, would be a great public transport system, say with extra bus lanes, nicer train stations and “cup-holders” and on-board wi-fi on commuter buses, says Litman.

And, he adds, this solution could be implemented within a few months. It is routinely done during major events such as Olympics and World Cups, when host cities convert general traffic lanes into special event lanes to insure that athletes, coaches and officials arrive at the venues on time. “During the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics there were no traffic problems, and even affluent commuters such as my downtown lawyer brother-in-law took the bus to work. Yet, once the event was over, the lanes reverted to general traffic and traffic problems returned,” he adds.

Perhaps it’s also time to return to our pre-car roots. Before the age of cars and trains, rivers and lakes were important inland waterways in countries such as Britain and Sweden.

Karl Garme, a researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, is now conducting a study called Waterway 365. Funded by the Swedish Maritime Administration, the current initial phase aims to research the issues crucial to making use of waterways “as an infrastructural resource for public transport and city logistic systems over the 365 days a year”, says Garme. Vancouver, Sydney and Istanbul are already cities making good use of their waterways. “The question is not land or water, but integrating the waterways in the present system and incorporating it when planning new,” he says. “It means that the traveller shall easily change from commuter train to underground or boat or bus or… preferably not even thinking about means of travel, simply take the suggested route from a travel planner.”

The solution to beating traffic congestion in cities, if it comes, will probably take a long time to reap rewards. But if at least some of these new ideas are a success – whether it’s driverless cars, smart parking spaces or commuter apps – the days of Sao Paolo’s epic tailbacks may finally be consigned to history.

56,"Hurricanes, mudslides, earthquakes and terror attacks often leave widespread damage – and those injured can often be very hard to reach for search and rescue teams.

Robots can play a vital role in getting life-saving aid to those in need. In fact, Dr Robin Murphy, director of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue at Texas A&M University says they have already had an effect, having been used in incidents such as the 9/11 attacks and the Fukushima tsunami in 2011.

Robots help because they are small enough to enter confined spaces, or they can fly above damaged areas cut off from road transport, which allows rescuers isolated from the scene to find those in most urgent need of attention.

Having been on site at Ground Zero in New York City within 24 hours of the 9/11 attack, she says robots have a big part to play because they are able to make ""the invisible visible”.

Dr Murphy spoke to BBC Future at SXSW Interactive in Austin Texas.

57,"Cast your mind back across the turbulent events of recent history. Did you foresee President Obama’s election before he was even elected as a Democratic candidate – or did you back Hillary Clinton? How about the Arab Spring – could you hear the revolution in the first tremors of dissatisfaction? And did you faithfully predict the recent Ukraine crisis?

If you answer yes to these questions, you could be a “super-forecaster”, someone who is able to foresee the outcome of world events with astonishing accuracy. This has nothing to do with the reading of tea leaves; nor do you have to be a seasoned political pundit. Some super-forecasters are just everyday people, from all walks of life, who happen to have astonishingly perceptive judgements.

Over the last few years, psychologists have found a series of “hidden” talents for extraordinary mental skills that can go unnoticed by the people harbouring them. There are “super-recognisers”, for instance, who can easily remember people’s faces, even if they had only met the person once, years before. Other gifted individuals include super-tasters, who have an intense perception of flavour and super memorisers who naturally recall events from almost every day of their lives.

Those talents might be largely down to our genes, whereas forecasting ability should, in theory, be down to experience and learned skill. Yet top political experts tend to perform very poorly at crystal ball gazing: Philip Tetlock at the University of Pennsylvania has found they do only slightly better than chance. “Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes would have done almost as well as the experts,” is how one political scientist summarised the findings to the New York Times.

Needless to say, military intelligence agencies have been watching closely. Inspired, in part, by one of Tetlock’s reports, the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) sponsored the four-year-long “Good Judgement Project” that aimed to find new approaches to political forecasting. Taking the form of a tournament, it recruited thousands of participants from all walks of life to test their forecasting skills on a range of questions, such as “Will Robert Mugabe cease to be President of Zimbabwe by 30 September 2011?” or “Will Greece remain a member of the EU through 1 June 2012?” Rather than simple yes or no answers – which cannot reflect the inherent uncertainty of life – they were asked to estimate the probability that each event would occur.

Three years into the tournament, Tetlock’s team has now released some of its first results to the journal Psychological Science, and at the annual meeting of the Association for Psychological Science in San Francisco last month.

One of the main aims was to see whether certain forecasters were consistently good. So after one year Tetlock checked the results of more than 2,000 participants and siphoned off the top 2% – the so called “super forecasters”, who then formed teams for the rest of the tournament. At the end of the second year, their performance was up to four times more accurate than other participants.

Hidden talents

Although political expertise may have helped, they came from a variety of professions. “One of the best forecasters was a pharmacist,” says Tetlock.

As you might expect, these elite forecasters tended to score better on measures of intelligence than the other participants. But they all shared one other trait too: open-mindedness. In everyday life, open-mindedness may be mistaken for having liberal political views, but in psychology it is thought to reflect how well you deal with uncertainty. Crucially, open-minded people tend to be able to see problems from all sides, which seems to help forecasters overcome their preconceptions in the light of new evidence. “You need to change your mind fast, and often,” says Tetlock.

Another trait of effective forecasting that Tetlock highlights is self-awareness – understanding your own foibles. Even expert forecasters may fall into certain traps, so Tetlock’s team decided to test whether an hours’ simple training could help his forecasters avoid the most common mistakes. He is reluctant to give too many details of the methods, in case it influences his forecasters’ future performance, but he points out that too often forecasters begin by taking an “inside view” of a problem; when considering whether Mugabe would remain in power, for instance, they might begin by looking for measures of unrest in the country.

Yet research suggests that you could come to more accurate predictions if you instead take a step back and simply look at past historical data. So in the case of Mugabe, you might consider how long the average dictator clings to power, before refining your estimate. Other strategies were aimed at reducing known cognitive biases. For instance, research has shown people tend to make better decisions if they are reminded of common pitfalls, such as the tendency to exaggerate the risk of particularly frightening events, like a terrorist attack; they could also remember to consider both the best and worst case scenarios of a situation, since that opens the mind to the full range of possibilities and helps to question your basic assumptions about the event. These tactics may seem obvious, but all the available evidence on human irrationality suggests they are easily forgotten – even by those who should know better.

Tetlock is also looking into ways to exploit the forecasters’ collective intelligence. Many psychologists believe that experts working in teams perform worse than those working individually, since they soon become “yes men” who reinforce each other’s biases. “It becomes the madness of the crowds,” says Tetlock. But with some training on how to critique others’ views, and respond positively to alternative viewpoints, the participants achieved the best results when they were allowed to cooperate more actively.

Ultimately, the team hope these discoveries could change the way governments make decisions. “It’s not about the business of prophecy – it’s the business of clarity,” he says. “We want to increase the intellectual honesty of predictions.”

58,"In 1910, a strike broke out at the Watertown Arsenal near Boston, when a manager with a stopwatch stood behind a worker, timing the craftsman’s performance.

“No tyrant or slave driver in the ecstasy of his more delirious dream ever sought to place upon abject slaves a condition more repugnant,” said one labour leader.

The factory was instigating new scientific management practices – innovated by Frederick Taylor and known as Taylorism – to increase productivity and efficiency. But the workers rebelled. Taylorism, which required industry to run factories like military operations with managers barking out orders to hapless subordinates, treated workers as mindless drones, the strikers argued.

Fast-forward to the present day, and a new form of hyper-efficient management may be about to arrive, but with a technological twist. In the never-ending quest for productivity, automation has already come to many spheres of industry. If so, your next boss might not be a tyrant or even a softie. Your next boss could be a machine.

The idea that robots and algorithms will take jobs is a common concern about the future. As Bill Gates argued earlier this year: “20 years from now, labour demand for lots of skill sets will be substantially lower.” Automation has already removed the need for humans in many workplaces, from building cars in factories to taking bookings in call centres. And scientists at Birmingham University in the UK are testing whether an autonomous security guard can do a real job in a working office.

However, one question rarely asked is: what would it be like to work for a machine? After all, a mixture of humans and machines is a more likely scenario for future workplaces.

Bare bones

To an extent, basic machine managers are already here, especially in the online world. On Amazon’s Mechanical Turk – an internet marketplace where people called Turkers offer their services – much of the actual people coordination is done by an algorithm. The Mechanical Turk software lists available tasks, everything from drawing a logo to transcribing audio recordings. Based on the past performance of Turkers, an algorithm will place them higher or lower down the list of potential candidates for a job or adjust their payment scales.

Other services, such as MobileWorks, use similar software to recruit and pay workers for small tasks such as taking a photo or checking a spreadsheet – all independently of any human hand. And Freelancer.com, which advertises jobs to people such as software engineers, writers, or architects, has software that decides to dish out more work to the higher-performing freelancers.

While these algorithms are not particularly autonomous by the standards of a human being, they do perform the bare bones tasks of an employer: task allocation, evaluation and payment for a job done well.

Some algorithms have even begun cracking the whip as people go about their work, much like the Taylorism stopwatch-holders in 20th Century factories. The writer Mac McClelland, for example, recently described her time spent working in an online retailer’s warehouse. Each worker was given a handset that told them where to go in the warehouse to pick up an item to prepare it for delivery. McClelland told how the handset would count down how many seconds she had to reach her destination, as well as tracking her underperformance if she overran its timing. While a human boss was ultimately responsible for her line management, for most of the day, it was the machine that was in charge.

So could algorithmic bosses eventually make their way into the office, where humans still rule? There are some signs that we might be headed that way, at least in terms of the outsourcing of many management decisions. Many companies are beginning to use “people analytics” – historic information on an individual’s online behaviour – to analyse prospective job candidates. Analytics teams in human-resources departments of large corporations such as Google and General Motors, for example, use algorithms to comb through the vast amounts of data collected on online interactions. In goes every forum comment, tweet, or public Facebook status, and out pops a number representing a candidate’s suitability for a position.

Unbending rigidity?

Could software designed to sift through an individual’s data trail not just hire employees, but also evaluate them, and possibly even fire them as well? It’s unclear, but it does raise serious questions about how much autonomy we might want to give algorithms in workplaces.

Some are bullish about the idea of algorithmic managers, however. “Honestly, it is actually better for workers having computerised bosses,” says Daniel Barowy, who created Automan, software to delegate tricky tasks to human workers via platforms such as Mechanical Turk. Machines are unbiased and unaffected by office politics and daily mood swings – unless of course they are programmed to be.

While Teresa Amabile, professor and director of research at Harvard Business School, isn’t quite so emphatic, she believes that automated systems may have the edge on human bosses in some instances. Amabile coauthored a book, The Progress Principle, which was based on a multi-year analysis of more than 200 workers’ diaries. For happier and more productive employees, she says, clear-cut directions, an atmosphere where it is OK to make mistakes, and autonomy proved essential.

The right algorithm could certainly achieve some of these goals: It could provide clear instructions, process information at lightning speed and multitask with an almost negligible margin of error, removing the frustrating bottlenecks that frequently pile up at the bosses door. And although computers can be picky pedants when it comes to employee errors, they don’t micromanage or make mistakes personal – a frequent source of office malaise.

But efficiency and unbending rigidity could also be the downside of machine bosses. How do they account for an erstwhile good employee who has a spot of poor health, or one is distracted on the job because of a sick child?

One-on-one

“I think that it will be a way long time before computers will make good bosses because they just don't have enough nuance,” says Sandy Pentland, the director of the Human Dynamics Laboratory at MIT, who believes that his research using specialised electronic “badges” backs up his opinion. The badges record about 100 data points a minute about wearers’ social interactions – such as how much they talk, how much they listen, and their tone of voice.

Using these badges on about 2,500 people in different organisations, Pentland was able to tease out how bosses can interact with workers to promote productivity and job happiness. “It is not just words or facts that matter, it is how you say it,” Pentland says. “There is a human side that goes on in a discussion and that is just as important.”

Pentland’s assertion is backed by results from Google’s 2009 research, Project Oxygen, where statisticians analysed more than 10,000 observations about managers from performance reviews and feedback surveys. The project found the best managers were those that made time for one-on-one meetings and who took an interest in employees’ lives and careers.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, people perform better with encouragement, respect and a sense of affinity for where they work. “To have these you need a real human, right there in front of you,” Amabile says.

And if the eventual backlash against Taylorism in the 20th Century taught us anything, it is that dehumanising work comes at a cost, most of all to human happiness. Robots and software may soon be more than capable of doing your boss’s job, but the ultimate question may be whether you would choose to work for them.

59,"Each week on The Forum, a global thinker from the worlds of philosophy, science, psychology or the arts is given a minute to put forward a radical, inspiring or controversial idea – no matter how improbable – that they believe would change the world.

This week, professor of globalisation and development Ian Goldin of the University of Oxford proposes fact-checking applications for our smartphones and computers that would warn us when we’re being told something that’s not true.

“Politicians, media pundits, writers and students get away with claims that are not based on fact.

If I was ruler of the world for a day, I would install fact-checker apps into our smartphones, into our computers, so that when facts were broken, when people told lies, or told mistruths, our phones went “Brrrrrrrr!” or the lines on our computer screen popped up in red. That way, we’d know what was fact and what was fiction.

Of course, I wouldn’t apply it to everyone. I wouldn’t apply it to poets, to novelists and others who specialise in imaginary ideas. My aim is to ensure that we benefit from the age of the internet of things to have an internet of facts and ideas, and through this we would hopefully get away from the infuriating falsehoods that are being widely disseminated.

Over time, good ideas would be spread far and wide, and bad ideas would be seen as a joke, rather than being the source of misinformation and perpetuating ignorance.”

60,"Passing fields of soy, corn and towering bleach-white windmills fanning out across windy plains, I arrive early one morning somewhere between Chicago and Indianapolis at a place that promises “sow much fun”.

The Pig Adventure, housing 3,000 sows and producing 80,000 piglets per year, sits alongside a 36,000-cow Dairy Adventure. This is “agro-Disneyland”, a place where rides have been replaced by adorable pink piglets and 72-cow robotic milking parlours.

I line up next to a retired couple and an extended family with three freckled kids from Chicago, and our tour starts inside a sleek lobby outfitted with touch-screens and billboards illuminating the intelligence of pigs – as smart as three-year-olds, better at learning tricks than dogs, outranked in brainpower only by chimps, dolphins and elephants. We pass through a mock shower where animated bubbles slide down the walls to clean us, and into a wide, carpeted corridor. Everything smells as pleasantly antiseptic as a dentist’s office. Arriving at a viewing area, we ogle some real pigs through thick, soundproof panes of glass.

Here, visitors can see for themselves how, even in today’s global, supermarket era, ‘Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations’ – or factory farms, as they’re better known – can continue to operate on gargantuan scales while still paying heed to animal welfare. Places like The Pig Adventure exist because this clash of practical and moral needs is becoming a massive consumer sticking point.

The fact is, with a global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, meat-eating is skyrocketing. To keep up with the demand, we need to produce considerably more meat than we do today – but we also want to reduce animal suffering. Conscientious carnivores may harbour romantic visions of returning to an earlier, more wholesome way of life, where animals live outdoors surrounded by rolling hills and lush woodlands. But such ideals are expensive and impossible to scale up, leaving today’s farmers asking how, or even if, we can both mass-produce animals and treat them right.

Is there any way to reconcile these demands? There are no easy answers, but that’s not stopping some researchers, farmers and veterinarians trying new ideas and technology to improve conditions of large-scale pig farming while also meeting humanity’s insatiable need for meat.

To understand how we got to this point, we first need to examine how centuries of breeding created pigs as we know them, and the way they are farmed.

The birth of the modern pig is a love story of sorts, the tale of how a Western sow and an Eastern boar came to find one another.

Before moving to the farm, pigs roamed the forests, foraging several kilometres a day for food. Like today’s feral pigs, these animals were fierce and agile, unlikely candidates for domestication. But the animals had one great boon: they made excellent garbage disposal units, eating up scraps and refuse that might otherwise rot. That perhaps explains why, several thousand years ago, humans in China and Europe independently domesticated the pig.

In the early 1600s, European farmers began selecting for larger pigs – genetic analysis has revealed that, as a result of the breeding, the Western pig developed two to three extra vertebrae.

Then improved breeding came in the form of a fat, black pig from China. Nobody knows how that first Chinese pig wound up in Europe, but genetic evidence dates that momentous encounter at around 1700. Initially, these couplings vexed the Europeans, who warned farmers against breeding their pigs with the Chinese interloper. Soon, though, the Agricultural Revolution made growing plants and animals year-round paramount. European farmers, stuck to a seasonal fattening cycle, began to realise the Chinese pig’s potential.

True acceptance came soon thereafter when the offspring of these pairings were observed to fatten faster than the European hog alone and produce considerably more offspring. Soon enough, the modern pig, a European–Chinese cross, thundered onto the scene, ravenous for food and sex.

In the US, breeders in Philadelphia had also begun selectively breeding Chinese pigs by the late 1700s. Meanwhile, Midwesterners were facing a surplus of corn, and so began fattening pigs on their crops and shipping them instead. In 1816, the Ohio Valley Shaker Society mixed local pigs with Chinese pigs ordered from Philadelphia. Pretty quickly, this new hybrid pig, with all its desirable qualities, became America’s pork.

Farming of the modern pig on an industrial scale, however, only really began in the mid-20th Century. In the 1940s, a shrinking agrarian population, coupled with a newfound fear of hunger, meant the time was ripe for moving Henry Ford’s automobile assembly line – a mix of machines, tools and employees working seamlessly in sequence – over to the farm. After observing the Chicago meat-packing operations, Ford himself once called slaughterhouses “disassembly lines”.

Electric lights and climate control let farmers move pigs indoors, where they occupied less space and ate less food. Antibiotics kept diseases in check. But lots of pigs in small spaces invariably led to problems. Piglets’ tails were cut off to prevent tail-biting and the males were castrated to stop them from developing ‘boar taint’, chemical compounds that alter the flavour of meat (people describe the taste as onion-like, perspiration-like, urine-like, bitter, and faecal). Meanwhile, breeding females, still wired for a more solitary life in the wild, began fighting over territory and food. Less aggressive sows grew thin and sickly.

In the 1960s, a new practice emerged that would shape the future of pig farming: the introduction of the “gestation crate”. These two-foot by seven-foot enclosures house a pregnant sow individually, protecting her but restricting her movements to the extent that she cannot turn around. Back then, they were seen as a welfare advance. Sows received personalised care. Injuries dropped. And piglet counts increased. The pig factory had reached its apogee.

Today, however, attitudes have changed. Gestation crates have emerged as a touchstone animal welfare issue. “Animal advocacy groups have been very successful in reducing sow animal welfare to whether a sow can turn around,” says Thomas Parsons, a veterinary researcher who directs the Swine Teaching and Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.

The European Union completed a ban of these crates in January 2013. New Zealand is poised to follow suit in 2015 and Australia in 2017. In the USA, where corporate pressure rather than legislation tends to drive changes in the food industry, scores of companies, including Smithfield Foods – the largest pork producer in the world – and McDonald’s, have pledged to eliminate gestation stalls from their supply chains.

For several years, Parsons has been talking to pig farmers around the USA about how to transition from gestation crates to a different kind of open pen. He and others at the University of Pennsylvania created the pen prototype over a decade ago, adapting European practices to meet the needs of North American farms.

So how does it work? I am seeing for myself today at Parsons’ lab.

Clad in borrowed blue overalls and rubber shoes, I wade into a sea of some 200 pregnant sows. One chews my shoe. Others brush up against me as they wander around the pen, threatening to knock me off balance with their 500-pound heft.

An electronic feeding station sits in the middle of each pen and when a sow saunters in, a door closes behind her to keep others out. A machine inside the station reads the 15-digit tag on the sow’s ear to see whether or not she has eaten for the day and, if not, how much food she should receive. Without this machine, the sows, who are very hierarchical, would fight over access to the communal trough, explains Parsons. Pigs who aren’t eating wander the grounds or congregate inside the large cubbies that line the pens like giant shoeboxes.

Last summer, Parsons helped install a similar system on a much grander scale at The Pig Adventure. Those pens, which house 85 to 200+ sows apiece, are viewable from a circular observation room high above the action and resemble rows of greenhouses filled with pigs instead of plants. A farm manager I spoke to referred to the pens fondly as “concrete pastures”. But there’s more to the pens than meets the eye, says Parsons. Those cubbies let sows of the same clique hang together and keep others out. The long pathways let sows escape the onslaught of a bully.

Parsons clearly isn’t keen on the phrase “concrete pasture” and says he avoids the term “factory farm”. “Words matter,” he tells me on several occasions. His caution stems from a position between two polarised communities: animal farmers, and animal advocacy groups concerned by conventional farming practices.

Parsons grew up on a pig farm in Massachusetts and his family descends from a long, long line of pig farmers. “The second best thing you can be as a farmer’s son is to be a veterinarian. The first best thing would be to come home and take over the farm.” His brother freed him from that duty, and after veterinary training Parsons went on to gain a doctorate in neuroscience. For a long time, he worked in the basic sciences, using animal models to better understand human hearing and deafness. But a fellowship in Germany and trips to farms around Europe kept the plight of pigs and pig farmers in Parsons’s orbit. Eventually, he decided that others could carry on the ear work but he was less sure that anybody would improve the living conditions of gestating sows in a way that was also financially viable for both the farmer and the consumer.

Even so, Parsons and colleagues’ pen design can affect productivity, says Jon Hoek, vice president of pig production at Belstra Milling, the farm behind The Pig Adventure (an umbrella company known as Fair Oaks runs the tourism arm of the Pig and Dairy Adventures, while farmers retain control of production).

“The transition has been difficult,” Hoek says. Before the switch, he explains, an average sow successfully birthed and nursed 31 piglets per year. Now, however, her success rate has dropped to 29 piglets, meaning each sow produces 308 less pounds of pork annually, or 1,232 fewer quarter-pound servings. (Pigs on the company’s five other farms continue to gestate in crates).

What’s more, shifting sows from individual to group housing comes with other challenges. In crated systems, sows have limited interactions and never get the chance to fight. But in a pen, scuffles are a part of life. I’d seen so myself at Parsons’s lab.

On the day I’d visited, 10 sows, marked by two orange stripes across their flanks, re-entered the pen after several weeks of birthing, nursing and getting pregnant again. They bounded across the slats separating the pen from the gestation crates, where they’d been barricaded for a week during the artificial insemination round. For several minutes, all was quiet. Then suddenly, two Orange Flanks, each now uncomfortably positioned near the bottom of the pecking order, began butting heads like rams in battle. Loud snorting ensued. Soon one sow retreated. The other, emboldened by her triumph, struck up another fight. Surprisingly, this alpha Orange Flank scored another win. She was moving on up.

Such fights make for tricky business. Reintroductions must occur before the embryo implants into the uterine wall – about two weeks after insemination – otherwise the sows can miscarry. With large systems like that at The Pig Adventure, it can be challenging to prevent the pigs, who are constantly moving throughout the system (Parsons calls it a “big chess game”), from fighting when their embryos are particularly vulnerable. Parsons says some farmers who have switched over to these pens keep sows in gestation crates for five or six weeks after insemination, instead of one, to thwart the problem altogether, but that comes with a potential welfare trade-off.

He suspects the fighting can provide some sows with stimulation, a way to express their natural urge for hierarchy, but at the possible risk of pain and injury. His team has also noted that sows in the pen typically enter the feeding station in the same order, with dominant sows getting first dibs. Once you get to a large enough group, the aggression seems to go down some because the hierarchy is less rigid. “It’s just too hard to remember who you don’t like,” he says.

Parsons acknowledges that production levels may initially fall as farmers learn the nuances of the new system, but they’ll ultimately rebound. According to Hoek, 94% of pigs carry their piglets to term at Belstra’s best farm, but at The Pig Adventure that rate has dropped to 88%. Hoek concedes that The Pig Adventure will eventually regain its high birth rate.

Perhaps there could there be another way to encourage pigs to live peacefully in open pens. What if, Parsons and others have begun to wonder, we could breed pigs to be more suited to communal housing? “The industry for 30 to 40 years has been selecting for animals to perform in some type of stall or crate,” says Parsons. “I can see where we might be inadvertently selecting for traits that would be successful in a stall but problematic in a pen.”

This has some precedent. Some 30 years ago, Bill Muir, a geneticist at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana, started looking into animal welfare on chicken farms. Then as now, many chickens lived in battery cages, enclosures the size of a filing cabinet that could hold up to a dozen birds. The chickens, who like to peck everything, began pecking each other – occasionally to death. That led to the acutely painful practice of beak-trimming on day-old chicks. Muir suspected he could build a better battery-cage chicken, one that didn’t peck at all.

Muir started off with several 12-bird battery cages, each housing sister birds with intact beaks, and isolated calmer family lines, selectively breeding along those lines. The results were astounding. Annual mortality among birds with intact beaks had started at an astronomical 68%, but after just six generations it had dropped below 9%, the same level seen in single-bird cages.

Yet most conventional breeders still only look at an individual’s genetics and not at how that individual interacts with the larger group. With the push towards group housing for chickens and pigs growing stronger, Muir, along with Piter Bijma, a geneticist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, has been creating statistical models that quantify the influence of a single animal on her groupmates. Recently, the Wageningen team tested their models on actual pigs. The researchers estimated a pig’s likelihood of aggression from the models, and then selectively bred them. Sure enough, they were able to predict the more aggressive members.

Researchers have the tools to breed for less aggressive families, says Bijma. “It’s not at all to the animal’s benefit to have [so many] characteristics of its wild ancestor.”

Farm animals inhabit human-designed homes and bodies that we have tweaked, and continue to tinker with, across millennia. We are, without exaggeration, the creators of their world, and they our greatest resource – and heaviest burden. If they suffer, does the fault lie in our failure to innovate?

What began as an experiment to cross-breed Chinese and European pigs in the 1700s has now reached a scale so large that it demands our attention, whether you agree with industrial farming or not.

In the maternity ward of The Pig Adventure, I watch thousands of piglets nap under heat lamps or suckle fervently at their mamas’ teats. As I’m leaving, one of the workers comes up to the glass carrying a newborn piglet that has been scrubbed clean. The family from Chicago crowds in for a closer look. What should we name it, the worker asks through a microphone. The youngest freckled Chicagoan suggests “Liam” and the matter is settled. The worker returns the little piglet to his mother and we all disperse. On my way out, I peer into the glass one last time, but Liam has been lost in the throng.

Stress can lead to burn-out, whether you're a chief executive or a shelf stacker.

Hector Sants, the former boss of the Financial Services Authority, had to bow out from his compliance role at Barclays Bank because of stress and exhaustion.

Nor is the world of sport immune. England batsman Jonathan Trott recently left the Ashes tour of Australia owing to a long-standing stress-related condition.

But these are just high-profile examples of a much wider problem.

Workers in the UK took an average 5.3 days off work in 2012, according to the 2013 CBI/Pfizer Fit for Purpose survey, with stress, anxiety and depression given as the main causes of absence.

Sick leave is costing the UK economy £14bn a year, the report suggests. So there is a strong financial incentive for businesses to keep their ""human capital"" as healthy and happy as possible.

Most large businesses offer some form of stress and anxiety counselling, coupled with flexible working to help employees manage their work/life balance.

For example, telecoms group BT offers its staff a real-time online chat facility with Relate, the family relationships charity, that can provide anonymous and convenient help.

Monitoring stress levels

But a growing number are also using the latest diagnostic testing equipment and a range of new technologies to help them spot problems before they arise.

Joe Dunbar, director of operations at IPRO Interactive, a health diagnostics provider serving sport, the military and the corporate sectors, says: ""We can now measure employee stress levels using a portable saliva testing machine that can give us an accurate reading in minutes, rather than hours in a laboratory.""

The reader, which costs about £1,500 and is manufactured by German medicare company Qiagen, measures levels of the main stress hormone cortisol, as well as other hormones such as testosterone and immunoglobulin.

High stress levels can reduce our immune systems and make us more susceptible to illness and coronary heart disease, research shows.

Image copyright IPRO Interactive Image caption Qiagen says portable diagnostic machines such as its hormone reader are particularly helpful for businesses with mobile workforces

""Once we know what an employee's stress level is we can then put interventions in place,"" says Mr Dunbar, ""from encouraging more exercise to changing work patterns.""

English Premier League football clubs, such as Manchester United and Manchester City, are big users of the technology, he says, to help them devise bespoke training regimes for their their highly-paid players.

Tuberculosis threat

Image copyright complete coherence Image caption Sarah Watkins says allowing executives to monitor their heart rate can help prevent burn-out

Martin Potgeter, Qiagen's senior director of corporate development, says portable diagnostic machines are particularly helpful for international businesses whose mobile workforces are vulnerable to picking up infections and diseases as they travel between countries.

One area of growing concern is latent tuberculosis (TB), which lies dormant in people but can become active if immune systems are weakened.

About a third of the world's population has latent TB, says the World Health Organization (WHO), and roughly 10% of those go on to develop the highly-infectious active form of the disease.

In 2012, 8.6 million people fell ill with TB and 1.3 million died from it, the WHO says.

""Latent TB testing for industry is one of our fastest-growing markets,"" says Mr Potgeter. ""Our clients include Guinness, Heineken, Exxon Mobil, Mercedes Benz and NASA.""

The Qiagen hormone reader is being adapted to allow TB tests in the new year, he added.

Complete Coherence, a ""bio-science-powered performance coaching"" company whose clients include Unilever, BT, the Post Office and Deutsche Bank, uses heart rate monitoring and hormone measurement to help senior executives achieve a healthier, more productive lifestyle.

""Heart rate variability is a good indicator of burn-out and potential sudden death,"" says Sarah Watkins, the company's founding director.

""Using our wearable cardiosense trainer and uploading the data to our software programme can help executives change their breathing and improve their heart rate. It's all about preventing disease before we have to treat it.""

'Nudge' tactics

But this kind of personal monitoring using the latest hi-tech equipment is still expensive, despite the fact that such diagnostic kit is becoming cheaper.

Companies with large workforces are resorting to ""nudge"" tactics instead - encouraging rather than enforcing healthier living.

Stress test Image copyright Thinkstock How stressed are you? Take our test to find out

StepJockey recently unveiled its Department of Health-backed scheme to add ""smart labels"" to workplace staircases, enabling users to work out how many calories they burn when they use the stairs and incorporate that data into a fitness-tracking app.

John Harries, head of health and life sciences for Samsung Enterprise Business Europe, says: ""The big breakthrough in workplace healthcare will be around the use of consumer electronics and smartphones. These things are a lot cheaper than purpose-built devices and they are familiar to use.""

Smartphones, smartwatches and sensor-laden wristbands can already measure heart rate, blood pressure, and calories burned through exercise, with all the data uploadable to software programs that can track performance and provide advice and encouragement.

""The next iteration of our Samsung Galaxy phone will have more health sensors built in,"" says Mr Harries. ""The direction of travel is to build up this kind of health monitoring capability even more.""

The main barriers to wider adoption of such technology in the workplace are ethical not technological, he argues, because there is still a stigma attached to mental health.

""The danger is that if you're struggling in your job and becoming anxious about it, you may feel under pressure to manage your own condition, worrying that your employer might use it as an excuse to get rid of you.""

This is why building trust between employer and employee is key, he says.

65,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption A mobile state of mind: mobile phones, mobile workforces, mobile data

This year was the year we all went mobile. And we're not just talking smartphones and tablets.

We're talking mobile workforces staying connected in and out of the office and using their devices for work and play.

We're talking mobile data, stored in the cloud; and mobile corporate structures trying to adapt to the new age of data sharing, collaboration and crowdsourcing.

Mobile didn't simply refer to a gadget, but to a state of mind.

New paradigm

And this new mobility, powered by the roll-out of faster 4G networks, brought many challenges as well as opportunities for business.

David Chan, director of the information leadership network at Cass Business School in London, believes that networked mobiles have caused a fundamental shift in our behaviour - the way we shop, work, create and interact - but that many businesses failed to adapt to this new paradigm.

The world is moving so fast our grand IT plans are almost obsolete before they've even been started David Chan, Cass Business School

The demise of traditional High Street retailers, such as HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops, in the face of the online shopping revolution was a case in point.

""This was the year we began to realise the limitations of our current mindset,"" says Mr Chan. ""We still follow a Newtonian model - we see businesses as machines we can control.

""We need to move to a more organic organisation - senior managers have to learn to let go. Agility and innovation are not compatible with this old mindset.""

This failure to adopt more fluid, situational management structures results in major IT failures, he argues, from the botched launch of ""Obamacare"" health insurance in the US, to the online banking breakdowns suffered by Royal Bank of Scotland and its subsidiaries, Ulster Bank and NatWest.

""The world is moving so fast our grand IT plans are almost obsolete before they've even been started,"" he says.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Current technology infrastructures have their limitations

Damian Saunders, a cloud networking director at Florida-based virtualisation and software company Citrix Systems, agrees.

Speaking to Technology of Business reporter Paul Rubens in November, he said: ""I take a contentious view and say that IT outages are rarely to do with technology. There's normally a role that technology plays in the outage, but when I look at the root cause, by far the greatest cause is people and processes.""

In other words, not updating software or not testing systems sufficiently. This year exposed the limitations of our creaking technology infrastructures, our legacy computer systems, and our outmoded managerial thinking.

Sharing generation

In 2013, powerful smartphones equipped with accelerometers, GPS navigation systems, high-definition cameras, clocks and wireless connectivity, began to be used in all sorts of innovative ways.

Image copyright Proteus Image caption Healthcare is increasingly using technology to assist patients

Fiona Graham reported in July on how a California Institute of Technology (Caltech) team created an app, CrowdShake, that can turn a smartphone into a simple seismometer capable of detecting vibrations from earthquakes.

By sharing data amongst a community of users, early warning systems like this can potentially save lives.

In other features, we explored how personal healthcare went mobile, with smartphones now measuring our heart rates, blood pressure and calories burned, recording data we can upload, visualise, share and learn from.

This trend towards sharing and collaboration challenged the traditional corporate desire to command and control.

Crowdsourcing, engineering and science expertise accelerated a number of projects, from DNA analysis to app design.

Data tsunami

Image caption The ""internet of things"" allows household objects to go online and communicate with each other and people

Meanwhile, microchipped objects capable of recording and sharing data wirelessly, and working in combination with smart analytical software, began to accelerate our understanding of how the ""internet of things"" was changing the world around us.

From pills that text you once you've taken them, to home heating systems that can be controlled remotely by mobile phone, connectivity opened up a myriad of new possibilities.

But all these digital sensors have led to an exponential increase in data, requiring storage, protection from prying eyes, and practical analysis.

""Big data"" became a catch-all phrase covering a multitude of topics, but boiled down to smart ways to make this data truly useful.

Clever software drew shapes from the data blizzard, enabling firefighters to identify the most risk prone areas of a city; the police to spot patterns of behaviour that led to the arrest of criminals; and financial institutions to mine audio recordings for potentially fraudulent conversations.

Security threat

The business impact of the US National Security Agency's Prism digital surveillance scheme, as revealed by Edward Snowden's leaked documents, warrants a feature all to itself.

But in short, business confidence in the confidentiality of corporate data and the security of cloud-based data storage services took a real battering in 2013.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Security concerns hit the headlines around the world in 2013

Cyber security and the threats from extortionist hackers, intellectual property thieves and fraudsters, rose swiftly up the agenda for most companies.

And the rapid rise of mobile helped exacerbate these concerns, as IT managers struggled to enforce security protocols governing their use.

Samsung's Knox platform offered one encrypted, password-protected solution to the problem, whereby a walled-off section of the smartphone could be controlled and protected by the employer, leaving the rest of the employee's phone free for Angry Birds and indiscreet conversations.

Perhaps the last word should go to Gartner's Steve Prentice, who showed admirable prescience in January.

""More cloud computing, services and storage. More mobile devices with more apps, more games, more browsing, more shopping and more sharing with our 'friends' on social media. All of which increases the demand for bandwidth, faster speed and universal coverage,"" he said.

""And with the marketing muscle of big corporations in support, countless millions of machines (from simple sensors to jet engines) will join the digital conversation, building the internet of everything, delivering an accelerating flow of data and the consequent demand for advanced analytics.""

What the US Supreme Court decides in a key court case involving Argentina and its bondholders will greatly impact how sovereign debt restructuring is done in the future.

The essence of the decade-long lawsuit between the country and a handful of its creditors is: Can bondholders demand full repayment of what they lent to a country even when others have settled for a haircut?

Argentina's 2002 default of around $100bn (£61bn) was the largest at the time, until Greece's around 200bn euros debt restructuring.

What the US Supreme Court decides could have bearing on the question of so-called ""hold-outs"".

In 2005 and 2010, 92% of Argentina's bondholders accepted around 30% repayment in two debt exchanges.

But not two hedge funds, NML Capital and Aurelius, who are demanding 100% repayment of their $1.3bn lent to the country.

Argentina's position is that these creditors won't be paid at all since they refused to participate in the debt exchanges.

But an influential US appeals court ruled that Argentina cannot just pay the ones that accepted the debt restructuring, but must repay all of its creditors, including the hold-outs.

If it doesn't, then it opens the possibility of a technical default by the country.

Argentina is expected to petition the US Supreme Court to hear this case in the coming weeks before a February deadline.

This issue is proceeding in part to the highest court in the US, since the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a narrower case about whether two banks have to reveal information about Argentina's assets to its creditors, NML Capital and Aurelius.

Eurozone impact

So, what does this have to do with the eurozone?

Most sovereign bonds are issued under New York or English law, and Argentina's has a so-called pari passu clause, which mandates equal treatment of all bondholders.

So, what the Supreme Court decides, and whether the influential second circuit case stands, will greatly impact how sovereign debt restructuring is done in the future.

This was the view of the International Monetary Fund when the lower court decision came out last year.

In 2012, Greece's debt restructuring wasn't just the largest on record, but also the first by an European country since World War Two.

Some of its bonds were issued under English law and have pari passu clauses.

Most of the large bondholders at the time of Greece's debt restructuring two years ago accepted a ""haircut"" of around 75% except for 6.6bn euros of bonds held by hold-outs.

These were subsequently, and perhaps surprisingly, paid in full by the Greek government, ostensibly to avoid the type of lawsuits faced by Argentina.

But, it also set a precedent that could make future debt restructuring difficult, since bondholders may be less inclined to take just 25 cents on the euro if they know that holdouts will be paid in full.

Blanket cover?

To try and address this, the eurozone has imposed so-called collective action clauses (CACs) in new issues of euro zone government debt.

It reduces the likelihood of holdouts since a majority of bondholders will be able to accept a debt restructuring and impose it on the remaining creditors.

These came into effect last January and it's estimated that they will be the majority of eurozone bonds by 2020. But, even then, there will be bonds that don't have CACs and of course there's also those pari passu clauses to consider.

Most of Greece's bonds didn't have those clauses. In other words, some creditors like the European Central Bank can be accorded special treatment, which arguably helped politically - since the central bank likely didn't take losses like private creditors.

But, there was a minority of Greek bondholders that did, since such clauses tend to exist for bonds governed by English or Swiss law.

It means that bondholders seeking better protection against enforced losses would do better to seek out the protection of foreign laws. It is what happened in Russia during its 1998 default, when it forced losses on holders of bonds issued under Russian law but serviced in full those governed by English law.

Voluntary restructuring?

There are other complications as to whether a debt restructuring can really be ""voluntary"" if the alternative is no payment at all.

Whether it's voluntary or not matters since it could trigger payout on credit default swaps (CDS), which act as a form of insurance against government default.

It would constitute a technical default and have the impact as if debt was not paid, which tends to make a country a pariah on international bond markets for years. It's essentially what every country seeks to avoid.

This brings us back to why the US Supreme Court decision will be closely watched.

If the second circuit case is heard and upheld, then Argentina case makes it harder to undertake sovereign debt restructuring.

For several eurozone and other countries with ""debt overhang"" above what the IMF says is a critical level of exceeding 100% of GDP, it limits their options considerably.

So, what Argentina and two hedge funds do in the US could change the landscape of the global bond market, and the options for the eurozone still struggling to fashion institutional solutions to shore up the single currency.",Why eurozone should monitor US Supreme Court decision on Argentina,http://www.bbc.com,"[Linda Yueh, Chief Business Correspondent]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/67517000/jpg/_67517638_yueh464x261.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25708792

Big banks beware - innovative technology challengers are coming to eat your lunch.

That was the key message emerging last week from FinTech City London, a series of events for financial services technology professionals organised by the CEO Agenda and Icon Corporate Finance.

Fintech, as financial services technology is modishly called, is enabling nimbler, hi-tech companies to re-engineer most financial activities, from payments processing to personal loan applications, and cut out the middleman.

It's what Clayton Christensen, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, calls ""disruptive innovation"".

While the things we do with money - save, borrow, invest, spend - have not changed much over the centuries, the way we interact with financial institutions is ""drastically changing"", said Alex Scandurra, director of innovation strategy and business development at Barclays.

'The micro multinational'

And that's largely to do with mobile, open-source databases and cloud computing. About three-quarters of the UK population owns a smartphone, and there are more than five billion mobile phones globally.

Image copyright funding circle Image caption Funding Circle provides a direct link between investors and small firms

""As a result of the proliferation of technology, digital, and now mobile with it, the barriers to entry have significantly decreased,"" said Mr Scandurra. ""Now we're seeing that teams of 10 to 15 people can actually take on the large incumbents all around the world.""

Whereas big financial institutions have to cater for a mass market and try to please everybody, small fintech companies can focus on niche markets, globally spread. They can form what futurist and writer Alvin Toffler called ""the micro multinational"".

One such company is Funding Circle, the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending service launched in 2010, which aims to provide businesses with access to loan funding while providing investors with a decent return on their money. Its 65,000-plus investors have lent over £208m to UK businesses so far.

In March 2013, the UK government began lending £20m to British businesses through Funding Circle as part of its Business Finance Partnership scheme.

Co-founder and chief executive Samir Desai said that while his company had certainly benefited from the 2008-13 banking crisis and the consequent collapse of trust in High Street banks, it is new open-source technologies and databases that have enabled P2P lending companies to grow.

""Every loan that goes through Funding Circle is funded on average by 700 different people,"" he said ""Those loans can then be bought and sold by other investors through a secondary market. So we have as many mini-loans going through our system as any bank, and thousands of secondary market transactions going through each day.

""We couldn't have done that without these new open-source technologies.""

New credit scoring system?

Open-source databases that anyone can access and adapt, such as Hadoop and Cassandra, can process and structure vast amounts of data from a wide and growing range of sources, including social media, helping P2P lenders and other financial companies assess creditworthiness to much higher degrees of accuracy than before.

Image copyright Space Image caption Mobile payment companies like Square offer new technology to merchants

""Banks haven't started to embrace these new types of technology,"" said Mr Desai. ""So we can lend to businesses they wouldn't even consider.""

So now even your Twitter comments could affect whether or not you're granted a loan, and companies like Facebook could end up displacing old-fashioned credit reference agencies.

Giles Andrews, chief executive and co-founder of Zopa, a more established P2P lender founded in 2005 that has lent more than £455m to individuals and sole traders, agrees that customer data - its efficient collection and analysis - is key to success these days.

""The business is not a bank and I'm not a banker,"" he added. ""We're more of a data company.""

Corporates and small businesses are going to be able to pick and choose their niche service providers Alex McCracken, Silicon Valley Bank UK

This is why Zopa has just hired its first ever chief data scientist, he said, who comes not from a bank, but from Amazon, the online retailer.

Legacy issue

Newer fintech companies are not encumbered by old technology, the so-called legacy systems that traditional banks struggle to integrate with newer software and hardware.

The Lloyds Banking Group IT glitch, which affected debit card and cash machine transactions at the weekend, is the latest in a long line of big bank technology problems.

""It's an opportunity for the new challengers who don't have that legacy issue,"" said Sue Langley, chief executive of UK Trade & Investment's Financial Services Organisation, ""because it's much easier with a blank sheet of paper to.... come up with something new.""

Image copyright the currency cloud Image caption The Currency Cloud provides technology to international payments companies

""The banks have an increasing need for technology,"" said Mark Boleat, chair of the City of London's policy and resources committee. ""Some of that comes from their huge IT departments, but an awful lot of it is coming from new and start-up businesses.""

Alex McCracken, director of ventures groups at Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm, believes we will see a polarisation in financial services, with global all-you-can-eat banks serving multinationals at one end, and small, technology-driven niche players serving local needs at the other.

""Corporates and small businesses are going to be able to pick and choose their niche service providers,"" he said.

The mouse that roared

Mobile payment companies like Square, simpler direct debit providers like GoCardless, and foreign currency specialists like The Currency Cloud, all are offering financial services at lower cost and greater convenience through clever use of the latest technologies.

Are the big banks running scared?

Last week, US banking giant Wells Fargo banned some of its staff from investing in for-profit P2P lending companies, such as Lending Club and Prosper, admitting that they were competitors.

That is the wrong approach, argues Barclays' Alex Scandurra. His bank is collaborating more with tech entrepreneurs and start-ups, as well as offering non-banking products such as Cloud It, an online data storage service.

He calls the approach ""amplification through collaboration"".

Labour leader Ed Miliband may want to increase competition by forcing big UK banks to offload High Street branches, but to many observers, this is a red herring.

As Technology of Business begins a month-long series of features on the theme of Big Data, we kick off with a Q&A backgrounder answering some of those basic questions you were too afraid to ask.

What is big data exactly?

Good question. After all, we've always had large amounts of data haven't we, from loyalty card schemes, till receipts, medical records, tax returns and so on?

As Laurie Miles, head of analytics for big data specialist SAS, says: ""The term big data has been around for decades, and we've been doing analytics all this time. It's not big, it's just bigger.""

But it's the velocity, variety and volume of data that has merited the new term.

So what made it bigger?

Most traditional data was structured, or neatly organised in databases. Then the world went digital and the internet came along. Most of what we do could be translated into strings of ones and noughts capable of being recorded, stored, searched, and analysed.

There was a proliferation of so-called unstructured data generated by all our digital interactions, from email to online shopping, text messages to tweets, Facebook updates to YouTube videos.

Image copyright AP Image caption As the number of mobile phones grows globally, so does the volume of data they generate from call metadata, texts, emails, social media updates, photos, videos, and location

And the number of gadgets recording and transmitting data, from smartphones to intelligent fridges, industrial sensors to CCTV cameras, has also proliferated globally, leading to an explosion in the volume of data.

These data sets are now so large and complex that we need new tools and approaches to make the most of them.

How much data is there?

Early adopters of Big Data analytics have gained a significant lead over the rest of the corporate world Bain & Company

Nobody really knows because the volume is growing so fast. Some say that about 90% of all the data in the world today has been created in the past few years.

According to computer giant IBM, 2.5 exabytes - that's 2.5 billion gigabytes (GB) - of data was generated every day in 2012. That's big by anyone's standards. ""About 75% of data is unstructured, coming from sources such as text, voice and video,"" says Mr Miles.

And as mobile phone penetration is forecast to grow from about 61% of the global population in 2013 to nearly 70% by 2017, those figures can only grow. The US government's open data project already offers more than 120,000 publicly available data sets.

Where is it all stored?

The first computers came with memories measured in kilobytes, but the latest smartphones can now store 32GB and many laptops now have one terabyte (1,000GB) hard drives as standard. Storage is not really an issue anymore.

Image copyright AP Image caption The US National Security Agency has built a huge data centre in Bluffdale, Utah - codenamed Bumblehive - capable of storing a yottabyte of data - that's one thousand trillion gigabytes

For large businesses ""the cost of data storage has plummeted,"" says Andrew Carr, UK and Ireland chief executive of IT consultancy Bull. Businesses can either keep all their data on-site, in their own remote data centres, or farm it out to ""cloud-based"" data storage providers.

A number of open source platforms have grown up specifically to handle these vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently, including Hadoop, MongoDB, Cassandra, and NoSQL.

Why is it important?

Do you know your big data numbers? 1,000 bytes = one kilobyte (kB) 1,000 kB = one megabyte (MB) 1,000 MB = one gigabyte (GB) 1,000 GB = one terabyte (TB) 1,000 TB = one petabyte (PB) 1,000 PB = one exabyte (EB) 1,000 EB = one zettabyte (ZB) 1,000 ZB = one yottabyte (YB) (Figures are decimal, not binary)

Data is only as good as the intelligence we can glean from it, and that entails effective data analytics and a whole lot of computing power to cope with the exponential increase in volume.

But a recent Bain & Co report found that of 400 large companies those that had already adopted big data analytics ""have gained a significant lead over the rest of the corporate world.""

""Big data is not just historic business intelligence,"" says Mr Carr, ""it's the addition of real-time data and the ability to mash together several data sets that makes it so valuable.""

Practically, anyone who makes, grows and sells anything can use big data analytics to make their manufacturing and production processes more efficient and their marketing more targeted and cost-effective.

It is throwing up interesting findings in the fields of healthcare, scientific research, agriculture, logistics, urban design, energy, retailing, crime reduction, and business operations - several of which we'll be exploring over the coming weeks.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption By analysing weather, soil, topography and GPS tractor data, farmers can increase crop yields

""It's a big deal for corporations, for society and for each individual,"" says Ralf Dreischmeier, head of The Boston Consulting Group's information technology practice.

Can we handle all this data?

Big data needs new skills, but the business and academic worlds are playing catch up. ""The job of data scientist didn't exist five or 10 years ago,"" says Duncan Ross, director of data science at Teradata. ""But where are they? There's a shortage.""

And many businesses are only just waking up to the realisation that data is a valuable asset that they need to protect and exploit. ""Banks only use a third of their available data because it often sits in databases that are hard to access,"" says Mr Dreischmeier.

""We need to find ways to make this data more easily accessible.""

Businesses, governments and public bodies also need to keep sensitive data safe from hackers, spies and natural disasters - an increasingly tall order in this mobile, networked world.

Who owns it all?

That's the billion dollar question. A lot depends on the service provider hosting the data, the global jurisdiction it is stored in, and how it was generated. It is a legal minefield.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook's logo - created using photos of its global users - adorns the wall of a new data centre in Sweden - its first outside the US. But who has rights to all the data?

Does telephone call metadata - the location, time, and duration of calls rather than their conversational content - belong to the caller, the phone network or any government spying agency that happens to be listening in?

When our cars become networked up, will it be the drivers, owners or manufacturers who own the data they generate?

Social media platforms will often say that their users own their own content, but then lay claim to how that content is used, reserving the right to share it with third parties. So when you tweet you effectively give up any control over how that tweet is used in future, even though Twitter terms and conditions say: ""What's yours is yours.""

70,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Would your chances of finding love online be improved if dating agencies knew far more about you?

If you want to know if a prospective date is relationship material, just ask them three questions, says Christian Rudder, one of the founders of US internet dating site OKCupid.

""Do you like horror movies?""

""Have you ever travelled around another country alone?""

""Wouldn't it be fun to chuck it all and go live on a sailboat?""

Why? Because these are the questions first date couples agree on most often, he says.

Mr Rudder discovered this by analysing large amounts of data on OKCupid members who ended up in relationships.

Dating agencies like OKCupid, Match.com - which acquired OKCupid in 2011 for $50m (£30m) - eHarmony and many others, amass this data by making users answer questions about themselves when they sign up.

Some agencies ask as many as 400 questions, and the answers are fed in to large data repositories. Match.com estimates that it has more than 70 terabytes (70,000 gigabytes) of data about its customers.

Applying big data analytics to these treasure troves of information is helping the agencies provide better matches for their customers. And more satisfied customers mean bigger profits.

US internet dating revenues top $2bn (£1.2bn) annually, according to research company IBISWorld. Just under one in 10 of all American adults have tried it.

The market for dating using mobile apps is particularly strong and is predicted to grow from about $1bn in 2011 to $2.3bn by 2016, according to Juniper Research.

Porky pies

There is, however, a problem: people lie.

To present themselves in what they believe to be a better light, the information customers provide about themselves is not always completely accurate: men are most commonly economical with the truth about age, height and income, while with women it's age, weight and build.

Mr Rudder adds that many users also supply other inaccurate information about themselves unintentionally.

""My intuition is that most of what users enter is true, but people do misunderstand themselves,"" he says.

For example, a user may honestly believe that they listen mostly to classical music, but analysis of their iTunes listening history or their Spotify playlists might provide a far more accurate picture of their listening habits.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Can big data analytics really engineer the perfect match?

Inaccurate data is a problem because it can lead to unsuitable matches, so some dating agencies are exploring ways to supplement user-provided data with that gathered from other sources.

With users' permission, dating services could access vast amounts of data from sources including their browser and search histories, film-viewing habits from services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, and purchase histories from online shops like Amazon.

But the problem with this approach is that there is a limit to how much data is really useful, Mr Rudder believes.

""We've found that the answers to some questions provide useful information, but if you just collect more data you don't get high returns on it,"" he says.

Social engineering

This hasn't stopped Hinge, a Washington DC-based dating company, gathering information about its customers from their Facebook pages.

The data is likely to be accurate because other Facebook users police it, Justin McLeod, the company's founder, believes.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Dating site Hinge uses Facebook data to supplement members' online dating profiles

""You can't lie about where you were educated because one of your friends is likely to say, 'You never went to that school',"" he points out.

It also infers information about people by looking at their friends, Mr McLeod says.

""There is definitely useful information contained in the fact that you are a friend of someone.""

Hinge suggests matches with people known to their Facebook friends.

""If you show a preference for people who work in finance, or you tend to like Bob's friends but not Ann's, we use that when we curate possible matches,"" he explains.

The pool of potential matches can be considerable, because Hinge users have an average of 700 Facebook friends, Mr McLeod adds.

'Collaborative filtering'

But it turns out that algorithms can produce good matches without asking users for any data about themselves at all.

For example, Dr Kang Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of Iowa and an expert in business analytics and social network analysis, has created a match-making system based on a technique known as collaborative filtering.

Dr Zhao's system looks at users' behaviour as they browse a dating site for prospective partners, and at the responses they receive from people they contact.

""If you are a boy we identify people who like the same girls as you - which indicates similar taste - and people who get the same response from these girls as you do - which indicates similar attractiveness,"" he explains.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Do opposites attract or does it come down to whether you share friends and musical taste?

Dr Zhao's algorithm can then suggest potential partners in the same way websites like Amazon or Netflix recommend products or movies, based on the behaviour of other customers who have bought the same products, or enjoyed the same films.

Internet dating may be big business, but no-one has yet devised the perfect matching system. It may well be that the secret of true love is simply not susceptible to big data or any other type of analysis.

""Two people may have exactly the same iTunes history,"" OKCupid's Christian Rudder concludes, ""but if one doesn't like the other's clothes or the way they look then there simply won't be any future in that relationship.""",Is big data dating the key to long-lasting romance?,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Paul Rubens]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/73630000/jpg/_73630860_177855786.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26613909
71,"Image copyright cheeky chops Image caption The Decorus Academy ballet school solved its late payment problem with a new payment processing app

The Decorus Academy ballet school in Bedfordshire has struggled with late paid invoices, just like many small businesses.

According to owner Laura Pendlebury, students would forget to bring their money in before the start of term and she'd have to spend weeks chasing them up.

""When you've outgoings like premises and heating, late payments can be a real problem,"" she says.

""If I had a receptionist to help me out, it might have been different, but that kind of overhead isn't feasible for me.""

Luckily help was at hand in the form of an app called Zapper Scan-to-Pay.

Through the system Laura attaches a specially created QR code to her invoices that contains payment information. Customers then scan the code using their smartphones, confirm the amount and pay in seconds.

""It's super-quick, much easier than logging into your bank,"" she says. ""Obviously some people don't have smartphones, but they're the minority.""

Monies owed

The ballet school says it's now fixed the late payment problem, but many others aren't so fortunate.

According to payment systems provider Sage Pay, nearly two-thirds of UK businesses experience late payments of 90 days or more, with invoices worth £55bn ($91.5bn; 66.5bn euros) remaining unpaid or outstanding.

Firms spend on average two weeks a year chasing them.

And in January, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) reported that more half of 8,000 surveyed members who provided goods or services to larger private sector businesses had been paid late in the previous 12 months.

""Late payment means reduced profitability, knock-on late payments to suppliers, and reduced business growth,"" an FSB spokesman said.

""Thousands of small firms even go bust each year purely because the cash flow dries up, not because there's anything wrong with the underlying business.""

The good news is that a host of new software platforms are helping to ameliorate the problem.

Take Basware and Tradeshift, for example, which enable companies to issue or pay invoices securely via the cloud.

Image copyright zapper Image caption Zapper's Scan-to-Pay system makes use of QR codes to help customers pay their bills

According to Andrew Jesse, vice-president of Basware UK, ""e-invoicing"" makes the process more transparent and reduces the time it takes to get paid.

""Often late payments are due to a breakdown in the invoicing process - for example the non-receipt of an invoice, not quoting a purchasing order, or an incorrect address,"" he says.

""But e-invoicing gives the supplier certainty, and if there are queries on the invoice, these can also be dealt with electronically.""

Faster payments

Invoicing isn't the only payment process being streamlined for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMEs).

Square, a credit card reader that connects simply to a smart device, is proving a boon for merchants who want to take payments on the hop.

Platforms such as PayPal now have app versions too, reducing a merchant's reliance on cash or card.

Image copyright Square Image caption Square's mobile card reading dongle helps small businesses accept payments on the move

And affordable cloud accounting programs, such as Wave and Xero, are simplifying tedious payroll and book-keeping tasks.

""Another interesting add-in is something like Receipt Bank that allows the business owner and employees to use a smartphone app to photograph and submit expense receipts on the go,"" says Simon Hammerschmidt, director of consulting for KPMG's national market practice.

The receipts are posted straight to your accounting system, ""ready for your accountant to see in your ledgers - no onerous transaction entries required"", he says.

Cash in the cloud

The advent of cloud computing has made such technology much more accessible to small businesses, he says. No longer do you have to go into the office to check the latest sales figures or submit expenses - these tasks can be performed anywhere with a laptop and a decent wi-fi signal.

The cloud has also brought down the cost. In the past, a small business would have to pay for software and hardware upfront and then incur costs maintaining them.

But with the cloud ""businesses can pay for what they need on a monthly basis without worrying about adding new storage or undertaking time-consuming upgrades,"" says Mr Hammerschmidt.

Despite the advances, some are still reluctant to dive in. According to Sage, 67% of small businesses say they prefer paper invoicing. One explanation may be the perceived complexity of technology, says Lee Perkins, managing director of the firm's small and start-up business division.

""Many small businesses believe that using [accounting] software requires prior knowledge in accounting or payroll and therefore that they might need to employ an expert to be able to use the software,"" he says.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Thousands of businesses go bust each year because of late payment of invoices, the FSB says

""For this reason, there's often a perception that it's easier and more time and cost effective to outsource to an accountant.""

'Worth a shot'

The FSB has called on local enterprise partnerships - between local authorities and businesses - to help, by providing more technology training and support for SMEs. It's also published best-practice guidelines on how to use technology.

It believes SMEs can learn a lot simply by observing what other businesses do. And for those fazed by the array of solutions out there, suppliers often offer free trials so you can try before you buy.

With payment bugbears likely to remain, it seems it's up to SMEs to find the solution that works for them. That may be daunting, but the pay-off is worth it, says Decorus Academy's Laura Pendlebury.

""I was spending so much time chasing small fees, I wasn't really focused on the business,"" she says.

""But now that I get most of my payments in before the start of term, it's a massive benefit. It was definitely worth a shot.""",Cash flow is king for tech savvy small businesses,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Daniel Thomas]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/73921000/jpg/_73921320_73790063.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26673698

Sophie Devonshire has her ""head in the clouds"", but she's not an unrealistic dreamer - far from it.

She runs her company virtually - there is no physical office and the staff all work remotely from their homes across the UK, Dubai and France.

In fact, Babes With Babies, Ms Devonshire's online retail company for new mothers and mums-to-be, has its feet firmly on the ground.

Business is booming and profitable - the company has enjoyed a sevenfold increase in turnover in the past seven years, she says.

Hers is one of a growing number of small businesses using remotely-accessed cloud technologies to keep overheads low and employee hours flexible, while selling to a potentially global market.

Digital water cooler

So how does a cloud-based business work in practice?

We use technology to make things more human and helpful Sophie Devonshire, Babes With Babies

Babes With Babies collaborates using Trello, an ""intuitive"" project management system, says Ms Devonshire.

""It's as if we're in a meeting room. You can set up noticeboards around topics. So, for example, if we're exploring the Autumn/Winter 2014 fashion collections, Zoe our chief buyer will enter her recommendations, then others will go in and add their thoughts,"" she says.

The constant use of Skype instant group messaging helps the team bond, she adds.

""It encourages team chat and provides those water cooler moments about the latest TV series or diet tips that are part of normal office life. We're a close team... like a family.""

Marketing is done via social media - the company has 7,000 Twitter followers - and via the company's website, where online payments are handled by Sage Pay and PayPal.

A weekly conference call and the use of cloud file-storage provider Dropbox - which can be accessed from anywhere in the world - complete the set of tools that make the virtual office function.

But physical goods still need to be despatched, however virtual your business.

The company outsources order handling and delivery to Intermail, which has a warehouse in Newbury, Berkshire. ""Once the customer places their order, the system talks to the fulfilment house which then talks back to the website with the tracking code,"" Ms Devonshire explains.

Using cloud-based systems and services is cost-efficient. You only pay for what you use, and you won't be bound by long contracts Lassi Virtanen, Pilvi.com

And there is still a role for face-to-face meetings in the cloud-based business, she says. Her company is planning a collaboration with international concierge company, Quintessentially, which offers meeting rooms.

Pie in the sky

But without a traditional, bricks-and-mortar presence, how does a cloud-based company build customer confidence? How does it persuade prospective clients that the company is a solid, reliable proposition, not a pie-in-the-sky entity that could disappear into thin air at any moment?

""It's all about an unremitting focus on customer service,"" says the 39-year-old entrepreneur.

The customer service team - or ""get-it-sorted girls"" as she describes them - are geographically spread so they can answer queries whatever the time of day or time zone, she says.

Her 11 members of staff all work flexible hours and this contributes to a highly motivated team who realise ""that the most important thing is to keep the customer happy,"" she maintains.

""The whole idea of Babes With Babies is to make new mums feel good,"" she says. ""So throughout the shopping process it's important that the customers feel looked after. We use technology to make things more human and helpful.""

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Small businesses can now buy a range of off-the-shelf cloud-based services and costs are coming down

Customer feedback about the website means it is ""constantly improving"", she adds. For example, customers from Australia have their VAT automatically deducted when they make a purchase.

One-stop-shop

The growing demand for cloud-based services has encouraged Finnish start-up, Pilvi.com, to launch a one-stop-shop where businesses can buy what they need from one marketplace.

Co-founder and chief operating officer, Lassi Virtanen, told the BBC: ""It can be hard for people to find what they need because the market is so fragmented. And managing multiple services can also easily become a burden with having to manage multiple invoices and learn a new user interface for each.""

His company aims to unify all these elements, he says.

""In general, using cloud-based systems and services is cost efficient. You only pay for what you use, and you won't be bound by long contracts.""

Such advantages mean global spending on IT cloud services is forecast to grow from $47.4bn (£28.5bn) in 2013 to $107.2bn by 2017, according to research company IDC.

Cloud philosophy

As well as enabling a low-cost, efficient virtual company structure, cloud services offer a new way of working, small business experts believe.

Chris Ward, author of Out of Office: Work Where You Like and Achieve More, says: ""Cloud-based systems offer a more productive and creative way to work.

""Generation Y has no intention whatsoever of sitting at the same desk for 40 hours of every single week. Those staying in their office all week will become as outdated as the landline and fax machine.""

Image copyright Trello Image caption Project management programs like Trello help cloud businesses co-ordinate their efforts

Shaa Wasmund, chief executive of small business advisory service, Smarta.com, told the BBC: ""Soon there'll be a new breed of entrepreneur who will just be doing what they love - serious about making money but also serious about having a life.

""They won't need to be based anywhere and won't be interested in sitting in meetings with venture capitalists.""

In Ms Devonshire's view, the culture of office presenteeism and long commutes do not get the best out of people, and she ""fundamentally"" disagrees with Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer, who has been outspoken against home working.

Borderless business

This cloud philosophy has seen Ms Devonshire's company survive not only the recession but also emigration.

Shortly after founding the company in 2006 she relocated from the UK to Estonia for a few years for her husband's job - with the couple's toddler and new baby in tow.

It could easily have been a crisis moment for the business.

""Among my friends there was a lot of doubt and general sucking of teeth, particularly those who worked for big corporations. It's been good to prove them wrong,"" she says.

She is now back in the UK, but the time abroad shaped the way Babes With Babies operates by establishing the right systems early on, she believes.

73,"Image copyright SAP Image caption Sensors are everywhere at TSG Hoffenheim - collecting data about the team's training sessions

Charles Reep was a retired RAF Wing Commander who loved football.

Specifically, Swindon Town. And it ached to see them losing - something the team made a habit of in the 1949/50 season.

So frustrated was Wing Cdr Reep with one particular performance, that for the second half he pulled out his notepad and started making notes on the players - their movements, their positions, the shape of their play. He identified small changes that he thought could help the team grab a few more goals.

He was decades ahead of his time.

Now, behind the biggest football teams in the world, lies a sophisticated system of data gathering, metrics and number-crunching. Success on the pitch - and on the balance sheet - is increasingly becoming about algorithms.

The richest 20 clubs in the world bring in combined revenues of 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn, £4.5bn), according to consultancy firm Deloitte. And increasingly, data is being seen as crucial to maximising that potential income by getting the most from football's prized investments - the players.

Hoof it!

Data and football have had a strained relationship over the years.

Back in the 1950s, Swindon didn't have much time for Wing Cdr Reep's approach. But west London side Brentford did.

Image copyright Prozone Image caption Prozone's software offers real-time match tracking, and is used by over 300 clubs worldwide

The club was facing a relegation battle. Wing Cdr Reep was taken on as an advisor - and with his counsel, the team turned their fortunes around and were safe from relegation at the close of the season.

A triumph, you would think - but his approach, despite the measurable success, drew considerable scorn.

His data suggested that most goals were scored from fewer than three direct passes, and he therefore recommended the widely-despised ""long-ball"" game.

In other words, the ugliest type of football imaginable. Hoof the ball forward, hope you get a lucky break, and poke it into the net.

""Unfortunately it kind of brought statistics and football into disrepute,"" says Chris Anderson, author of The Numbers Game, an analytical and historical look at the use of data in football.

""Because people pooh-poohed the idea of the long ball game in football and thought it responsible for the England team not doing nearly as well as they should have for all these years.""

Leg sensors

Wing Cdr Reep passed away in 2002. Were he alive today, he would likely be a welcome guest at German football club TSG Hoffenheim, where the ""big data"" revolution is changing everything about how they prepare for a match.

Through a partnership with SAP - which specialises in handling ""big data"" for business - the club has incorporated real-time data measurements into its training schedule.

""It's a very new way of training,"" says Stefan Lacher, head of technology at SAP.

Image copyright SAP Image caption The data can be analysed in real-time by data experts - and training schedules can be adapted

""The entire training area becomes accessible virtually by putting trackers on everything that's important - on the goals, on the posts. Every player gets several of them - one on each shinpad - and the ball of course has a sensor as well.

""If you train for just 10 minutes with 10 players and three balls - it produces more than seven million data points, which we can then process in real time.""

SAP's software is able to crunch that data, and suggest tweaks that each individual player can make.

""It's about better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the players,"" Mr Lacher says, ""and spending more time working on the weaknesses and making better use of the strengths.

""It's moving from gut feeling to facts and figures.""

Career-threatening injury

But it's in the boardroom where football data has an even more critical role to play in the success of the team, says Dr Paul Neilson from football technology specialists Prozone.

""One of the most important things within elite sport is making sure your players are available for training and matches as much as possible, and that is about mitigating injury risks,"" he says.

""If you're doing that you should be able to reduce the risk of physical overload, and reduce the risk of injury.

Image copyright SAP Image caption The data can be relayed to players so they can work on their weaknesses

""When you're paying players as much as players get paid, it's very important to make sure they're on the pitch as much as possible.""

Non-playing players is a massive financial concern for football clubs. The famous example is the case of Jonathan Woodgate, who left Newcastle United in 2004 to join Spanish giants Real Madrid - for a tasty £13.4m.

Plagued by injury, Woodgate played for Real just nine times before leaving in 2007. That's just under £1.5m per game - without his weekly wages taken into consideration.

Prozone's research lab wants to reduce this risk for clubs by using data to analyse body movements and spot, before a physio can, where future injuries may occur.

In young players, analysis of movement can also provide an early warning system for those who may develop career-threatening injuries.

Collecting this data is a sophisticated task. Prozone's approach relies on a complex network of cameras fitted around the stadium, picking up player movements from several angles at once.

Two worlds

Football managers and coaches like to think it's their instinct, not geeky data, that gets results. And so, uptake of data analysis in football has been a slow process.

""Football, particularly in the UK, can be a little bit conservative,"" says Dr Neilson.

""You look at rugby, and the head coach/manager will often be in the stand for all the game and be surrounded by data and technology and video analysis.

Image copyright SAP Image caption Players at Hoffenheim attach sensors to their kit to monitor their movements

""Compare that with football and the manager is still very much in the dugout, trying to affect the players personally, in terms of instructions and shouting - and very much being part of the sometimes chaotic nature of football.""

This culture clash means there are no managers that prowl the touchline with a tablet - yet. But behind the scenes it's a very different picture.

Prozone provides intricate data for more than 300 football clubs around the world, including every team in the lucrative English Premier League.

But to make sense of it all requires talent - and Dr Neilson believes that soon, fans will come to admire - or despise - their club's data scientist in the same way they treat the manager now.

""In a typical football club you have technical people like your sports analysis staff, or sports science staff. They are very analytical, very objective and process driven.

""At the opposite end of the scale you have the decision makers - the chief executive who writes the cheques, the manager that makes the weekly decision in terms of team selection.

""The challenge is connecting those two worlds - so the decision makers trust in that data.""

Sadly, Wing Cdr Reep didn't live to see the true appreciation of his craft.

And to this day, his long-ball philosophy is criticised by many who say that his data collection was far too primitive to come to such sweeping conclusions.

But nevertheless, his work pioneered what has become a cornerstone of the modern, beautiful game.

Somewhere, in the not-so-distant future, at a football club losing three-nil at home - the fans are chanting ""you're getting sacked in the morning"". Not at the manager, but at the man with the big data.

74,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption As Windows XP goes the way of the dinosaurs, what should small businesses be doing to evolve?

Millions of small businesses around the world who use Microsoft's ever-popular Windows XP are facing a tricky situation.

What should they do now that Microsoft has pulled the plug and ended technical support and security updates for the venerable operating system?

Should they face the expense and upheaval of upgrading to new systems, or stick to what they know and hope for the best?

Despite advance notice of the decision, the 13-year-old XP is still used on almost a third of all personal computers worldwide.

And many businesses have only recently, and grudgingly, begun to consider their options.

The UK government is so concerned it is paying Microsoft £5.5m to extend support for departmental computers using Windows XP, Office 2003 and Exchange 2003 for a further 12 months beyond the 8 April cut-off date.

'Put out'

Rosemayre Barry of London-based business, The Pet Chip Company, is one manager who is puzzled and more than a little annoyed that she has been faced with the XP dilemma.

""XP has been excellent,"" she says. ""I'm very put out. When you purchase a product you don't expect it to be discontinued, especially when it's one of [Microsoft's] most used products.""

Image copyright The Pet Chip Company Image caption The Pet Chip Company is one small firm unhappy at Microsoft withdrawing support for XP

But the code-base underpinning XP started to be outdated, Microsoft says.

""We live in a much more mobile world than 13 years ago; hardware has never been so cost-effective and computing requirements and capabilities have moved on beyond anyone's expectations,"" says Microsoft's UK Windows commercial chief, David Rodger.

Technology such as touchscreens on smartphones and tablets now take advantage of hardware, software, and processing power that wasn't around in 2001, he adds.

Hacking attacks

While there's nothing to stop businesses continuing with the operating system, Mark Brown, director of information security at auditing firm Ernst & Young, warns that doing so leaves them increasingly vulnerable to hacking.

If something goes wrong, you've got nowhere to go Rosemayre Barry, The Pet Chip Company

""Hackers will use Microsoft's move to cease support for XP as an opportunity to take advantage of organisations that haven't got their house in order,"" Mr Brown says.

While cyber security companies say they will continue to provide Windows XP updates for their antivirus and firewall software, this is unlikely to bridge the void left by the end of Microsoft support, they warn.

""The older the operating system the greater the security risks,"" says Mike Foreman, general manager for small business at computer security company AVG.

Trust in the cloud?

Some experts think that small businesses can use the end of XP support as a spur to move from a locally-stored software model to one involving web-based services.

There has certainly been plenty of hype around ""the cloud"" over the last year or so.

With devices such as Google's Chromebook coming on to the market, businesses can now operate completely online. In theory.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Microsoft founder Bill Gates launched Windows XP in October 2001

A firm could use web-based email, productivity and collaboration software from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Citrix, and back up all their data to a cloud storage provider such as Dropbox or Box.com.

But for some small businesses, this radical approach could be a step too far, because it makes them almost completely reliant on internet connectivity.

This can be patchy, particularly in rural areas.

Another potential concern is the reliability of the cloud service provider, so businesses need to keep their eyes wide open, IT consultant Adrian Mars argues.

We are living at a time when the potential to innovate and create has never been greater, and with the right technology, small businesses are well positioned to benefit David Rodger, Microsoft

When you entrust your data to a third party, you have to be comfortable with certain risks, he says. For example, online services may not always be available due to unforeseen problems with the service provider.

""If your data is backed up to the cloud, can you trust that your data won't get corrupted?""

Such concerns may convince many businesses to stick with locally stored business productivity software, such as Office, Microsoft's suite that includes programs like Word and Excel, rather than Office 365, the web-based version of the product.

They could then use their own local data back-ups, he says.

Along with its withdrawal of support for Windows XP, Microsoft has also ceased support for Office 2003.

The legacy headache

The option of sticking with XP after the 8 April shut-off date was not a risk that Rosemayre Barry wanted to take.

Without Microsoft support ""if something goes wrong, you've got nowhere to go,"" she says.

She considered transferring her company's IT infrastructure over to Apple, but Macs weren't a good fit, she says.

""If I'd had more time and money I'd have gone with Apple. I just did not want to put the company though all that extra expense.""

Image copyright ubuntu Image caption Open-source operating systems like Ubuntu offer an alternative to Windows

Apple computers are very powerful and well built, but can be three times the price of Windows PCs, says Andy Buss, a European consulting manager for IT analyst group IDC.

""There are plenty of PCs around at low cost that are capable of running Windows 7 or Windows 8,"" Mr Buss says. ""My advice is to upgrade to Windows 8.""

The Pet Chip Company went with the industry consensus, and opted to upgrade to Windows 8.1, which costs between £100-to-£190 per package, depending on the version.

She also replaced the company's three PCs as well as the software.

""When you are a company you don't have the luxury of looking around,"" says Ms Berry. ""I wanted to get it sorted out as quickly as I could.""

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Rosemayre Barry's firm upgraded to Windows 8.1

What other alternatives are there?

Small businesses could switch to an open-source Linux-based operating system, such as Ubuntu, Red Hat or Suse, advises Mr Buss.

But they have a very different look and feel to Windows and would take a deal of getting used to, he believes.

Biting the bullet

Unsurprisingly, Microsoft maintains companies will be better off without XP - they get to sell millions of pounds worth of new software after all.

Setting up a business in 2013 was almost ""comically easy"" compared with when he started out in 1989, says video games entrepreneur Martin Kenwright.

With two multimillion-pound games companies - Digital Image Design and Evolution - under his belt, he is hoping his third enterprise, Starship, will achieve even greater things.

One key difference between then and now is the sophistication of the technologies on offer, he says, which are enabling start-ups in all sectors to punch above their weight and go global far faster than they ever could before.

""When I started doing graphics for video games, I would draw everything using pencil on graph paper, then input the co-ordinates manually into the computer,"" the Liverpudlian boss, responsible for best-selling 3D games such as Motorstorm and World Rally Championship, told the BBC.

""The biggest technological breakthrough for designers was the invention of the mouse,"" he says.

Agile business

Image copyright Matt Wall Image caption Starship boss Martin Kenwright chose his new company's name to reflect his ambitions

Scroll forward to the modern era of high-speed internet, cloud-based services and hugely powerful computers, and it's clear the world has changed radically.

Now Mr Kenwight's developers have a range of off-the-shelf tools at their fingertips, from game design engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, to 3D digital art packages, such as Photoshop, Maya and ZBrush.

""What used to take me three days on paper I now do in three minutes,"" says the 46-year-old ""scally from Netherley"".

But the biggest, and most advantageous, change he has seen over the past 35 years is the easy access to developer talent that can be bought in ad hoc according to the specific needs of the project.

""Keeping overheads down means you can take more risks - you can be more agile,"" he says.

'Gamification'

Starship's 20-plus staff communicate and collaborate using a range of technologies, such as Skype and FaceTime, and the company aims to be paper-free and cloud-based.

During the Games Developer Conference in San Francisco last month, the team synchronised their iPad presentations in real time to prospective partners and publishers using Keynote collaboration software.

But while off-the-shelf tools and the move towards online streaming have led to a ""democratisation"" of the sector, they have also contributed to a homogeneity in the games on offer, Mr Kenwright argues.

""All the technology in the world can't replace a good idea,"" he says, brandishing his ring-binder pad in which all his ideas are written down.

Starship plans to inject ""gamification"" technology to other ""trillion-dollar"" sectors, such as retail and health, but with products under development for a summer launch, Mr Kenwright remained steadfastly tight-lipped on the details.

""We're building software for hardware that hasn't even been invented yet,"" he said cryptically.

Utility computing

The real digital revolution has only just begun Martin Kenwright, Starship

For CloudSense, a cloud services company with an annual turnover of £10m and offices in Zagreb, Pune, New York, Leeds and London, the big technology breakthrough was the advent of ""platform-as-a-service"" (PaaS).

""When the four of us started in 2009. we just had a bunch of ideas, but instead of building everything from scratch, we were able to piggyback on Salesforce.com's existing platform,"" says co-founder and chief executive Richard Britton.

""This gave us access to servers, software and developer tools that helped us turn our ideas into products quickly, all for a monthly fee of about £80.""

This kind of ""utility computing model"", now also offered by the likes of Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine and Red Hat Openshift, ""allows small businesses to cling to the coat-tails of big business and market to a global audience,"" says Mr Britton.

Image copyright cloudsense Image caption CloudSense boss Richard Britton says his company was able to grow fast thanks to cloud technology

""It levels the playing field and allows us to concentrate on research and development rather than worrying about IT infrastructure.""

It is also far easier to market products via platforms such as Salesforce's AppExchange and Apple's App Store, he argues, while recruiting talent for specific projects can be done via freelancer networks, such as oDesk and Elancer.

Physical presence

Software and platform services have drastically reduced the costs of setting up a business Liam Collins, Nesta

CloudSense, which helps telecoms, media and utility companies manage their customer subscriptions and cross-sell other products, now employs about 130 people worldwide.

Ironically, given the virtual nature of CloudSense's products, physical offices are still important, Mr Britton believes, because ""global brands still don't trust cloud companies completely. A physical presence is comforting for them.""

This is a point echoed by Gary Turner, managing director of small business accounting software company Xero.

""We didn't have a physical location for the first four years of the company's life,"" he says. ""I worked from my spare room for the first two-and-a-half years after joining in 2009.""

But as the IT services company grew fast - it now has 700 staff worldwide - it found that ""larger groups need physical collaboration. We found a real boost in creativity when we started setting up offices,"" he says.

Start-up renaissance

Liam Collins, senior researcher at innovation charity Nesta, says: ""Software and platform services have drastically reduced the costs of setting up a business.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Smartphone apps are giving small companies greater reach

""And online marketplaces have made it easier to get goods and services to an international market, which is particularly important for developing economies.""

Research from enterprise campaign StartUp Britain shows that 526,446 new businesses were registered in 2013, compared with 484,224 in 2012.

While this increase can partly be explained by the recovering global economy, it is also a testament to the enabling power of technology, Mr Collins says.

Mr Kenwright concludes: ""I was never going to return to the industry to do something that people expected. We're aiming to disrupt the market with revolutionary products that fulfil a genuine use and need for consumers.

The recent security scare over the Heartbleed bug should send shivers down the spines of most small businesses.

There you are thinking all your online customer data is safe, thanks to popular open-source encryption software called OpenSSL, and it turns out to be anything but.

This small vulnerability has potentially compromised two-thirds of all websites.

""The main worry is for small e-commerce sites that do not know they have been affected,"" says Keith Cottenden, director at cybersecurity specialists CY4OR.

""Any business that takes customer details could be vulnerable because this encryption is designed to protect personal data… Businesses need to apply mitigation now.""

But finding effective and affordable ways to keep ""mission critical"" data safe from hackers, fraudsters and natural disasters can be a daunting and difficult task for small firms.

Busted flush

Poor data security can literally ruin your business.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption MtGox's shutdown prompted anger among bitcoin traders

For example, weak security measures and alleged poor infrastructure brought Japanese Bitcoin exchange MtGox to its knees before it eventually went bust.

The exchange, which was handling about 70% of the world's bitcoin trades at its height, said 850,000 of the digital currency coins were stolen by hackers.

The company was forced to file for bankruptcy in February.

But in March, MtGox then said it had found 200,000 ""lost"" bitcoins - worth about £70m - in an old digital wallet dating from 2011.

When security is your business, such laxity is obviously disastrous.

The UK's Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) believes unchecked cybercrime is severely stunting the growth potential of its members.

The risk of fraud and online crime, both real and perceived, is costing each UK small business up to £4,000 per year, the FSB says, while cybercrime as a whole costs the UK economy an estimated £27bn a year.

About a third of FSB members have been victims of online crime over the last year, whether from virus infections, hacking attacks or other system security breaches.

As well as the financial loss and inconvenience, there is the potentially disastrous loss of customer trust.

Crime and complacency

Despite the critical importance of data security, many businesses appear almost oblivious to the risks.

A 2013 survey by security software firm AVG revealed that a large amount of data loss occurs simply due to human error and carelessness.

It seems many businesses are more concerned with tidying their desks or ordering new business cards than backing up data.

A reported 43% of UK and 53% of US small businesses said they spend more time changing passwords than backing up.

And about a quarter of them leave longer than a week between back-ups.

""Too many times an act of carelessness or a security breach has led to information going missing, and in some cases businesses have found themselves in a position where the data is non-recoverable,"" a Microsoft spokesman told the BBC.

Floods and fires

Natural disasters can pose just as big a risk to small firms as cybercrime.

An estimated 25% of businesses do not reopen following a major disaster, according to the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a not-for-profit organisation.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed thousands of small businesses in the US, while many others still felt the effects at least a year after the event.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc along the East Coast of the US

Rob Cotton, chief executive of Manchester-based NCC Group, a data security firm, told the BBC that adapting good security practices can be difficult for small businesses.

""SMEs that are using their own IT services in-house need to consider the physical security of the equipment, as well as whether the IT is vulnerable to external threats,"" he says.

""It's also important to consider the risk from your own staff, since many incidents result from rogue employees - the so-called 'insider threat'.""

Cloud all hot air?

Putting business-critical information in the hands of a third party demands a degree of trust Microsoft spokeman

A common piece of advice is to back up data securely and often, but should this be to locally stored servers or to remote cloud services?

""Cloud providers will generally be more proactive in terms of ensuring software is up-to-date and maintaining patch levels,"" says Mr Cotton.

""They will also have better security knowledge and awareness, meaning servers and services will generally be well configured. On top of this they are more resilient and most will have robust disaster recovery and continuity plans in place.""

Another advantage of the cloud is that thieves won't necessarily know which service your business uses or where it keeps its servers.

But Mr Cotton admits there are certainly risks around adopting cloud services.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Using cloud services has several advantages but is no guarantee of keeping your data safe

One obvious one - often overlooked - is that the provider itself suffers a break in service or a breach of its defences, so it makes sense to interrogate the reputation and reliability of any cloud service provider very closely.

""Putting business-critical information in the hands of a third party demands a degree of trust,"" said a Microsoft spokesman. ""Solid providers will explain their security methodologies and commitment to the business.""

That said, a ""belt-and-braces"" local back-up plan may be a good idea.

Spread your eggs

Small firms need to protect their data against viruses, malware and natural disasters, as well as disgruntled or careless employees.

But how defences against these threats are implemented will depend upon the circumstances and nature of each business, experts say.

In finance, keeping all your eggs in one basket is rarely a wise idea, and the same applies to data. So for maximum security, spreading data around both traditional and non-traditional services seems to be the best policy.

Perhaps most importantly, the FSB stresses the need for education.

If your managers and employees don't appreciate the need to protect data, the whole future of your business could be on the line.",Big risks for small businesses who ignore data security,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Nicholas Tufnell]",https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74296000/jpg/_74296285_021857181-1.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27052250
77,"Image copyright MEDIATONIC Image caption Dave Bailey, boss of games maker Mediatonic, says big data is ""fundamental to his business""

New Microsoft boss Satya Nadella reckons the ""data dividend"" could be worth $1.6 trillion (£950bn; 1.2tn euros) to big business over the next four years.

But what about the little guys?

Is big data - and all the useful insights we can glean from analysing this growing plethora of digital information - solely the preserve of big business?

Far from it, comes the resounding answer from a chorus of experts.

Big data, and the analytical techniques associated with it, could help give your small business the tools it needs to grow rapidly and even go global, they say.

And turning all this data into understandable, useful applications is becoming a business opportunity in itself.

For sole traders it's not realistic to expect big data to apply to them directly, but they can access services that rely on big data analytics Andrew Jennings, FICO

""Big data analytics is absolutely relevant to small businesses,"" says Dave Coplin, Microsoft's chief envisioning officer. ""There's a growing number of open data sets out there that could be useful, as well as data marketplaces small businesses can go to.""

Real time analytics

Dave Bailey, chief executive of fast-growing digital games company Mediatonic, says big data is ""fundamental to our business and really important for many small-to-medium sized companies. It directs our strategy.""

As Mediatonic's games, such as Disney's Superbia, are digital only, players are constantly generating vast amounts of user data, says Mr Bailey, such as when, where and how long they play, and which parts of the game they find especially hard or easy.

Understanding game player behaviour is crucial in an industry that has moved primarily to a free download model, where revenues come mostly from in-game purchases and half of players never return, he says.

Image copyright MEDIATONIC Image caption Dave Bailey, boss of games maker Mediatonic, says big data is ""fundamental to his business""

""We can test different versions of a game on different demographics at the same time,"" he says, ""and tweak them in response to the real-time data we receive. We can now understand each individual player.""

The fact that storing large amounts of data has become ""quite inexpensive"" for small businesses certainly helps, he says.

Global reach

In another example, French online advertising company, Criteo, grew very quickly on the back of big data analytics.

By tracking customer journeys across the web they learned how to serve personalised adverts tailored to the interests of the user based on their previous surfing behaviour.

The adverts can be changed in real time according to who is visiting the site, so two different people will see different content.

Image copyright criteo Image caption Criteo tailors its adverts for whoever is browsing at the time

Digital data was its currency and understanding and managing it core to business success, says vice president of engineering, Julien Simon.

The company, which uses MongoDB for its main database, now serves 2.5 billion banner ads daily, works with 5,000 advertisers worldwide, and has to store an extra 20 terabytes of data each day as a result.

Accessible?

But many small businesses won't be in a sector that generates large amounts of digital data, so how is any of this relevant to them?

We live in a data society. No business of any size can afford to ignore it Jed Mole, Acxiom

Andrew Jennings, chief data analytics officer at San Jose-based FICO, a global data analytics company, admits: ""For sole traders it's not realistic to expect big data to apply to them directly, but they can access services that rely on big data analytics, such as maps and weather forecasts.""

In a mobile world populated by apps, businesses will be able to plug in to the power of big data analytics through their phones, believes Jonathan Gray, chief executive of app development platform, Continuuity.com.

His company is helping app developers build and integrate their apps with big data management systems like Hadoop, thereby enabling users to analyse live data streams in real time.

""A lot of small businesses are not going to have their own developers, so our belief is that the value is in the apps not the infrastructure,"" says Mr Gray.

""We aim to become the platform businesses come to in order to buy big data applications in the cloud.""

Practical uses of big data analytics could include a local retailer selling brollies and barbecues being able to access weather forecast data, current consumer sentiment on social media, and customer location as tracked by mobile phones.

Image copyright AFP Image caption In need of a brolly? Accessible weather forecast data could help retailers target their sales

The retailer would gain valuable insight into how much stock to buy in and how to promote its business, suggests Matt Asay, MongoDB's vice president of business strategy.

""Admittedly, small businesses won't have access to the same store of customer data as Amazon, but there are lots of public data sets out there that could be useful,"" he says.

In another example, taxi firms could make use of rail and air transport delay data to plan where to concentrate their vehicles and when to deploy them, he says.

Continuuity's Jonathan Gray envisages farmers plugging in to big data capabilities on their phones and mobile soil analysis readers, accessing huge data sets on weather, soil types, optimum sowing times and crop yields, for example.

Data-driven business

You have to be prepared to pivot and follow where the data - and the money - takes you Duncan Ross, Teradata

Even if a fledgling business has a small customer database, it is still important to think in big data terms, argues Jed Mole, European marketing director for Acxiom, a big data specialist.

""We live in a data society,"" he says. ""No business of any size can afford to ignore it.""

He believes big data ""is an enabler for small business to become the big business of tomorrow"".

Mr Asay agrees, saying: ""These days all businesses, whether small or large, have to keep track of their customer data and metadata so they can respond quickly to what their customers are doing and push messages to them.

""The need to deal with modern, messy data exists whether you're building an app for 20 people or 20,000 people,"" he adds.

Companies such as Flurry and Crittercism offer app data analysis, while BearingPoint's HyperCube offers to turn raw data into useful insight businesses can act on.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Social media could provide a wealth of data for small firms

And the most obvious relevant source of big data for small businesses is social media, whether as a communications tool or a way to gain consumer insight.

A growing number of companies, such as Datasift, mBlast and SecondSync, specialise in turning the social media data ""hosepipe"" into useful intelligence for businesses of all sizes.

Size isn't everything

The good news for small businesses thinking that this data dividend does not apply to them is that they ""have a much greater ability to innovate than big companies,"" believes Duncan Ross, director of data science at analytics company Teradata.

""Big data presents many business opportunities,"" he says. ""But you have to be prepared to pivot and follow where the data - and the money - takes you.""

FICO's Andrew Jennings concurs, saying: ""When it comes to big data there's a fixation on the word 'big', when it's really not the size that matters but how well you use the data.""",Can small firms benefit from the big data dividend?,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Bbc News, Matthew Wall]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74297000/jpg/_74297999_david_bailey_dsc_1500.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27065762
78,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Many small firms around the world still experience snail's pace internet connectivity

High-speed internet - or the lack of it - has become a global economic issue.

A 10% increase in fast broadband penetration can result in between 0.25% and 1.38% growth in a country's gross domestic product (GDP), research by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) suggests, as well as a 3.6% increase in efficiency.

Yet even some developed economies are struggling to provide widespread high-speed connectivity across all areas.

For example, poor broadband coverage in many parts of the UK is leaving small businesses hamstrung, constraining their export potential, and hampering economic growth, says the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).

'Frankly baffled'

Andrew Charteris, project manager of Buckinghamshire-based Hamble Interiors, an interior design company employing three people, told the BBC: ""It is frustrating when you can't upload and view a drawing during a meeting. Our international clients are frankly baffled - they can't believe it.""

He often needs to send architectural plans to clients in the Middle East, but the internet connection is just not fast or reliable enough to run his business properly, he maintains. The speed drops significantly in the afternoons when children come home from school and start playing and working online, he says.

His business is based in the village of Hambleden, where a company called Village Networks provides a radio-based broadband service using masts connected to villagers' roofs.

Image copyright Villagenetworks Image caption Village Networks offers radio-based wi-fi to rural Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire

The masts beam the radio signal from house to house and provide a standard broadband service of up to 6 megabits per second (Mbps) to local businesses.

But this, and other options, such as 3G or 4G cellular services and satellite broadband, can be expensive, slow, patchy and unreliable.

'Slowspots'

And it's not just rural areas, which telecoms providers say are more expensive and difficult to service, that are suffering from high-speed internet ""notspots"" or ""slowspots"".

""People can't work from home because it takes too long to access files on our server,"" says Mick Stallwood, managing director of Design and Automation Solutions, an engineering design consultancy based less than 35 miles from London.

Slow broadband speeds well below 2Mbps are preventing him from taking on more staff working from home, and from opening another office in Australia, he says.

Image copyright design & automation solutions Image caption Design & Automation Solutions says its complex digital drawings take too long to access online

The company works with large computer aided design, or CAD, files which are often 50 megabytes (MB) or larger in size.

So what is the UK government doing about it?

'Superfast coverage'

Its national Broadband Delivery UK scheme aims to provide universal access to broadband services of up to 2Mbps by 2017.

But Mike Cherry, the FSB's policy chairman, believes that this level of service is wholly inadequate.

""The idea that 2Mbps by 2017 is sufficient for businesses is not the greatest of thinking by the government - it is nowhere near enough,"" he says.

""Without broadband you won't get the same levels of growth, and efficiency inevitably suffers.""

Average internet connection speeds Country Speed (Mbps) Global 3.8 South Korea 21.9 Japan 12.8 Netherlands 12.4 Hong Kong 12.2 Switzerland 12.0 Czech Republic 11.4 Sweden 10.5 Latvia 10.4 Ireland 10.4 United States 10.0 Akamai State of the Internet Q4 2013

Earlier this month, Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, announced that the average download speeds for residential fixed-line broadband connections rose by 21% to 17.8Mbps between May and November 2013, prompting communications minister Ed Vaizey to say that ""the UK has the best superfast coverage of all five leading European economies.""

But access to such speeds is far from evenly spread, particularly for businesses, and Britain still lags behind many other countries.

According to the latest State of the Internet report carried out by global web content network provider Akamai, Britain ranks sixth in the EMEA - Europe, Middle East and Africa - region (11th worldwide) for fast broadband availability above 10Mbps, and eighth in EMEA (14th worldwide) for average speed broadband availability of above 4Mbps.

""If we want to go for the high levels of exports that the government is encouraging, then we need to be leaders in broadband provision,"" says Mr Cherry.

""But we are streets behind countries like Singapore and South Korea. Just being middle of the road is not good enough.""

Mawingu white spaces

So how do other countries cope?

In places like the Netherlands or Singapore that have dense urban populations it is much cheaper to provide fast broadband coverage for everyone than in less developed countries with more geographically widespread rural populations.

But a number of innovative approaches are being developed to bring fast broadband to people in some of these countries.

For example, Microsoft's 4Afrika Mawingu initiative is exploring the use of unused television broadcast bands - known as TV white spaces - to transmit internet signals to rural communities in Kenya as an alternative to 3G mobile internet.

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Kenyan villagers can now enjoy wi-fi connectivity at faster speeds than many UK small firms

Frank McCosker, general manager for affordable access at Microsoft 4Afrika, says the technology has a range of 13km (eight miles) from a transmitter base station; can offer broadband connections of up to 16Mbps and costs 15% of the equivalent 3G infrastructure.

""We are trying to connect the unconnected and make it affordable,"" he explains.

4Afrika is installing low energy base stations in health centres and schools offering free internet access, and these are powered by solar panels, which also provide charging facilities for mobile phones and other internet devices.

Agents are also using the technology to set up internet cafes in old shipping containers equipped with masts and solar panels in Kenya's Rift Valley. These are mainly used by local farmers to access weather forecasts, learn new growing techniques, and get the latest prices for seeds and crops, Mr McCosker adds.

Companies including Facebook and Google are also investigating the possibility of providing wireless broadband internet connections via solar-powered drones.

Earlier this year, Facebook bought UK-based drone maker Ascenta for $20m (£12m). And this month Google bought US high-altitude drone maker Titan Aerospace for an undisclosed sum.

Titan's drones can fly for years using solar power, and the company says it expects initial commercial operations by 2015.

Sustainability means many things to many people, but it boils down to this: saving Planet Earth.

Mankind, as a species, has been too successful for its own good - the global population is forecast to top nine billion by 2050, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

As a result, there is already a strain on the planet's essential natural resources, particularly food and water, which population growth can only exacerbate.

Meanwhile, our demand for energy - and the life enhancing technologies it powers - has led to the plundering of the earth's hydrocarbons oil, gas and coal, ultimately leading to potentially catastrophic climate change.

Image copyright BITC Global megatrends are markedly affecting the business environment Emma Price-Thomas, Business in the Community

Business imperatives

Most companies are already being affected by climate change today, directly or indirectly, says CDP, a global not-for-profit organisation specialising in measuring business environmental impact.

Extreme weather, drought and flooding can disrupt production capacity and affect supply chains for a whole range of businesses.

For example, in a CDP survey of 70 European companies, 83% said they had operations in ""water-stressed"" regions, while 73% said water shortages posed risks to their own operations or those of their suppliers.

""Many businesses rely on basic natural resources like water to make their products,"" says Zoe Arden, director at think tank SustainAbility. ""But it's a depleting resource. The water table in China is plummeting alarmingly and large areas of the country are in drought situations.""

In an increasingly globalised economy, few businesses can isolate themselves from the impacts of climate change, population growth and resource depletion, says Emma Price-Thomas, head of sustainability strategy at charity Business in the Community.

""The world is changing very fast. Global megatrends are markedly affecting the business environment. If firms don't address these and think longer-term, they may end up putting themselves out of business,"" she argues.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Will genetically modified crops have a place in a more sustainable future?

A lot of technology and research is being directed towards reducing water usage in industrial processes and designing products that need less water to work, she says.

Fish fingers

For companies with long supply chains, like supermarkets, the challenge comes down to: ""How can we make sure there are enough fish in the sea so we can make our fish fingers?"" says Mike Peirce, director of strategy and communications at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL).

Businesses need to adapt to changing consumer demand and become more efficient if they are to survive ""the severe challenges"" coming their way, he argues.

Justin Keeble, managing director of consultancy Accenture's sustainability services division, agrees: ""The business imperative is about mitigating risk and making your business more resilient against resource scarcity and energy insecurity.""

Sustainable value

But a persistent problem for many businesses has been putting a value on ""going green"" and justifying the expense of investing in new technologies.

A major survey of 1,000 global chief executives by United Nations Global Compact and Accenture found that nearly two-fifths of bosses thought that the failure to link sustainability with business value was hampering progress.

This is despite the fact that the vast majority understood its importance and the new business opportunities it presented, the survey suggested.

But Accenture's Mr Keeble argues: ""It is possible to put numbers on the risks and opportunities associated with sustainability.

""We estimate that UK business could make £100bn [$169bn; 122bn euros] in productivity savings and that there is a £200bn opportunity for businesses offering sustainable products.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Water shortages are an increasing problem for businesses around the world

Retailer Marks and Spencer has achieved net savings of £135m through its Plan A sustainability programme, he points out.

'Sharing economy'

So what technologies will be key to helping businesses around the world address the sustainability agenda?

""Mobile is having a profound impact,"" says Mr Keeble. ""It is enabling data transparency and giving far more information to consumers who are beginning to think about the provenance of materials and products a lot more.

""This, in turn, is encouraging businesses to believe it is worthwhile developing more sustainable products.""

Mobile is also facilitating ""the sharing economy"", says Ms Price-Thomas, citing car sharing company Zipcar and flat sharing firm Aribnb as examples.

By some estimates, sharing just one car takes another 20 off the road, with the reduction in CO2 emissions that entails.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Car sharing schemes like Zipcar could help drastically reduce carbon emissions

And DIY retailer B&Q's Streetclub concept is encouraging local communities to co-operate and share more, to make better use of existing assets rather than wastefully buying new ones.

""Why does everyone need to buy an electric hand drill when the average use is about six minutes?"" asks Mr Keeble. ""An embedded SIM card would allow people to use it on a pay-per-use basis.""

Smart energy

A big contributor to climate change and resource depletion is transport.

It accounts for about 35%-to-40% of global total energy end use, says Dr Simon Harrison, vice president at the Institution of Engineering and Technology. Heating accounts for a similar percentage.

While switching to lower carbon-producing electricity generation - wind, solar, hydro and nuclear - is important, ""using less energy is actually the best way of reducing CO2 emissions,"" he says.

The switch to more efficient petrol and diesel car engines, as well as the move towards electric vehicles, should make a big difference, Dr Harrison believes.

But unless we approach the whole topic of energy in a holistic way - applying smarter technologies to generation, transmission, storage and end usage - sustainable goals will not be reached, he warns.

Internet of things

The growing number of devices generating digital data - known as the internet of things - coupled with greater computer power to analyse this explosion of data - is another crucial element helping companies and people operate more sustainably.

""By employing sensors and harnessing big data analytics we can drive 20%-to-30% of energy usage out of buildings simply by optimising how air conditioning and heating systems are being operated,"" says Mr Keeble.

80,"Image copyright PA Image caption Construction output has expanded for the 12th month in a row

The UK's construction sector grew for the 12th month in a row in April, but at the slowest rate in six months, a survey has indicated.

The Markit construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 60.8 in April from 62.5 in March.

But the index has now been above the 50 threshold, which indicates growth, for a full year.

Residential housebuilding was the best-performing sub-sector again last month.

Markit said construction companies continued to take on staff at a strong pace, although the rate of hiring eased back slightly from the previous month.

Civil engineering activity slowed sharply, with some firms reporting an easing in the amount of business coming from flood relief work earlier in the year, Markit said.

The construction index comes a day after a survey of the manufacturing sector, which showed an influx of orders helped manufacturing activity grow last month at a much faster rate than expected.

Markit will publish its index for the the UK's dominant services sector on Monday.

Last week, official figures showed the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the three months to the end of March.

'Well positioned'

The construction industry, which accounts for just over 6% of the economy, has been recovering in the past year as government schemes to help people get onto the property ladder, such as Help to Buy, have boosted demand for new homes.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said while construction industry growth eased in April, the growth figure was still ""very strong"" adding the sector looked ""well positioned for much improved expansion in the second quarter"".

He added: ""Improving house building is particularly welcome news given that a shortage of properties is a major factor repeatedly putting upward pressure on UK house prices.

""Nevertheless, the fact remains that there needs to be extended, very strong house building to make significant inroads into the problem.""",Housebuilding boosts UK construction sector again in April,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74598000/jpg/_74598763_oomxmhkm.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27251552

Some drivers eat, others read, one even appears to be asleep.

Stranger still, only the driver of the lorry in front has his hands on his steering wheel. The other drivers appear to be driving ""hands free"".

This may sound like a scene from a sci-fi film, but is actually ""platooning"" - a technology being tested to make long-distance lorry driving more fuel-efficient and less polluting.

Using wireless technology, the lead truck, operated by a trained driver, controls the convoy behind it. When he brakes, the other lorries brake automatically; when he steers, they steer, too.

Radar-based ""adaptive cruise control"" ensures all trucks are travelling at a consistently safe distance from each other.

As the vehicles shelter behind each other in the ""road train"", aerodynamic drag resistance is reduced leading to 15% fuel savings, advocates of the technology say.

""Platooning is definitely something we will be seeing on our roads in future,"" says Carl Johan Almqvist, traffic and product safety director for Volvo Trucks, a firm that has successfully tested the technology.

Green technologies come with an upfront investment, but very often also with a very strong payback Jacob Sterling, Maersk Line

""There may be challenges in terms of public acceptance and legislation, but these will be conquered as the potential in fuel savings is very interesting.""

Green freight?

Platooning is just one of many technologies being used to tackle freight transport emissions, which contribute a large and growing proportion of all transport pollution, whether by land, air or sea.

Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) alone accounted for 19% of UK transport emissions in 1999-2010, and vans a further 12%, according to the Department for Transport.

And transport generally accounts for about 35% to 40% of global total energy end use.

US logistics giant UPS has 3,000 alternative fuel vehicles globally, but is also piloting electrically assisted cycles for package delivery.

It also uses package routing technology to minimise kilometres driven, and telematics - the onboard monitoring of driver behaviour - to tackle fuel inefficient idling and stop-start driving.

Image copyright ups Image caption Delivery company UPS has been experimenting with a range of ""greener"" vehicles

Telematics and other technologies helped reduce idling time by 254 million minutes in 2013, UPS claims, equivalent to 17,000 metric tonnes of CO2.

Similarly, British competitor TNT is rolling out in-cab camera systems that film the road ahead, capturing bad driving ""events"".

""[These are] tracked against GPS data, overlaid on a Google map and reviewed by depot management on a one-to-one basis with the driver,"" a TNT spokesman told the BBC. ""Any improvement actions are then agreed.""

Speeding bullet?

Some prefer a more flamboyant approach to lowering emissions.

Robert Sliwa, of Connecticut's AirFlow Truck Company, has created the Bullet Truck, which was inspired by the design of Japanese high-speed bullet trains.

The truck has a highly contoured, cone-shaped cab, and panels that stretch the length of its trailer, all of which reduce drag. Electrically powered air conditioning and power steering take a load off the diesel engine, too.

Image copyright Airflow Image caption The AirFlow Bullet Truck's aerodynamic design doubles fuel efficiency compared with traditional trucks

In 2012, it managed to cross the US with a full load averaging 13.4 miles per gallon (mpg) - more than twice the 6mpg ordinary trucks average.

Mr Sliwa, a former trucker and drag car racer, says he's now designing an even more streamlined ""concept vehicle"" for 2015, which will shield much of the truck's trailer and its rear wheels from the wind.

""People have been thinking I am crazy for many, many years,"" he says of the original bullet design. ""And yes, everyone figured I would never get it finished and it would not work.""

Sailing at a clip

Shipping is another important, yet polluting, component of freight transportation, accounting for 3% of the world's greenhouse gases, according to the European Commission.

That's around a billion tonnes of emissions a year, twice the carbon footprint of aviation.

Maersk Line, the largest container shipping company in the world, has recently launched its Triple E ship as an answer to the sustainability challenge.

It claims the vessel is 50% more energy efficient than the average container ship plying the waters between Asia and Europe.

Ironically, the Triple E carries 16% more cargo than the firm's next most fuel-efficient ship, but its engines are 20% smaller, meaning a slower, but more fuel-efficient journey.

Image copyright LADE AS Image caption Is the Vindskip the future shape of container ships?

A waste-heat recovery system transforms hot exhaust gas from the engine into extra energy for propulsion, too.

While some firms, like B9 Shipping and Cargill, have been experimenting with sails attached to the decks of cargo ships to make the most of following winds, Jacob Sterling, head of sustainability at Maersk, says these ""won't be a solution for container shipping in the foreseeable future - among other things because we need the deck space to stack containers.""

However, Norwegian designer Terje Lade reckons he may have found a way around that problem.

His Vindskip vessel, which is being developed by his firm Lade AS, could be 60% more fuel efficient than traditional ships, thanks to a radical design quirk - a hull shaped like a ""symmetrical air foil"".

The ship would be part-propelled by wind, backed up by liquefied natural gas-powered engines. On-board computers would calculate the ship's optimal route based on weather data, too.

""By developing navigation algorithms which can give you the optimum wind angle for maximum effect of the design, you can find the best route across the ocean, either most economically or by estimated time of arrival,"" he says.

The firm believes the ship could be ready for launch by 2018.

Cost benefit analysis

While environmentalists may welcome visionary new designs, some are sceptical about the prohibitive cost of such state-of-the-art technologies.

Image copyright Maersk line Image caption Maersk's EEE-Class cargo ship will use 50% less fuel thanks to smaller engines and slower speeds

Dr Andrew Traill of Green Freight Europe, a non-governmental organisation, warns that ""one or two ships might be built perhaps, but very often these innovative designs seldom get adopted on any large scale"".

But he accepts that the biggest incentive for any logistics firm to take up energy-saving technology is commercial - customers want cheaper deliveries.

For Maersk Line, fuel makes up about 20% of the firm's total costs, so the logic behind investment in green technology is compelling.

""Green technologies come with an upfront investment, but very often also with a very strong payback,"" says Mr Sterling.

""Last year, we saved $764m through energy efficiency improvements, roughly half our 2013 profit of $1.5bn,"" he said.

Electricity costs have doubled for businesses over the last decade, says energy saving body the Carbon Trust, pushing sustainability issues to the top of the agenda.

But these days ""going green"" is as much about business survival as reducing impact on the environment.

Yet surveys show many businesses still struggle to understand the technologies available and are wary about the upfront costs involved.

Technology of Business offers a guide to the most effective ways businesses can cut their energy bills and begin operating more sustainably.

LED lighting

Switching to LED - Light Emitting Diode - lighting is the quickest and simplest action any business can take to reduce energy usage, argues Myles McCarthy, director of implementation at the Carbon Trust.

A traditional 60 watt incandescent bulb would produce about 750 to 1,000 lumens - a measure of lighting power - but 95% of the energy used to create that light would typically be wasted in heat.

Modern LED lights are much more thermally efficient and can now produce between 50 and 100 lumens per watt (lm/W) in normal working conditions.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Switching to LED lighting is the simplest way for businesses to cut their energy bills

One US manufacturer, Cree, reckons it has produced a white light LED bulb that can produce 300 lm/W.

Mr McCarthy says payback on investment in LED is typically between one and three years. For example, one retail outlet client invested £74,000 in new lighting, resulting in a 74% lighting energy reduction and savings of around £33,000 per year, he says.

""This is why we've seen considerable investment in LED in recent years.""

Smart monitoring

Smart meters, thermostats, and sensors - part of what's being called ""the internet of things"" - are giving us data about our energy consumption patterns that we never had before.

""It's the ability of these meters to communicate that's smart, not their ability to record energy usage,"" argues Joel Hagan, chief executive of smart metering company, Onzo.

""They give us far more visibility than we ever had before, down to the energy usage of individual appliances.""

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Applying ""internet of things"" data analytics to Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington could reduce energy usage by 10% a year, the company says, saving it ""millions of dollars""

This increased visibility is helping businesses identify energy wastage more easily and make potentially huge savings.

Quentin Clark, head of Microsoft's data platform group, told the BBC: ""By implementing internet of things control systems and big data analytics at our headquarters campus [in Redmond, Washington] we were able to spot aberrations in our energy usage, such as a garage that had air conditioning.""

Microsoft says its 88 Acres project, involving 125 buildings, 30,000 pieces of equipment generating 500 million data transactions every day, could produce energy savings of up to 10% a year for the company, saving it ""millions of dollars"".

Image copyright Walgreens Image caption Walgreens' first ""net zero energy"" store just outside Chicago

Image copyright Walgreens Image caption The store uses low-energy LED lighting controlled by an energy management system

In another example, Mike Franco, chief executive of California-based smart building systems firm, RiptideIO, says his company implemented a $20m [£12m; 14m euros] energy management system for US drugstore chain, Walgreens.

The project, which involved thousands of stores, saved the retailer $14m last year alone, he says.

Walgreens completed its first ""net zero energy"" store just outside Chicago late last year, incorporating solar photovoltaic (PV), LED lighting and wind turbines to produce more energy than it takes from the grid.

Up the junction

Any conglomeration of buildings can benefit from lighting and energy control systems, says Chris Bedford, managing director of intelligent lighting controls company, Open Technology.

A recent project at Clapham Junction railway station in London reduced lighting energy usage by 40%, he says.

Image copyright Network rail Image caption Control systems have cut lighting energy usage by 40% at London's Clapham Junction railway station

The initial investment of about £30,000 formed part of a wider energy reduction strategy to achieve total annual savings of over £7m for Network Rail and South West Trains.

Smaller energy control system projects can cost about £6,000 and above, depending on the size of the business, he added.

With savings like these on offer, it's no wonder Martin Chilcott, founder of sustainable business community 2degrees, says: ""Our Trends Tracker survey shows that businesses consider smart metering and energy management software to be second only to LED lighting in importance.""

Solar gain

Once a business has made efficiencies to its current equipment and energy usage patterns, generating its own electricity through renewable technology could be a sensible next step, experts advise.

The Energy Saving Trust's Greg Shreeve describes solar PV as a ""sure-fire"" investment for businesses with the necessary capital.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The National Museum of Taiwan History in Tainan features a giant wall of solar panels

The cost of installing PV panels has fallen dramatically over the last 10 years while their efficiency has improved, making them an obvious useful addition to business buildings big or small.

Not only can they help reduce your electricity bills but you'll get paid for the electricity you generate and export to the grid thanks to the UK's Feed-In Tariffs (FITs) scheme.

Introduced in April 2010, the scheme pays businesses for the electricity they generate through solar, wind turbines, hydro, anaerobic digesters or combined heat-and-power systems. The rate of generation subsidy - currently more than 14p per kilowatt hour for small schemes - is under review and could be reduced.

And how much support you receive also depends on your property's Energy Performance Certificate rating, so it makes sense to have improved your firm's energy efficiency before applying.

But with small-scale solar PV systems currently costing between £5,000 and £10,000, you could still see a return on investment within six to 10 years, installers say.

Electric fruit

Local delivery companies should consider switching their fleets to electric vehicles, advises Tim Anderson, senior transport manager at the Energy Saving Trust.

When Fruit4London, a small company delivering fresh fruit to city workers, invested in a fleet of four electric vans, ""It was one of the best decisions we ever made,"" says co-founder Laszlo Mulato.

Image copyright Spanyol Image caption Fruit4London says switching to electric vans was ""one of the best decisions we ever made"".

A £5,000 government subsidy for electric vehicles reduced the cost of each Renault van to about £13,000 (plus VAT), says Mr Mulato. And each van saves the business £9,000 a year in congestion charge fees, maintenance and fuel costs, he adds.

""We haven't been able to increase our prices for five years, so savings like these help keep us competitive.""

The company leases the vehicle battery from Renault for about £70 a month and it costs less than £1 a day to charge. With each van doing up to 60 miles a day, range is not an issue, he adds.

The switch to electric vehicles has had the added advantage of pleasing big clients who want their suppliers to be green as well, says Mr Mulato.",Energy-saving technologies cutting firms' fuel bills,http://www.bbc.com,"[Bbc Business, Matthew Wall, Lucy Fisher]",https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74715000/jpg/_74715290_low-energylightbulb.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27292314

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Self-employment is credited with keeping unemployment down

Self-employment is one of the big stories of the recovery. One in seven workers in the UK are now working for themselves.

The latest jobs figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that there are now 4.54 million self-employed people. That is about 8% higher than a year ago.

In fact, there are now 780,000 more people in employment than there were this time last year, and 40% of those are self-employed.

Alternative to retirement

Being my own boss gives me much more freedom. You get out what you put in Akbar Vindhani, Crown Laundry owner

Over the longer term, the biggest rise in self-employment has been seen in the number of older workers. According to the ONS, self-employment among the over-50s is up 36% on 10 years ago.

The independent think tank the Resolution Foundation believes the main reason for this is the fact that self-employment seems to be growing as an alternative to retirement.

It says that more than a quarter (28%) of the rise in the number of people working for themselves is due to a decline in the rate at which people leave self-employment.

Through analysis of data from the ONS, the Resolution Foundation also found that more than half of self-employed people aged 60 or over now work part-time, that is up from 46% in 2005.

In other words, self-employment is increasingly an option that allows older people to keep earning but by working less.

No other option?

This trend helps explain the big growth in overall part-time self-employment seen in recent years. The proportion of women joining these ranks is also growing.

Self-employment over the past decade 36% rise among over-50s

7% rise among 35 to 49-year-olds

But for many people, self-employment has often been a last resort, especially as the recession took hold.

Akbar Vindhani was forced into working for himself after being unemployed for three months with no sign of a job, despite numerous applications to local firms.

So he started a commercial laundry business, Crown Laundry, with his brother in Leicester and with financial help from his family.

The 25-year-old says it was tough at the beginning, but he has not looked back.

Image caption Akbar Vindhani started his laundry business after failing to find a job

""I think being unemployed was a blessing in disguise. I never thought I'd be my own boss but it's working out pretty good,"" he told me.

If it means that people are underemployed for a prolonged period of time, that's a sign the economy is still weak John Philpott, Economist

Akbar says he cannot see himself working for anyone else in the future either.

""Being my own boss gives me much more freedom. You get out what you put in. We're growing in a steady manner and we hope to grow more rapidly in the near future.""

Akbar says he is actually financially better off, but that does not seem to be the case for most self-employed workers.

The Resolution Foundation reckons that average weekly earnings for the self-employed have tumbled by 20% since 2007, compared with a fall of just 6% for employees over the same period.

'Safety valve'

The increase in part-time hours helps explain this disparity, but there is a suspicion that some self-employed workers are not getting enough work, or are underemployed.

Self-employment was on the rise long before the recession, but its pace has accelerated since the downturn.

""I think self-employment has been a safety valve against unemployment, it's meant that people who in the past would have no work at all are able to do something,"" says the economist, John Philpott,

""On the other hand, if it means that people are underemployed for a prolonged period of time, that's a sign the economy is still weak and we need to do more to boost demand, so that we create jobs for everyone who wants them,"" he adds.

To put it another way, self-employment can be seen as a sign of economic weakness or strength.

The hope is that as the economy recovers, more of the self-employed will be genuine entrepreneurs who will go on to hire other people.

That is certainly how Akbar Vindhani sees himself.

Mobile devices have transformed our lives, giving us the freedom to talk, work, watch and listen on the move.

But unplugged from the mains, they only last as long as the energy held within their batteries.

And there's the rub.

While scientists are constantly dreaming up new ways to generate and bottle energy - from rhubarb and paper to viruses and urine - commercial battery technology has changed remarkably little in the past 50 years, particularly when compared with the advances in the devices they power.

As Tim Probert, editor at Energy Storage Publishing, says: ""The battery industry is pretty conservative. It says a lot that we are still using very old technology like lead-acid in batteries.

""Breakthrough technologies are great but they need a reality check - this industry is all about small, incremental improvements.""

Slow moving

The humble AA battery has been around since the 1940s and is based on 19th Century technology. But it still has a 15% share of the global battery market, along with other alkaline batteries.

And the lead-acid battery, which is fundamental to most combustion engine-powered cars, was invented more than 150 years ago and holds a 20% share of the market.

Clearly the battery industry, which is worth almost $90bn (£54bn; 66bn euros) globally, is not keeping pace with innovation in consumer electronics.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption AA batteries were standardised in the 1940 but are still widely used in many consumer devices

Even the near-ubiquitous rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which powers most modern gadgets, was invented in the 1970s.

It has about a 40% market share.

Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla, the brainchild of serial entrepreneur and billionaire Elon Musk, uses so-called 18650 lithium cells - ""essentially old laptop batteries"", according to Mr Probert - to power its cars.

Most laptop manufacturers gave up on 18650s long ago, but Tesla believes this old tech still has a future, and even has plans to build its own ""gigafactory"" to produce them.

""By choosing smaller, cylindrical cells, we have been able to save on manufacturing costs,"" explains Tesla's Laura Hardy.

""Smaller cells, which can have a better energy density, gave us more flexibility in packaging the cells and creating the battery pack.""

By putting 7,000 of these cells together, Tesla's Model S Sedan is able to achieve a range of up to 300 miles, considerably more than many of its competitors using more advanced battery technologies.

Solid improvement

Most other manufacturers use pouch cells, which involve lithium cells being placed side by side like slices of bread. The danger here is the risk of ""thermal runaway"", where one cell short-circuits and produces so much heat it sparks a ripple effect and the battery blows up.

This is thought to be what happened to Boeing's Dreamliner passenger jet in Japan at the beginning of last year.

The next generation of lithium-ion batteries will help solve this problem by replacing flammable liquid electrolyte with safer, solid-state components. This type of battery is also more powerful per unit.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most electric cars rely on lithium-ion batteries, a technology developed in the 1970s

Some companies are also trying to develop lithium-sulphur batteries, which promise to have five times the energy of a standard lithium-ion.

Mr Probert says UK-based Oxis Energy is making some real progress in this area, but warns that we should not expect a ""quantum leap"" any time soon.

New discovery

The more realistic and exciting developments are taking place away from pure battery technology.

The first is wireless power - charging your gadgets without having to plug them in to the mains.

This is a market that could be worth $5bn by 2016, according to IMS Research (now part of IHS).

One company pioneering this new technology is Ossia, with its Cota remote power system. Founder and chief executive Hatem Zeine stumbled across the idea while researching wireless signal management.

Image copyright other Image caption Cota inventor Hatem Zeine believes the best inventions are discovered by accident

He discovered that a small amount of power is transmitted alongside the radio waves, and set about researching how best to focus the signal from many antennae working in unison as a means to charge devices remotely. In 2013, more than decade later, Mr Zeine launched Cota.

""Cota comes in two parts - a charger and a power receiver,"" Mr Zeine explains. ""Think of the charger as similar to a wireless router, and the receiver as a button battery.""

""The receiver sends out a low power signal to the charger, which in turn sends back a signal from each of its thousands of antennae, targeted specifically at the receiver itself. The receiver will then track the device constantly.""

The benefits are obvious. You no longer have to worry about recharging your phone or laptop, as it will do so automatically whenever it is within range of a charger.

This means the battery doesn't need to store as much energy, and so can be made much smaller - the holy grail for all consumer electronics manufacturers.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Battery tech has moved slowly: Light-bulb inventor Thomas Edison developed a nickel-ion battery in 1901

Mr Zeine believes the applications for wireless charging go way beyond consumer electronics and into medical devices, production lines and construction.

Indeed, he envisages a time when we need far fewer power sockets because remote chargers will be installed throughout our homes, offices, public buildings, cars and trains.

Water in, water out

Swedish company MyFC, an offshoot of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, has developed Powertrekk, a portable fuel cell that can generate energy to power all manner of consumer devices.

""Our fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that converts hydrogen into protons and electrons. The protons go through a membrane and react with oxygen, so the only bi-product is water,"" explains Bjorn Westerholm, MyFC's chief executive.

Powertrekk, which provides up to 5 watts of power, incorporates a lithium-ion battery to provide the initial charge, before the fuel cell takes over. Once the device is fully charged, the fuel cell then recharges the battery.

Image copyright other Image caption Powertrekk's fuel cell turns the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen into electricity

This means you can power a device with just water and a small sodium silicide refill canister, anywhere at any time.

Powertrekk is being sold in 24 countries including, as of late May, the UK. Since launching a year ago, MyFC has sold 10,000 units.

Given that mobile phones and tablets are currently selling at a rate of about two billion a year, ""we haven't even scratched the surface yet"", says Mr Westerholm.

Starting from humble roots, the confectionery business used to have just four employees. However, it has now expanded to employ more than 80 people, baking about 10,000 biscuits and crispbreads every day.

""Latvia is a very young country and the tradition of business is only just developing,"" says their daughter Ksenija Magomedova, the company's sales manager.

""Our business is one of a kind because there aren't very many family businesses in Latvia,"" she adds.

""Lots of people have left the country and businesses have been sold because the economy over the past 20 years has been so volatile.""

'More opportunities'

But the entrepreneurial Magomedov family believes Latvia's fortunes have been on the up since it joined the the European Union 10 years ago.

""We have more export opportunities, we have become more competitive, we make more products than ever before,"" enthuses Ksenija.

Turnover is up 80% from 10 years ago, but it is not just the financial aspects of being in a western economic bloc that Baltas Naktis values.

""Basically we feel safer working with EU partners. We know the companies, we can always track them and trace them. We feel safer sending our goods there and receiving the payments,"" says Ksenija.

While the business community backed joining the EU, as many as a third of the population voted against in the national referendum in 2003.

One of them was farmer Janis Dzenis.

One hundred kilometres south-east of the capital Riga, in rural Latvia, he shows me around the land he inherited after the fall of communism.

The farm was repatriated to him after he used documentation to prove that his family owned the land prior to the Soviet Union seizing it as part of the common ownership policy.

Scarred by the experience of his country being part of the Soviet Union, Janis is sceptical about Latvia's membership of another union, the EU.

""I believe that complete freedom and independence are more important than joining the European Union,"" he says.

""[If you are independent] then you are the one that decides everything that happens in the country - economics, politics, production and agriculture.""

A decade on and Janis remains opposed to Latvian membership, despite the £300,000 he has received in EU grants over the years to help buy new tractors, machinery and three giant storage silos.

""Being part of the European Union, we have to accept the EU agriculture policy.

""I have thoroughly analysed these rules and I have realised that they are not like the ones that we had during our first independence in 1918. Then we had carefully developed Latvian agriculture policy and there was some tangible result.

""Currently we are losing because of the agriculture policy of the European Union and we are losing quite dramatically.""

'Cliffhanger nation'

Since joining the European Union there have been some financial benefits.

For example, Latvia has received about £3.5bn in grants and the economy had almost trebled in size until the global financial crisis struck.

As a result gross domestic product collapsed, a deep recession ensued and emigration became increasingly popular for tens of thousands of Latvians who took advantage of one of the EU's founding objectives - the freedom of movement between member states.

So for a population hovering around the 2 million mark - down from almost 2.7 million a quarter of a century ago - has EU membership changed the Latvians?

A prominent Latvian journalist, who once described Latvia as ""the cliffhanger nation"" because it has appeared and disappeared from the map so many times, seems like the perfect person to ask.

""I think you have to look at generations,"" says Pauls Raudseps.

""The older generation which grew up in the Soviet Union still feels a little distant from [the EU] because they have no direct personal experience with that, their childhood memories are in the Soviet times,

87,"Image copyright GEORGINA GOODWIN Image caption M-Kopa's mobile-enabled solar panels are bringing power to off-grid low-income households in Kenya

John Kibet's home in rural Kenya is not linked to the country's electricity grid.

The only way he could generate power was by using a kerosene-powered generator. This was dirty, smelly and dangerous.

But now things are different.

Mr Kibet, a farmer with 15 acres of commercial land on the outskirts of Kitale, has switched to solar-generated electricity which he pays for using his mobile phone.

""I saw it can save you a lot of money,"" he told the BBC. ""It's improved my life, for now I don't use kerosene anymore - I have my own light. And it's bright.""

This combination of solar technology and mobile micro-payments is being rolled out across Kenya by a company called M-Kopa Solar.

More than 70,000 households have signed up so far, with 1,000 more joining every week, the company says. And take-up is spreading into neighbouring Uganda.

M-Kopa hopes to be in a million homes by 2018.

'Unhealthy'

""Kerosene is a terrible thing to have to burn in your home - expensive, dirty, unhealthy and ultimately not very bright,"" explains M-Kopa co-founder Jesse Moore.

""I've never met a customer who likes kerosene, which makes for a great starting point for building our business.""

A typical domestic set-up includes a 4W or 5W solar photovoltaic panel, lights, a mobile phone charging point, and an optional rechargeable radio.

Image copyright GEORGINA GOODWIN Image caption The solar panel soaks up sun during the day to power lights and chargers at night

Now Mr Kibet only uses kerosene for lighting cooking fires. ""M-Kopa is cheaper,"" he says.

Households buy the system through the M-Pesa mobile payment platform set up by mobile operators Vodafone and Safaricom.

After putting down a deposit of 2,999 Kenyan shillings (Ksh) - about £20 - householders then pay 50Ksh a day for a year until they own the kit outright.

This compares with the 17,000Ksh a year off-grid households spend on kerosene, says Safaricom boss Bob Collymore.

Mobile payments

The solar panels contain embedded SIM cards that can communicate with M-Kopa's control centre.

""Each and every customer's solar energy system is connected to M-Kopanet allowing us to monitor its performance, troubleshoot issues, as well as control its operational state,"" says co-founder Nick Hughes, who also led the Vodafone team behind M-Pesa.

""We can disable systems remotely if payments are missed, or reactivate them when customers catch up,"" he adds.

Image copyright M-KOPA Image caption John Kibet can now check his animals using a roaming solar-powered light

But the default rate on payments is just 5%, the company says.

Through the M-Pesa system - ""pesa"" means money in Swahili - people can pay bills simply by sending a text message to the recipient stating the amount that needs to be paid. The recipient can then redeem the money at an M-Pesa agent.

""M-Pesa is a stand-out example of how technology can solve problems - in this case how to move cash over distances quickly, securely and in an affordable way,"" Mr Hughes told the BBC.

""Today, M-Pesa is seven years old, and does hundreds of transactions a second. It has changed the way money moves in Kenya.""

About 25% of Kenya's gross domestic product is thought to flow through the platform.

Leap-frogging

Mr Kibet is one of a growing number of people in developing economies who have leap-frogged traditional computing technologies and gone straight to mobile for accessing the internet.

According to mobile industry body GSMA, the number of mobile phone subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa - currently more than 250 million - is forecast to rise to nearly 350 million by 2017.

Access to fixed-line phones at home is less than 5% in the region, but almost all households have access to a basic mobile.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About a quarter of Kenya's gross domestic product flows through the M-Pesa mobile payment system

And now smartphones are growing fast in popularity, too. They accounted for 67% of mobile sales in Kenya between 2013 and 2014, says Safaricom, and more than 100,000 are being bought each month.

This mobile revolution is presenting a blank canvas for new technologies, says Mr Hughes.

""Perhaps the biggest difference in Africa that I find hugely exciting is the opportunity to build innovative services without tackling the inertia of legacy systems,"" he says.

Wireless water

Mobile is also helping provide better, more sustainable water supplies for Africa.

For example, Mobile Water for Development, a project based at the University of Oxford, undertakes a number of studies to try to improve rural access to water through mobile technology.

Projects have included a one-year study into ""smart handpumps"" - water pumps that can transmit their operational status via embedded mobile technology.

According to some estimates, a third of handpumps in Africa don't work at any one time.

Data collected from these smart pumps reveal usage patterns that then alert water companies when it looks like a pump isn't working.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A third of African water pumps are not working at any one time, studies suggest

They can then send out engineers quickly to fix the pumps before villagers are forced to resort to dirtier sources of water.

In another example, a water company in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, teamed up with telecoms firms Vodacom and Zain - later Airtel Money - in 2009 to introduce mobile payment services for water.

Since then, mobile payment services have blossomed in sub-Saharan Africa, with water companies using payments services including M-Pesa, Airtel Money, and MTN Mobile Money.

Ineffective billing and payment collection has been costing the African water industry $500m (£300m) a year, according to the World Bank.

But studies have shown that making payments easier helps reduce corruption and improve revenue and data collection per customer, thereby enabling water companies to invest more in their services and operate them more efficiently.

This is crucial in a continent where reliable supplies of clean drinking water are often hard to come by.

Will Dean is often described as ""the Mark Zuckerberg of extreme sports"". It is not always meant as a compliment.

Mr Dean, 33, is the founder and boss of Tough Mudder, the world's biggest organiser of extreme obstacle course races.

Last year, half a million people around the world paid up to $200 (£120) to take part in one of the company's events.

In exchange for their money, participants try to run, jump, swim, crawl and haul themselves around a 10 to 12 mile (16 to 19km) military-style obstacle course.

In their way are up to 25 obstacles which - among relentless inhumanities - force people to submerge themselves in icy water, slither through mud, dodge live electric cables and barbed wire, and somehow push their weary bodies over numerous walls.

People talk about this industry, but if you look at the stats - and I don't mean to brag - we are this industry Will Dean

While this sounds like hell to most of us, New-York-based Tough Mudder is tremendously popular - its events can sell out months in advance.

And while the company was only established in 2010, it now enjoys annual revenues of more than $100m (£60m).

So far so wonderful, except that the boss of a rival company accuses Mr Dean of stealing his idea.

And the owner of another competitor to Tough Mudder said last year: ""There's not a person on this planet I despise more than Will Dean.""

It seems that the often brutal nature of extreme sports is not just reserved for events days.

'Form of flattery'

Like Facebook founder Mr Zuckerberg, Mr Dean went to Harvard University in Boston.

Mr Dean, who is British, did Harvard's celebrated Master of Business Administration (MBA) course from 2007 to 2009.

Image copyright PA Image caption The Tough Mudder events are popular with both male and female entrants

And while Mr Zuckerberg was accused of stealing the idea for Facebook from two fellow students at the college, Mr Dean has been accused of stealing the idea for Tough Mudder from an existing rival.

However, it is important to stress at this point that both Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Dean have always denied any infringement of intellectual property rights.

Most people are evangelical about us, and a few people are resentful of our success, that is what it boils down to [when you become the market leader] Will Dean

In Mr Dean's case, as part of his MBA he studied an extreme obstacle course event company based in Shropshire, England, called Tough Guy.

Billy Wilson, the owner of Tough Guy, and a former British soldier, allowed Mr Dean to closely analyse his business.

When Mr Dean then went on to establish Tough Mudder a year after leaving Harvard, Mr Wilson sued.

The matter was subsequently settled out of court, with a reported $750,000 (£446,000) being paid to Mr Wilson.

Speaking at Tough Mudder's UK office in central London, a very likeable Mr Dean says he cannot talk about the dispute with Mr Wilson and Tough Guy because of legal restrictions.

Yet he adds that Tough Mudder itself does not have any intellectual property protection, and that any rival can try to replicate its successes.

Image copyright PA Image caption Tough Mudder's courses are designed to make team work an essential part of success

He describes the abuse he has faced as ""a form of flattery"", and an indication of Tough Mudder's domination of the marketplace.

""I think when you are number one it is smart strategy for other organisations to try and position themselves as the underdog brand,"" he says.

""If I was number two I would probably do the same.""

Team event

One fact which is indisputable is the sheer speed of Tough Mudder's growth, which Mr Dean describes as ""nothing short of remarkable"".

This is especially true when you consider that the business has not needed any external investors.

Image copyright PA Image caption Tough Mudder has not required any outside investors to make a leap of faith

Mr Dean adds: ""I said that by 2012 I wanted us to have 7,000 participants, and we had half a million.""

He puts the popularity of Tough Mudder events down to a number of factors, but says the most important is that they have ""got the blend right between it being fun and tough, and [that] it is a team challenge"".

Explaining this, he says that when he first set up Tough Mudder he noticed that all the existing events in the field were race-focused, very serious, and put individuals up against individuals.

By contrast, he says Tough Mudder is an event in which people participate in teams, and while tough, is designed to also be enjoyable, and achievable for most reasonably fit people. And technically Tough Mudder events are not races, as people aren't timed, and everyone gets a winners medal.

Image copyright PA Image caption Tough Mudder's growth has been smoother than many competitors find its courses

Tough Mudder has undoubtedly also benefited from a forensic focus on marketing, such as successfully creating buzz campaigns on social media.

""This is basic business,"" says Mr Dean, ""You can build a great product, but you have to invest in selling it.""

As the number of people signing up to Tough Mudder quickly dwarfed its rivals, Mr Dean says this has enabled the company to ""invest significantly more in its obstacles [that our competitors]"", which has further fuelled its popularity.

Global expansion

Born and bred in Nottinghamshire, in England's East Midlands, prior to enrolling at Harvard, Mr Dean had worked for the UK government's Foreign Office for five years, where he did counter terrorism work.

Image copyright PA Image caption Tough Mudder's events are invariably sell outs

Although he said it was an exciting job, he left to do the MBA as he had always wanted to run his own business.

On completion of the course at Harvard Mr Dean moved to New York to follow his American girlfriend, and now wife, Katie.

Tough Mudder was then born in New York's fashionable Brooklyn in 2010.

Mr Dean, who has a degree in economics and politics from Bristol University, says he is now focused on Tough Mudder's continued international growth. The company currently has 170 staff across its New York, London, Berlin and Melbourne offices.

""People talk about this industry, but if you look at the stats - and I don't mean to brag - we are this industry,"" he says.

""We have between 80% and 85% of the market in the UK, and in the US more like 70% to 75%.""

90,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Are county councils wasting millions by not making more use of the government's digital marketplace?

UK county councils could be ""wasting millions"" on IT services they could buy more cheaply through the government's central digital marketplace, research suggests.

In the 2012-13 financial year, county councils spent nearly £440m in total on IT services, including staffing costs, but just £385,000 of that through the government's ""G-Cloud"" framework.

The G-Cloud initiative, launched in 2012, aims to shave £120m a year off the public sector IT bill by encouraging all public sector bodies to buy IT products and services through the government's CloudStore digital marketplace.

Cloud services are ""quicker, cheaper and more competitive"", according to Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, with some tech companies estimating that they can be 25% to 60% cheaper than traditional long-term IT contracts.

Despite this, G-Cloud is largely being ignored by county councils,

For example, Kent County Council, the biggest IT spender, committed £38.5m to IT services in 2012-13, but just £94,750 of that went through G-Cloud.

Image caption Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude believes the government's G-Cloud could cut millions from the public sector IT bill

Similarly, Hampshire County Council spent £38m, but nothing through G-Cloud.

'Shocking' findings

The findings have emerged after IT services company Bull Information Systems carried out Freedom of Information requests on all 27 UK county councils - 26 responded.

""We think these findings are hugely disappointing and quite shocking,"" Andrew Carr, Bull's UK and Ireland chief executive, told the BBC.

""By sharing infrastructure costs and moving to the cloud, county councils could take 20% to 25% out of total IT costs - they're wasting millions not doing this.""

Switching from long-term contacts with IT providers selling hardware and software to ""pay as you go"" virtual services with a variety of providers is a ""no-brainer"", according to Phil Dawson, chief executive of Skyscape Cloud Services, a G-Cloud accredited provider.

Image copyright David Betteridge Image caption Phil Dawson of Skyscape Cloud Services says adopting cloud is a ""no brainer""

""My one plea to government would be that they shout louder and more frequently about the case studies demonstrating the cost savings that can be achieved through the cloud.

""But while the infrastructure cost savings are plain to see, cloud also delivers the agility and responsiveness we need to provide services fit for the 21st Century,"" he argues.

'Unable to deliver'

Since launch, G-Cloud has seen £175.5m of sales made through the platform up to the end of March 2014, with 60% of those going to small and medium-sized (SMEs) businesses.

CloudStore - soon to be called the Digital Marketplace - now lists 1,518 suppliers offering about 17,000 services, says the Cabinet Office.

While the government is keen to trumpet these figures as signs of progress - particularly for SME IT providers - the fact remains that 80% of those sales were made by central, not local, government.

And the figure seems tiny when compared with a total central government IT spend of about £7bn.

County councils remain apparently unimpressed by - or unaware of - G-Cloud's advantages.

Councillor Mark Hawthorne is the vice-chairman of the County Councils Network, which is part of the Local Government Association.

He told the BBC: ""While the G-Cloud offers a number of contract solutions, for some councils the framework is unable to deliver best value due to the existing nature of their IT contracts where IT management is already outsourced and would have to be recreated at significant cost to make the G-Cloud the right solution for them.

""It would be wrong to assume that non take-up of G-Cloud services represents a missed saving opportunity.""

Cultural issue

But IT service providers - and the government - disagree.

""It makes so much more sense for councils to rent and share virtual services rather than buy hardware, only 15% of which is ever used on average,"" says Bull's Mr Carr.

Image copyright other Image caption There are more than 1,500 suppliers listed on the government's CloudStore website

""The blame for lack of adoption lies primarily with the councils themselves,"" he says. ""There's an unwillingness to change. People continue to do what is simplest and easiest.""

Skyscape's Mr Dawson believes another barrier to the quicker adoption of cloud services by local authorities could be concern that efficiencies and automation may lead to job losses.

""There's no doubt locally run data centres would close,"" he says. ""But there's also an opportunity to create jobs in the app development sector to compensate.""

'Cost-effective'

The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for the G-Cloud project, admits that the benefits of cloud services need to be spelled out more.

""Today, more councils than ever before are using cloud services because of the benefits they bring,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""However, we know more needs to be done to raise awareness of its potential and encourage use.

""Only then can organisations benefit from access to the most innovative, cost-effective solutions by a wide range of suppliers and pass these savings on to the taxpayer.""

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Councils appear unconvinced by the government's cloud computing platform

And it is these potential tax savings that exercise bodies like the Taxpayers' Alliance.

Campaign manager Andy Sylvester says: ""Cloud technology has been saving plenty of small businesses an awful lot of money, and councils should be no different.

""At a time when councils are finding long-overdue savings across their operations, it beggars belief that they are not taking advantage of these new, money-saving technologies.

""Taxpayers expect their council tax to be spent on essential front-line services, not unnecessarily expensive IT.""

'Digital by default'

From April 2014, all new or redesigned government digital services must meet the ""digital by default"" service standard, a key plank of the Government Digital Strategy, published in December 2013.

Achieving this standard could save the government up to £1.8bn a year, it believes, based on the fact that digital transactions are 20 times cheaper than by phone, 30 times cheaper than postal and as much as 50 times cheaper than face-to-face.

Delivering these digital services needs expertise and often a lot of upgrading from old, so-called legacy, computer systems.

This is where G-Cloud is supposed to come in.

But county councils would appear to need more persuading of its benefits - and perhaps a visit or two from the National Audit Office to ensure they are getting best value from their IT contracts.",Councils 'wasting millions' ignoring government IT cloud,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Bbc News, Matthew Wall]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75256000/jpg/_75256211_cloudcomputing.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27618218

This weekend a British woman, Linda Jackson will take over as head of France's Citroen car company.

She is the third woman to take over as the head of a major car firm, following Annette Winkler at Smart and Mary Barra at General Motors.

""I think it's an absolutely fantastic opportunity,"" said Ms Jackson. who is currently Citroen's boss in Britain and Ireland.

Citroen is part of PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-largest carmaker.

Besides her appointment, Yves Bonnefont will also take over as head of the company's new luxury DS brand.

Peugeot Citroen has been badly hit by its reliance on a stagnant European car market - recording net losses of 7.2bn euros ($10bn; £5.9bn) over the past two years.

In April, it unveiled a major recovery programme.

This included cutting costs, focusing on fewer car models, and its strategic partnership with China's Dongfeng Motors.

Should foreign businesses have the right to take a sovereign state to arbitration to seek compensation for a change in the law or government policy? And if so, in exactly what circumstances?

These issues have been raised as a result of a plan being negotiated by the EU and the US called the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

The questions about companies' rights to seek arbitration are the subject of a public consultation exercise that is under way in the EU, ending in early July.

The European Commission has a page on its website for members of the EU public wanting to contribute.

[ISDS] serves as a powerful corporate weapon to delay, weaken and kill regulation Olivier Hoedeman, Corporate Europe Observatory

TTIP is controversial and the proposed rights for foreign investors are especially contentious. That part of the plan is known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS - not to be confused with the International Sheepdog Society).

The basic idea of ISDS is that foreign investors should be able to go to independent arbitration if they believe they have been treated by a host government in a way that breaches an international investment agreement. If they win, they may get compensation.

The potential benefits for the foreign investors are clear enough. But why would governments subject themselves to this kind of constraint?

'Chilling factor'

There are two arguments. The legal protection can be appealing to foreign companies, so it could encourage them to invest when they might not otherwise have done.

And if you offer this arrangement in a bilateral agreement, the same protection would be available to your own companies when they invest in the other country involved.

The inclusion of ISDS in the transatlantic negotiations is hotly debated. Critics say that it could inhibit governments' rights to regulate in the public interest, and expose them and taxpayers to hefty compensation bills if they do regulate in a way that hits foreign investors' profits.

Image copyright AP Image caption TTIP has been controversial, prompting some protests in Europe

Brussels-based Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) is one of the leading groups campaigning against ISDS.

It rejects the idea that ISDS protects investors against unfair behaviour by host states. Instead, the group argues: ""It serves as a powerful corporate weapon to delay, weaken and kill regulation.""

It will be made crystal clear that this agreement will not limit the scope for governments to take decisions on, for example, the balance between public provision of healthcare and private services European Commission

Olivier Hoedeman of the CEO says that ISDS will impose a ""chill factor"" on regulation, as governments will be reluctant to act for fear of being sued.

The group also complains that ISDS gives special privileges to foreign companies and says that it will not bring the economic benefits claimed.

Company v country disputes

This type of provision is not new in international agreements. They have existed for decades and the World Bank has had an agency dedicated to arbitration in such disputes since 1966. But there is some strong evidence that international companies are making more use of them than they used to.

Research by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development found a cumulative total of 568 known cases (and the agency suggests there probably are further cases where there are no public records), most of them happening since the turn of the century.

About half have been concluded, 43% in favour of the state defending itself, 31% in favour of the investor. The remainder were settled.

The largest award to date, so far as is known, went to the oil company Occidental in a dispute with Ecuador over the cancellation of an exploration and drilling agreement. The amount awarded by arbitrators was $1.77bn (£1.06bn) plus interest.

Image copyright PA Image caption Tobacco firm Philip Morris is still in dispute with the Australian government over plain packaging laws

Other cases have involved regulation of energy prices, invalidation of patents and alleged wrongful criminal prosecution. A number of cases have been brought against Spain and the Czech Republic over changes to their treatment of the renewable energy sector.

One of the most famous, or infamous, examples is the complaint by the tobacco company Philip Morris about Australia's plain packaging law. There has been no ruling in that case.

Limited investor protection

In the UK, some campaigners have a specific concern about how ISDS might interact with domestic UK legislation on the National Health Service.

One group, called patients4nhs, says that ISDS means it will be ""virtually impossible in future for the UK government to reverse the privatisation of the NHS that we see as a result of the Health and Social Care Act (2012) - even if this proves to be a disaster.""

The worry for them and other groups is that once foreign companies have a place in the market, they might be able to seek compensation if a British government wanted to revert to public sector provision.

The European Commission does not accept this argument. It says: ""It will be made crystal clear that this agreement will not limit the scope for governments to take decisions on, for example, the balance between public provision of healthcare and private services.""

John Clancy, a spokesman for the Trade Commissioner, Karel de Gucht, says the protection that investors would get would cover a limited number of actions, such as ""discrimination, denial of access to justice, expropriation without compensation and the inability to transfer capital to invest"".

One is a two-bedroom, ground floor flat, which the estate agent says offers an opportunity for the buyer to give it ""the love it deserves"". The other is a four-bedroom, detached family home with a conservatory at the back and an integral garage.

The difference in the price tags of these property siblings is about £85,000.

Only when you discover that the flat on the left is on Hazelwood Road, east London, and the house on the right is on Hazelwood Road, Wigan, does it become clear which is actually the more expensive.

They are an example of the regional variations in the UK housing market, not only in terms of price but also of the social implications that may result.

Image caption The street name might be the same but property prices are very different

The latest official house price figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed property values had increased by 8% in the UK in the year to the end of March.

But they mirrored the view of many commentators that there is a housing market in London, and another one everywhere else. In London, prices rose by 17% annually. In north-west England, they were up by 3.1%.

The Land Registry also recorded a 17% year-on-year price rise in London.

Such increases proved a temptation for the owner of the Hazelwood Road property in Walthamstow, east London. She says ""the price is right"" to sell the property at an asking price of £325,000. She bought it for £140,000 in 2002.

""Lots of people want to buy in this area now,"" she says.

That demand, alongside a lack of homes on the market and low mortgage rates, has led to a market in London that many have described as overheating.

Graham Beale, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, says there will soon be a ""natural correction"" in house prices in London - although there is little sign of it as yet.

""What we will see over the next year is the big difference in house prices in London and elsewhere will narrow considerably as prices elsewhere begin to pick up,"" he says.

Andrew Regan, of Regan and Hallworth estate agents, is marketing the four-bedroom home in Hazelwood Road, on the Whitley estate in Wigan, with an asking price of £239,950.

The housing market in the area, he says, is ""vibrant and balanced"" but the hue and cry over a property bubble is not helping.

""We are experiencing modest house price growth. We also have plenty of new-build developments either being built or about to start. I would say that, at present in the Wigan area, the balance is just right for sustainable growth,"" he says.

""It can be a tad frustrating when we see customers who say they are being told prices are going up and up and there is a bubble.""

Activity is picking up, he says, pointing out that he has put 18% more properties on the market now than at this time last year.

He accepts that they might start to test the market - shorthand for adding a little more to asking prices - but says that property values remain below their 2007 peak.

Relocation problems

The key for most mortgage borrowers is affordability. In Wigan, the cost of a mortgage is less than the cost of renting for most people, according to Mr Regan, and that is encouraging buyers to take a look.

The Help to Buy scheme had also led to some first-time buyers showing more of an interest. This type of buyer has little in savings, but can afford to make mortgage repayments.

But in London, average incomes are not rising at anything like the rate that house prices are going up. If that continues, academics say there could be significant social implications.

""There is a mobility issue [for workers],"" says Bill Davies, research fellow at centre-left think tank IPPR North. ""It is a huge headache for key workers. Allowances will have to take this into account if the government does not act on supply.""

He questions the ability of the housing market in London to correct itself if properties are seen as an investment, rather than somewhere to live. These homes could lie empty or only be used for part of the year, effectively putting a further squeeze on supply.

Image copyright Other/ap Image caption In the US, the federal government is based in Washington while New York is the centre of commerce

This is a particular problem in the UK, says Kath Scanlon, research fellow at the London School of Economics, because so much economic activity is centralised in London.

In the US, she says, it is different with centres of government in Washington, of commerce in New York and of technology in San Francisco.

The housing stock in London may also be skewed towards brand new apartments which are more likely to attract overseas investors than families looking for somewhere to live with a garden.

And if young first-time buyers are being priced out of the market, she says, then their parents are less likely to sell the family home, thinking that their 20-something children might move back in while they save for their first property.

All of this will restrict supply. And it is the lack of supply that most commentators and economists say is the reason for rising house prices.","House prices: Same street, different property market",http://www.bbc.com,"[Personal Finance Reporter Bbc News, Kevin Peachey]",https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75197000/jpg/_75197012_hazelwoodcomp.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27636162
94,"Image caption Paul and Rob Forkan have a strong sense of social responsibility

If you want to know what motivates the founders of sandal-making firm Gandys Flip Flops, try standing in their shoes.

Brothers Rob and Paul Forkan are only 26 and 24 respectively, but they've already seen more tragedies and triumphs than most people manage in a lifetime.

Nearly a decade after losing their parents in the Asian tsunami of 2004 and almost getting killed themselves, the pair are preparing to open a children's home in India, saying they want to help their fellow orphans.

In the meantime, their London-based brand of ethically sourced footwear, established in 2011, has begun to make tracks, with 150,000 pairs manufactured so far.

UK stores already selling their sandals include Selfridges, Liberty and Accessorize, as well as stockists in Germany and a number of other European markets.

Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve Paul Forkan, Gandys Flip Flops

""We give 10% of our profits back to charity and we've got our own foundation on the side as well, "" says Paul. ""We're all about making profit, but a profit with a purpose.""

Life skills

The Forkan brothers had an unconventional childhood, which they reckon has done much to fuel their current success. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India.

Paul, who was hampered by dyslexia at school, welcomed the change. He remembers ""living like hippies"", with little formal learning but lots of voluntary work.

Image caption Gandys sandals come in a wide range of colours

""We'd go to children's homes, play sports with the kids, help them out with cooking, teach them stuff, which was really cool,"" he says.

""We helped with fund-raising for the local charities as well. We learned some really good life skills. Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve.""

In the long term, we'd like to have children's homes in every continent in the world Paul Forkan, Gandys Flip Flops

The family were on holiday in Sri Lanka when the tsunami struck. The Forkans' parents died saving Rob and Paul's younger siblings, Matt and Rosie.

Although the disaster was a tough blow for the children, Paul says the way they were brought up made them strong enough to cope.

""Our parents gave us the attitude that if you get knocked off your bike, just get back on it. There's always people worse off than you,"" he says.

Fortunately, the children were then adopted by an older sister, Marie, who lives in Farnborough in Hampshire. Rob and Paul spent a couple of years living there before embarking on separate travels round the world.

Indian inspiration

By 2011, they were sharing living quarters in Brixton, south London, where they started their footwear business.

Paul says their inspiration came from the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi.

""He was in all our schoolbooks as kids, he's on all the money over in India, he's famous for wearing his flip flops,"" he says.

Image caption Gandys is looking to expand internationally

""[And] there's a slang term in London. After a night out, you say that you've got a mouth as dry as Gandhi's flip flops. Rob was at a festival and woke up the next morning with a dry mouth.

""He told me about it and said, 'We're going to look to do a lot of social projects in India, Sri Lanka and then, eventually, open a children's home for the 10th anniversary of the tsunami.'

""That was what made me think, actually, this is a great business, doing good.""

The brothers began the business with less than £10,000 in start-up capital, mainly from savings.

""We thought, 'That'll be enough to get us going,' not realising that you just burn through money straight away,"" says Paul. ""It lasted six months.""

Brothers' Den

To secure further funding, they decided to turn the Dragons' Den concept on its head, inviting several wealthy potential investors to a Brixton pub and asking them to compete for the chance to invest.

""We did this thing called Brothers' Den,"" Paul recalls. ""These guys came down in their suits. We were in our shorts and flip flops.""

Fortunately, it worked, and the pair were able to obtain the investment they needed.

But that wasn't the only setback the firm faced in the early days. Initial batches of Gandys flip flops were hand-made in India using jute, but Paul and Rob were unhappy with the results.

Image caption The firm's initial flip flop had quality control problems

""If you brought in 100, you could only sell 10 of them, because of poor quality control,"" says Paul.

The sandals are now factory-made in China, and Rob visits the premises regularly to monitor production.

Gandys now has a full-time staff of 14, including a designer and a brand manager, as well as marketing, sales and press personnel. Its headquarters is in Southfields in south London, near Wimbledon, with a further office in Stoke.

About 70% of the firm's sales so far have been in the UK, but later this year, the brothers will launch the brand in Australia and the US.

""In five years' time, I'd like our flip flops to be seen in all the top shops in America,"" says Paul. ""On the other side of the business, giving back, I'd like to have projects all over the world.

95,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Dutch-style pensions are on their way to the UK

Once, personal pensions were simple. You paid money in every month, and you knew how much cash you would receive once you retired.

But this ""defined benefit"" model now provides gold-plating only for the lucky few.

Many more people now pay into a scheme based on ""defined contribution"" (DC).

That means you know exactly how much you are paying in.

But you do not know for sure how much you will get out - i.e. how big your pension will be.

As a result, the government wants to allow Dutch-style ""collective"" defined contribution schemes, known as CDCs.

Such schemes are designed to give people more certainty over their retirement incomes. It is claimed they can also increase the value of pay-outs by around a third.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Workers from similar professions would group together in CDCs

What does a collective scheme do?

The best way to think of a collective scheme is to see it as being halfway between a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.

From an employer's perspective, there is no risk, as he or she will pay out the same amount every month. That makes it look like a defined contribution scheme.

But from an employee's point of view, there is a target for what he or she will receive on retirement.

For example, the target might be 30% of their salary, after they retire. That makes it look like a defined benefit scheme.

Why are they called ""collective"" schemes?

Conventional pension schemes involve hundreds, or even thousands, of employees. But in collective schemes, tens of thousands of employees get together in a single pension plan.

A collective scheme might therefore involve workers across an industry - such as shop workers, or taxi drivers - rather than a single company.

Do they provide better returns?

They can do. Their larger scale means their costs are lower. Unlike conventional DC schemes, they do not have to account for each employee's individual pension pot.

They are also able to invest in longer-term assets, such as transport projects or mortgages.

For accounting reasons, other pension schemes rely more on the bond markets, which are stable, but can provide lower returns.

But unlike a defined benefit scheme, these returns are not guaranteed. For example, in 2012, a quarter of the schemes in the Netherlands cut pensions by an average of 1.9%, to restore their finances.

Is it true they can provide a pension which is 30% larger?

Image copyright Thinkstock

David Pitt Watson, the chairman of Hermes Focus Asset Management, has said returns on CDCs can be ""up to 39% "" higher than DC schemes.

A study of CDCs between 1955 and 2011 by consultants Aon Hewitt compared them with defined contribution schemes.

It concluded that those retiring on the average DC scheme received 21% of their previous salaries. Those on a CDC scheme received 28% of salary, out-performing the DC schemes by 25%.

But the study also showed that CDCs did not provide superior returns in every year.

Between 1994 and 2004, the reverse was true. However, the study argued that CDC projections are much less volatile. ""The pension journey is more stable and contains fewer surprises,"" it said.

Some pensions experts, including Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown, say they doubt that such returns are actually achievable.

So what are the disadvantages of CDCs?

•There is no guarantee that workers retiring will actually receive the target proportion of their salaries.

•Workers using defined contribution schemes will get new freedoms to use their pension pots as they like from April 2015. It is not clear whether CDC members will get the same freedom.

•DC workplace pension charges will be capped from April at 0.75% a year. It is unclear whether such a cap will be imposed on CDC schemes.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ready for a transplant? Dutch firms are already offering to bring CDC schemes to the UK

Could CDC schemes work in the UK?

Critics argue that the Netherlands has a very different social structure from the UK, so collective schemes might prove difficult to run here.

They would need serious co-operation between different employers, to sign up hundreds of thousands of employees.

And following the government's auto-enrolment initiative, all but the smallest companies are already signed up to pension schemes.

The TUC is an enthusiastic supporter of CDC schemes. But it believes employers will need substantial incentives to start them off.

Several Dutch pension funds have said they would be happy to launch schemes in the UK.

Is it true the Dutch actually want pensions more like the British?

The youth wings of three Dutch political parties have come together to push for pension reforms in Holland. But there is no widespread revolt against CDCs.

Pensioners in Holland enjoy much bigger pensions than those in the UK, but that is partly because of higher contribution rates.

Dutch workers contribute between 21% and 25% of their pre-tax pay to their pensions. In the UK, we contribute 9.4%.

Who runs a CDC scheme?

The schemes are run by a group of actuaries. Rather like ""with-profit"" schemes, the actuaries declare the pension pay-out rate for every year.

They can decide to cross-subsidise the generations, by cutting or increasing payouts for workers in a particular age range.",Going Dutch: What is a collective pension scheme?,http://www.bbc.com,"[Personal Finance Reporter Bbc News, Brian Milligan]",https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75251000/jpg/_75251991_477222377.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27665364

Global football sponsorship is now much more than firms just handing over money to governing bodies such as Fifa for pitch-side promotion on billboards.

The relationship is now a much more textured one, with this year's World Cup sponsors aware of the growing non-commercial, and social and political, nuances around their role as financial backers of this huge sporting event.

This can be seen by the way Sony has involved itself in the furore around the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.

Fellow sponsor Adidas says the ongoing issue is ""neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners"".

And another massive backer, Coca-Cola, says it is prepared to tone down its branding message in the face of the re-emergence of social unrest in Brazil during the tournament.

'Realistic' approach

""Companies and brands are becoming increasingly aware, and have an added push and impetus towards showing ordinary people they are aware that there is a social aspect to being a sponsor,"" says Nigel Currie, from sports sponsorship agency Brand Rapport.

""When firms are involved in major sporting events like the World Cup there has to be an increased awareness of the outside world, and to take a more realistic approach to the world that people can respect.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graffiti like this - depicting a hungry child offered a football to eat - expresses many Brazilians' discontent with the World Cup costs

Sponsors are not launching their usual type of marketing strategies in case they are targeted by protesters Amir Somoggi, Sports marketing consultant

He says that with such a high-profile tournament protest groups in Brazil were realising the potential of targeting not only the event itself but also sponsors. For instance, hacker group Anonymous has said it is preparing a cyber-attack on sponsor websites.

""The sponsors have to be ready for any potential banana skins that might come their way,"" he says.

So, with the 2014 tournament just days away, it means it is not just the 32 countries taking part that are fine-tuning their plans, but also the 22 corporate backers.

And according to one Brazilian expert, the big name sponsors are playing a more defensive game than usual.

""There is no disputing that the sponsors are a really important part of the World Cup,"" says Rio de Janeiro-based sports marketing consultant Amir Somoggi.

""However, some of the people and protesters on the streets are trying to put some of the guilt around the World Cup costs onto the sponsors.

""So sponsors are not launching their usual type of marketing strategies in case they are targeted by protesters. They are being slightly cautious, and for me, not being as major a part of the World Cup experience.

""But for me the blame for the increased costs should not be put on Fifa or the sponsors, but our politicians.""

Three-tier structure

The sponsors have paid anything from an estimated £8m to £120m to have their names associated with what is one of the two biggest events in global sport.

And even if they are being more passive then usual, they will be getting their wares and services seen across most of the planet. During the last World Cup in South Africa there were reported to be more than 3.2 billion global TV viewers.

Meanwhile, Fifa has also benefitted. By selling the rights for firms to be associated with the event, it is estimated to make some £850m over a four-year World Cup cycle, making up the majority of its non-TV revenues during such a period.

As was the case in South Africa, Fifa this year is operating three tiers of sponsorship:

a top tier of six premier commercial ""global partners"", who have a global marketing association with all Fifa events

a second tier of eight event ""sponsors"", who have a global association with just the World Cup and the Confederations Cup

a third tier of eight ""local partners"", or ""national supporters"", who have roots in the host country and are allowed to promote an association in the domestic market

Mr Currie says if the sponsor roster was a ""merry-go-round or revolving door of changing names"", firms might question the value of being involved. Rather there is a steady roster of big names staying on board for a number of tournaments.

""When you count the number of renewals you can see the value of the World Cup to big brands - Adidas has signed up for the next four World Cups until 2030, and Visa, Coca-Cola and Hyundai-Kia until 2022,"" says Mr Currie.

Perfect storm?

Nowadays a bigger budget does not necessarily translate into higher reach and impact - creativity plays an enormous role Anastasia Kourovskaia, Millward Brown Optimor

Despite the lower-key approach, the main aim for sponsors will be to persuade football lovers to spend cash on their brands.

According to sports marketing research firm Repucom's World Football Report, which launches on 12 June, during the 2010 event about $4.12bn (£2.46bn) was generated globally for sponsors.

Some $907m of that amount was generated via the final alone.

This year is also expected to see a big increase in brand promotion via social media.

""Digital consumption... will be central to this World Cup. Brazil is also Facebook's second largest market and provides YouTube with its second most unique visitors,"" says Paul Smith, founder and chief executive of Repucom.

""Because of this, we could well see a perfect storm of fan engagement this tournament. Sponsors will of course be positioning themselves to take advantage of this.""

However, she says it is important that brands stop differentiating between online and offline media. ""We live in an increasingly seamless world and successful social media campaigns are seamlessly integrated campaigns."" she says.

She says a McDonald's food box campaign linked to the GOL! App is a good example of a successful integrated campaign.

But she adds that while campaigns have to be integrated, it is also important to understand how each platform works and tailor content to the specifics of each platform.

Looking to individual sponsors, she says Budweiser has plenty of initiatives around the tournament, including a ""Rise as One"" micro-site campaign, use of Twitter cards for voting for Man of the Match, as well as programmes for Instagram and Facebook.

Meanwhile, she also points to Adidas's initiative in providing a football match perspective from the point of view of @Brazuca, its official match ball.

""Cutting through the noise becomes ever more difficult, and if previously this could have been resolved by throwing more money in the pot, unfortunately it is no longer the case,"" says Ms Kourovskaia.

97,"Image copyright PA Image caption Estimating who has the flu has shown up some problems with big data projects

Pick a number between 1 and 100.

Got one? Good. Congratulations. Chances are that by plucking that number out of the ether you have done a better job than Google of predicting the percentage increase in the number of flu-like illnesses that will strike Americans over the next few weeks.

That's right. You, armed only with your puny brain, can outdo a multi-billion dollar corporation that employs some of the smartest people in the world.

This example might seem trivial, but many think it matters because of the status of Google Flu Trends (GFT), once seen as the shining example of the power of so-called big data.

The data it uses to make predictions about how many will be sneezing and wheezing a week or so ahead is drawn from search terms, blog entries and messages shared via social media - so-called unstructured data.

This is very different to the structured and slow stream of information gathered from forms filled in at surgeries and hospitals that, before the rise of big data, were how predictions were made.

And the problem is, GFT turned out not to be terribly accurate.

Often times the only reason why people believe their data is clean is because they have never looked at it Kaiser Fung, Author and statistician

In a run of 108 weeks, GFT wrongly predicted the number of flu cases 100 times, revealed a recent study.

Sometimes its estimate was double the number of actual flu cases recorded by US doctors. Hence the reason anyone can do better by plucking a number out of thin air.

Yet this unstructured data humans put online is exactly the type of stuff that companies want to analyse when they kick off their own big data projects.

Many corporations are keen to use those garbled knots of human sentiment to monitor how their brands are faring online, and to tweak their operations accordingly when they spot commercial opportunities or potential PR disasters.

Before now, those giant data sets had been hard to unpick. GFT seemed to suggest that with the right tools it could unlock all kinds of useful predictions.

Not only that, but those predictions could be uncovered quickly and cheaply.

Dirty data

Why did GFT go so wrong and what implications does this have for other big data projects?

""There's no such thing as clean and stable data,"" said statistician Kaiser Fung who has written extensively about the pitfalls that can dog big data projects.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption There's no such thing as perfectly clean data, argues statistician Kaiser Fung

What he means by ""clean and stable"" is that it is a mistake to think that the data Google gathered for GFT today is the same as it gathered last week, last month or last year.

Google regularly tweaks the algorithms it uses to index online life and, as a result, may be sampling very different things month to month, adding a degree of instability - spots of dirt as it were - to that dataset.

The same is true of any big data set gathered by anyone, he said.

All will be tainted in some way as they will miss out something simply because of the quirks of the underlying code used to parse and index web pages, social media messages and blog posts.

There's a customer backlash about to happen - it's against the big part of big data Patrick James, Ernst & Young

That will be particularly true if companies buy in their data from different sources and then treat it as all one corpus.

""I have never come across a complete data set,"" he said. ""Often times the only reason why people believe their data is clean is because they have never looked at it.""

Companies in possession of a huge corpus of data can assume that all the information they need is in it. Sadly, he said, this ""N=all"" assumption is wrong.

""It is much better to assume that the data has holes and flaws than it is to assume it is complete.""

Any company starting a big data project would do better to look at the data they have gathered and clean it up before any analysis starts.

There are other good reasons for scrutinising that mass of information about customers, says Patrick James, a partner in consultancy Ernst and Young's consumer practice.

""There's a customer backlash about to happen,"" he says. ""It's against the big part of big data.""

More and more people are getting less and less happy about simply surrendering information and getting nothing in return, he maintains.

Increasingly, consumers and customers will attempt to hold back their data, limit what they share online or simply give the wrong answers when they sign up for a service or are quizzed about their life and habits, he believes.

Image caption People are getting more reluctant to share data about who they are and what they are doing

The tens of thousands of people who filled in a form to make Google expunge their data from its index was evidence of that growing desire to disappear, says Mr James.

If this trend grows, it could mean data sets get skewed and become less useful for those big projects.

These early days of big data might prove to be its golden age.

""Data has never been cheaper than it has been today and it's only going to get more expensive,"" says Mr James.

Fast response

So, if data is not the key to a good project, what is?

""Too many big data projects are started by the IT departments in companies that want to play with new technologies like Hadoop,"" says Dr Laurie Miles, head of analytics at big data specialist, SAS.

""That's led to scepticism, because in the history of IT projects a lot of them have been failures.""

Instead of the technology coming first, anyone embarking on a big data project needs to know why they are doing it before they sign off on any expenditure by the IT folks, he argues.

Image copyright Royal Mail Image caption British Rowing has turned to big data to help fine tune coaching of its rowers

""A big data project is not going to deliver any benefit unless you focus on a specific problem.""

That focus can stop a project running away with itself and ensure it produces results that impinge on a real business issue, he says.

Spotting fraudulent credit card use requires a very different approach to analysing the performance of elite rowers - SAS is helping with both.

""We analyse credit card data at the point of sale, and you need that quickly,"" says Dr Miles. ""With British Rowing we have a couple of weeks to to give them answers.""

Football is full of ""what ifs"".

What if the linesman had said that Geoff Hurst's second goal for England in the 1966 World Cup final hadn't actually crossed the line? Would West Germany have won instead, depriving England of its only trophy?

What if Frank Lampard's ludicrously disallowed goal against Germany in 2010 had stood? Would England have gone on to win the match?

Goal-line incidents like these have left exasperated fans - and officials - crying out for technology to come to the rescue.

And although solutions have been used for years in several other sports, this will be the first World Cup to feature goal-line technology (GLT).

It is just one example of how this World Cup promises to be the most hi-tech and interactive yet.

Cameras galore

German company GoalControl has fitted 14 high-speed cameras - seven per goalmouth - to the roof of each of the 12 stadiums.

These are connected to an image-processing computer that filters out non-ball-shaped objects and tracks the ball's position to within a few millimetres, the company says.

When the ball crosses the goal line, the system - which has been thoroughly tested by governing body Fifa - sends a vibration to the referee's watch and the word ""GOAL"" appears on his screen, all in less than a second.

Meanwhile, technology company Sony, which is supporting official Fifa broadcaster HBS, has installed more than 224 high-definition (HD) cameras which will capture more than 2,500 hours of sport during the tournament - more than ever before.

And this will also be the first time some World Cup matches are captured in the ultra-high-definition (UHD) 4K format, which is roughly four times the resolution of current HD TV.

This requires a satellite network capable of handling 100 megabits per second.

While most fans won't yet be capable of receiving a 4K signal, Sony's World Cup programme manager, Mark Grinyer, told the BBC: ""We've proved UHD streaming can work and we're building a 4K archive for Fifa for the first time.""

Connected Cup

Image copyright AFP Image caption The Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will play host to the first ""digital World Cup""

Fans - about three million attending the games and possibly four billion watching on TV - will be viewing, chatting, voting and betting simultaneously on a variety of digital devices, making it a truly multi-screen World Cup.

As the digital audience doubles, there's a tripling in complexity Alex Gibbons, Akamai

""The ways people can watch content has exploded,"" says Alex Gibbons, UK and Ireland vice president for Akamai, the global content delivery network.

""There are more, better connected devices than ever before, and more people watching them.""

Ian Foddering, UK and Ireland chief technology officer for infrastructure specialist Cisco Systems, agrees: ""Two years on from the 2012 London Olympics, user expectations have increased in terms of their experience at such events.

""They now typically have an expectation of ubiquitous, high-speed connectivity enabling them to share exciting moments with the world via social media.""

This presents practical challenges for content providers and IT companies alike.

Record breaker

For example, football app developer, Onefootball, has launched a dedicated free app for the tournament.

Chief executive Lucas von Cranach told the BBC: ""This World Cup is going to break every record in terms of digital traffic and engagement - we're expecting seven digit downloads of our Onefootball Brasil app.""

So how does the company prepare for such high traffic volumes?

""We've built a huge content management system that can cope with major increases in traffic - the load balancing is taken care of by our cloud provider, Amazon Web Services,"" he says. ""We couldn't do what we do without cloud computing.

""But apps crash all the time,"" he admits . ""A lot depends on the connection quality offered by the phone network provider, and that's out of our control.""

Image copyright onefootball Image caption Sports publisher Onefootball expects millions of fans to access its World Cup app

To get some sense of the scale of this digital World Cup, Akamai says it is expecting to handle up to 2.5 million live content streams at any one time across its network.

This compares to 1.6 million during the 2010 World Cup.

And daily peak data traffic could reach 25 terabits per second (Tbps), says Mr Gibbons, up from its usual peak of 15Tbps.

""As the digital audience doubles, there's a tripling in complexity,"" he says.

Odds-on favourite

The implementation and expansion of our wi-fi network has been rapidly accelerated in the last few months Telecoms firm Oi

One activity that is likely to generate big traffic during the World Cup is betting via mobile and online.

According to online payments company Skrill, nearly a third of UK adults intend to place a bet on the 2014 World Cup - nearly half of those will do it online and a quarter via mobile app.

The global value of bets placed using mobile devices is forecast to reach $62bn (£37bn; 46bn euros) by 2018 - a six-fold increase on the 2013 figure, according to Juniper Research.

""Mobile betting is likely to take more money than traditional bookies for the first time [at this tournament],"" says Tom Levey, from app performance management company, AppDynamics.

""It's the first truly digital World Cup.""

The company's online bookie clients will be processing hundreds of bets a second, he says. ""As soon as we see peaks in traffic we advise on when and how to increase capacity. The companies can't afford to crash - minutes matter.""

Image copyright PA Image caption Online betting will play a huge part in the World Cup

But increasing capacity isn't simply a case of plugging in to more cloud-based computer servers, says John Bates, chief marketing and strategy officer at Software AG, an IT services company.

""The biggest problem for service providers is the computational explosion associated with managing billions of transactions every second,"" he says. ""This requires things like streaming analytics and in-memory architecture, and all this has to be done in real time.""

Brazilian backbone

Brazilian telecoms company Oi, an official Fifa partner, has been furiously gearing up for the tournament.

""The implementation and expansion of our wi-fi network has been rapidly accelerated in the last few months,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""We've grown from 78,000 hotspots in April to more than 700,000 now - the largest network in Brazil.""

It has also increased the coverage and capacity of its 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks at key points throughout the tournament cities.

That will be welcome news for visiting fans wanting uninterrupted, high-speed access to their content.

But they should be wary about the cost of all this streaming content and interactivity.

With every 1MB of data costing about £5 in Brazil, unwary England fans who opt out of data limits set by their network providers, could face unexpected bills running into hundreds of pounds over the tournament, price comparison service Uswitch warns.

Shares in online fashion retailer Asos have plunged by 30% after it issued a second profit warning in three months.

The company blamed the strength of the pound, which hurt overseas sales and forced it to launch a series of promotions.

International revenues in the three months to the end of May grew by just 17%, against 48% a year earlier.

Chief executive Nick Robertson admitted the retailer's performance was ""not what we had hoped for"".

The pound has risen 10% in value over the last year.

Asos cut its forecast on profit margins to 4.5% from 6.5% on a sales target of £1bn for the current financial year.

That would imply a fall in profits to £45m from a previous forecast of £65m.

Discounts

Asos, which achieves a high proportion of revenues from womenswear, recently launched a series of promotions.

These normally represent 3% of sales but rose to 8% in its third quarter.

But the discounts were not enough to offset the decline in its overseas sales, which account for 60% of the retailer's total revenues.

Asos warned in March that the costs of new warehousing in the UK and Germany, as well as start-up expenses in China would hit earnings.

Half-year pre-tax profits fell 22% to £20.1m.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Asos is still targeting annual sales of £2.5bn

Mr Robertson said sales in the three months to the end of May were strong, up 25% across the group and 43% in the UK.

But overseas growth has been slowing in each quarter for the past year.

US sales were up 17% compared with 59% a year ago, while sales growth across Europe of 37% compared with a 56% rise a year earlier.

For the rest of the world, sales slowed to a trickle of 1% compared with 38% the year before.

Mr Robertson said the result was a higher proportion of sales came from the UK and Europe, where margins are lower.

Asos, which stands for As Seen on Screen, is targeting annual sales of £2.5bn.

It reported total sales of £754m in its last set of full year results to the end of August 2013 a rise of 40% on the year before.

Its share price soared to 7111p earlier this year, more than doubling the company's value on the year before, but has since slumped amid profit concerns.

Mr Robertson said: ""Whilst our profit performance for this financial year is not what we had hoped for due to an unusual combination of factors, our accelerated investment in technology and infrastructure to support our £2.5bn sales ambition is progressing.

""We are totally focused on rolling out the Asos business model globally as the world's leading online fashion destination for 20-somethings.""",Asos shares sink 30% on second profit warning,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75313000/jpg/_75313292_75313291.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27710190

The size of the Bank's bond-buying economic stimulus programme was also kept unchanged at £375bn.

The decision was widely expected, despite continued signs of strength in the UK economy.

Last month, the Bank of England reiterated it was in no rush to raise rates, with governor Mark Carney saying they may remain low ""for some time"".

However, Mr Carney added the economy had ""edged closer"" to the point where interest rates would need to rise.

Commenting on the bank's announcement, David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""The decision to keep interest rates and quantitative easing on hold was the right one"".

And he added: ""With annual CPI inflation below target, the MPC can afford to wait before tightening their policy. The strong rise in sterling over the past year, making UK exports more expensive, is an important reason for not raising interest rates prematurely"".

Strong growth

Latest official figures show that the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2014.

Recent business surveys have also indicated that the economy is continuing to enjoy strong growth, and the unemployment rate has fallen to a five-year low of 6.8%.

Despite Mr Carney's recent comments, minutes from last month's meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggested some members were softening their stance on raising interest rates.

While all nine MPC members voted to keep rates unchanged, the minutes said the views of some members on raising rates were becoming ""more balanced"".

China's exports grew in May but a drop in imports signalled a possible weakening of demand in the world's second-largest economy.

The country's exports rose by 7% in May compared with 12 months before. But imports fell by 1.6% on a year earlier.

It meant the nation's trade surplus widened sharply to $35.9bn (£21.4bn), from April's $18.5bn, the General Administration of Customs said.

The figures will add to recent concern about the state of the Chinese economy.

It has shown signs of weakness amid poor data from the manufacturing and retail sectors.

'Normal level'

The country's commerce ministry had hoped the trade picture would pick up in May.

Some experts believe the weak trade figures are partly due to an unnatural comparison with last year, when there was a glut of fake invoicing of exports as a way of getting around impending currency restrictions.

There has been a crackdown on such activities since May 2013.

""The data shows that the country's exports growth has returned to a normal level and will continue to improve,"" customs office spokesman Zheng Yuesheng told state television.

Exports to the US were up by 6.3% in May, down from a rise of 12% in April.

Shipments to the EU rose by 13.4%, down from an increase of 15.1% the previous month.

And exports to ASEAN bloc countries rose by 9.1%, up from the figure of 3.8% in April.

Impressively, China accounts for nearly 1 in 10 tourists globally.

This number is set to rise and it shouldn't be surprising since China accounts for one-fifth of the world's population.

Projections are that the 100 million trips taken each year now will double by 2020.

This is with only an estimated 5% of the population holding passports. Though that's already more than the population of Britain.

Still, with 1.3 billion people, there's a lot more potential tourists.

Chinese tourists are already the biggest spenders globally. They outspend the Americans and Germans as well as even the Russians on a per trip basis.

In 2013, Chinese tourists spent over $100 billion (£59.5bn) and they travel to shop.

Some 80% of Chinese tourists view holidays as shopping trips, as compared with about half for those from the Middle East. And they are keen to leave China to do so in order to find lower prices for luxury goods.

'Stubborn' stomachs

CC Zhuang, the chief executive of Qunar, China's largest travel website, says Chinese tourists also leave the country to seek better services in holiday spots.

He says that the Chinese stomach is ""stubborn,"" so travellers will prefer places with good Chinese food as well as local food.

None of this should be surprising given the size and rapid growth of China. What is somewhat astounding is how quickly it's changed.

During the 1990s, my Chinese friends found it difficult to travel abroad. They paid large deposits (ostensibly to ensure their return) to designated travel agents who were authorised to take them on group tours.

Simply booking a ticket and hotel online yourself weren't really options for the average Chinese.

How different it is now.

The growth of Chinese tourism offers an opportunity for other countries seeking to attract big spending visitors.

But, for under-developed Chinese tourist sites that are affected by pollution and lagging services, surely there's a missed opportunity for the Chinese themselves.

The countries of the former Eastern Bloc have totally transformed themselves since the fall of the Iron Curtain 25 years ago, as the BBC's Tanya Beckett reflects - drawing on her own experiences of the region, both then and now.

When I was 14 years old my parents took my brother and me to Romania on holiday. My father was always up for a bargain vacation abroad and it seemed, as they say, like a good idea at the time.

I didn't have much experience of hotels, but this one was awful - drab with a broken shower, and the food was pretty much inedible.

We exchanged our pounds for Romanian lei in clandestine manoeuvres, swapping wads of cash wrapped in napkins back and forth in the hotel.

In the absence of anything else to occupy our time, we managed to find a man teaching windsurfing on the Black Sea.

There was nothing in the shops really, just some ghastly salami

So we spent most of the time wielding a sail in the sun, and becoming pretty proficient in the water, as our parents waved frantically, shouting inaudible instructions from the beach.

The natural beauty of the country must have been a cherished bright spot for Romanians stuck in an otherwise grey and hopeless existence.

There was the odd bit of male attention for an adolescent me, but that was clamped down on pretty quickly by the security police, of whom most people seemed to live in terrible fear.

Beggars on the streets

Romania's Securitate seemed to be everywhere, and that wasn't just in people's minds. It was, as I was later to learn, the largest police force in the whole of communist Europe.

The few Romanians we could talk to described how they wanted to get out of a country where they could not choose their work, and where hope for a better future seemed an impossible prospect.

As part of my brother's and my education, our parents opted for a trip to Bucharest.

It was not the sort of day out you might hope for as a teenager - the capital was grey, and for all that we had been taught about the equality and benefits of communism, the streets were littered with beggars.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A parade in 1970s communist Bucharest

Fencing on bottled water

The experience of the holiday meant that when I studied at university, I found I had little tolerance for the table-banging students who espoused the benefits of communism without actually having understood how it worked in practice, and the despair it wreaked on society.

Whilst a student I went on a fencing trip to Poland. It was a test of survival. We couldn't drink the tap water and the only option we had while we were training was to prise open endless tiny bottles of fizzy water with anything we could find.

There was nothing in the shops really, just some ghastly salami, and the windows were filled with displays of the same item - quite often with those bottles of fizzy water again.

If you expressed a hope that there might be an alternative, you were batted back with not just incredulity, but impatience. Why entertain the prospect of diversity when all it could lead to was frustration?

When we travelled around, we noticed that the Poles had no interest in us at all. It seemed that the weight of their terrible history had expelled every ounce of joy from their souls.

The only escape was the lure of vodka, which we were introduced to on New Year's Eve. I wasn't used to handling spirits and aside from a few rather jolly flashbacks, I remember very little about the festivities at all.

Nostalgia for communism

Last month, decades later, I returned to central and eastern Europe to film some reports on how former communist countries had changed since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The next 25 years will be much more sure-footed than the last

We wanted to capture how some economies had managed to make the transition to market capitalism and how it had affected people's lives.

You can guess that in any society there are those who are driven by the idea of possibility and are happy to take risks, whereas there are others who favour the prospect of security.

The recent roller-coaster ride in the aftermath of the financial crisis has shown just how dangerous rampant capitalism can be, so this was a particularly interesting time to find people in some cases reflecting wistfully on the stability that communism had offered.

The two countries which leapt out at me as being polar opposites were, by coincidence, Romania and Poland. The latter has become a dynamic economy driven by hard working, determined people.

We visited a Fiat factory which was energetic, shiny and new. It looked to be at the cutting edge of how a business with a global perspective should be run. Gone was the pall of grief: it had been replaced by a nation with a uniform sense of purpose.

Romania, which we visited a couple of weeks later, was different entirely - Bucharest embodied a sense of opportunity squandered.

There are terrible cases of poverty, and Romanians are angry that government after government has failed to deliver on the nation's promise.

The next quarter-century

I wondered if the different outcomes had their roots in how their revolutions had taken place - in Poland through a dogged march by the unions, and in Romania a bloody confrontation which masked what was in effect, a coup.

Perhaps the trajectory of their economies since then came down to the political momentum at the start of their transitions.

Surbiton would not normally be thought of as a centre of fashion.

But it is, according to location data analysts at least.

This south west London suburb, home to BBC TV's fictional Stella Street celebrities, is where young people are more likely to check out fashion sites and apps on their smartphones than almost anywhere else in the UK.

The surprising insight comes from mobile phone network EE, which has collated terabytes of anonymised and aggregated data on more than 20 million UK customers - data that is proving increasingly valuable to retailers and advertisers.

The internet has been a godsend for marketers - enabling them to track our online behaviour to the nth degree.

Now location data from mobiles and other sources has added a whole new layer of detail to the picture - a step-change analogous to the move from videotape to DVD.

""Location analytics are becoming integral to every business strategy,"" says David Brussin, chief executive of Monetate, a digital marketing company.

Location analytics is helping to solve that conundrum.

Out-of-home (OOH) advertisers and agencies - those responsible for ads on billboards, bus stops and other physical locations - now know what type of person is passing a specific location at any one time, and what they are doing online.

They can then target their ads accordingly.

""Thanks to location data we now understand the relevance and value of a particular advertising position compared with another,"" says James Davies, chief strategy officer at OOH agency Posterscope.

""For instance, commuters at one station may tend to look at financial apps on their phones, whereas people travelling from another station may prefer fashion apps,"" he says.

""Knowing this helps advertisers ensure their ads are relevant, which saves money and improves effectiveness.""

Image copyright Posterscope Image caption By combining mobile phone location data and online behaviour analysis, firms can pinpoint the best places for their ads

With brands spending nearly £1bn a year on outdoor advertising in the UK, relevance is key to getting more bang for your marketing buck.

Posterscope says its partnership with EE has seen advertising effectiveness triple for some of its clients, who include Lenovo, Nationwide and British Gas.

""We now know which bus stop is better than another on the same street,"" says Mr Davies.

Music for you

The mobile phone is not only an excellent tool for locating consumers, it is also an increasingly effective way for brands to interact with them.

Image caption Joyce DiDonato performs at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in 2013

When people move into a particular zone - crossing a geo-fence as the jargon has it - marketers can send highly targeted offers to their phones - ads relevant to their age, interests and purchasing histories.

For example, during last year's Proms music festival, which centred around South Kensington's Royal Albert Hall, Decca Records sent text messages to classical music lovers in the locality offering them free track downloads of artists featured in that night's programme.

At first, the campaign looked liked proving a damp squib - the geo-fenced area was too narrowly focused around the venue.

Image copyright decca Image caption Location marketing in action: Decca Records offered free classical music tracks to visitors to Proms 2013

But as soon as this was widened to include nearby tube stations, the response rate improved dramatically, the company says.

The campaign illustrated how location analytics could help reach an older demographic that is normally hard to engage, argues Sean O'Connell, director of product and technology at Weve, a joint venture between mobile phone networks Telefonica, Vodafone and EE.

Weve provided Decca's location-based customer data and helps many other businesses with their marketing campaigns. About 60% of its campaigns in 2013 ""included a location element"", says Mr O'Connell.

""The Decca campaign shows how specific and bespoke your marketing can be. And you get much more engagement with this type of marketing - click metrics improve three or four times,"" he says.

Personalised offers

""Location and context aware offers are going to change the world,"" says John Bates, chief marketing strategy officer of big data specialist Software AG.

""Say you're walking past a designer shoe store, you could receive a mobile ad offering a 30% discount off Jimmy Choos if you come in within the next 30 minutes and use a particular credit card.

With location technologies, being able to say no is of paramount importance Sean O'Connell, Weve

""This is how the High Street can fight back against Amazon,"" he adds. ""The real world is fighting back against the virtual world - it's personalisation on a massive scale.""

Monetate's David Brussin agrees, saying: ""A retailer can offer customers a promotion online, via email or on mobile, which changes dynamically based on their location, highlighting the shop physically closest to them and directing them to visit, and ultimately buy.""

But this kind of highly personalised marketing will only work if consumers are happy to trade some privacy in return for the benefits, Mr O'Connell believes.

""All such services are opt-in,"" he says. ""Customers give their permission to be indentified. With location technologies, being able to say no is of paramount importance.""

Smart maps

Location data can also help businesses map out ways to improve - literally.

For example, Esri, a specialist in location data mapping, mashes together all sorts of data - censuses, social media streams, weather, land surveys - then adds in location data gleaned from wi-fi, phone masts, GPS, and card transactions.

Such analysis is helping insurers assess household risk far more accurately, energy companies pick the ideal place for a wind farm, and retailers plan their stores, says Ms Grufferty.

For example, retailer Argos, part of Home Retail Group, used Esri's location mapping expertise to help it decide the best locations for its ""click-and-collect"" centres, based on in-depth analysis of online and in-store customer behaviour and geo-demographics.

The underperforming, badly located stores were jettisoned, while new and existing stores were stocked more efficiently to suit the local clientele.

""Home Retail Group have been long-term users of mapping software and insight,"" says Andrew Stringer, the company's customer and market insight controller.

The extremely wealthy are growing in numbers and entire industries are being created to cater to their desires but where are the individuals who are amassing vast fortunes based and what do we know about them?

Companies and websites are springing up to track and analyse the names, numbers and needs of the mega-wealthy, you can even get a daily update on who today's richest man (it's always a man) is.

So what can we tell from all of this analysis about the wealthy and the kind of world their rise is creating?

The number of billionaires is forecast to grow by 38% to 2,315 in the decade to 2023, according to Knight Frank's annual Wealth Report which is carried out by the research company Wealth Insight.

The crude number of billionaires may not be that high, but the report forecasts growth among those with $30m (£18m) or more, also known as ""Ultra High Net Worth Individuals"", to reach 215,000 by 2023, a rise of 28%.

While the numbers of the super-rich will swell in all regions of the world, the rate of growth in emerging economies is forecast to be much stronger in the coming decade.

Asia, according to the study, will have the most billionaires and the growth will be considerably greater than in North America and Europe. However it is also worth noting that this reflects a larger population in general. Another thing worth noting is that with inflation a billion today is not going to be worth the same as a billion in 10 years' time.

When you break it down country by country, the US is still expected to have the most billionaires in 2023 but China, Russia and India will be racing to catch up with far higher rates of growth.

One surprising result from the research is the number of self-made multi-millionaires far outstrips those who inherited their money or built a fortune on a substantial inheritance, by roughly two to one.

The dilemma for those who make their own fortune is whether to pass their wealth on to their children or to give the bulk of it away.

Multi-billionaire Edward Zhu, who moved to China from the United States two decades ago, says talented people should start from nothing and that is what he wants for his children.

When it comes to gender, almost nine out of 10 of all the individuals worth more than $30m are men.

Dubai's Emirates Airline has cancelled an order for 70 of Airbus's A350 wide-bodied aircraft, the planemaker says.

Airbus said the cancellation had followed ""ongoing discussions with the airline in light of their fleet requirement review"".

In 2007, Emirates placed 50 orders for the A350-900 and 20 for the A350-1000, with deliveries due from 2019.

UK engine maker Rolls-Royce said the cancellation would lead to a £2.6bn hit to its order book.

""While disappointed with this decision, we are confident that the delivery slots which start towards the end of this decade vacated by Emirates will be taken up by other airlines,"" Rolls-Royce said.

A spokesperson for Emirates said the airline was ""reviewing our fleet requirements"".

'Game changing'

Airbus said it was confident that new orders ""in the coming months"" would compensate for the Emirates cancellation.

""There's no impact on the programme as deliveries were scheduled to start at the end of the decade,"" a spokesman said.

In a statement, the company said it was ""very confident"" in its A350 XWB programme, adding that it had 742 firm orders and it expected the order book to continue growing in 2014.

""Interest in the game-changing A350 has always been very high with customers,"" it said.

Airbus added that Emirates had recently ""reiterated its confidence in Airbus products, particularly by praising the A380"".

The airline ordered an extra 50 A380 superjumbo planes at the last Dubai Airshow.

However, investors took the news of the cancelled A350s badly, with Airbus shares closing down more than 3% in Paris. Rolls-Royce shares fell more than 5% in London.

The A350 long-range jet is a competitor to Boeing's 777 and 787 Dreamliner planes. The design of the A350 was changed in 2006 after potential customers were not impressed by the original plans.

Emirates announced it had ordered 150 of Boeing's 777X planes at the Dubai Air Show last year.

Sash Tusa, aerospace and defence analyst at Edison Investment Research, said the move by Emirates was real blow to Airbus, ""with the loss of a 70 A350 wide-body plane order coming just as rival Boeing's 777X has been launched"".

""It gives the unavoidable conclusion that the world's largest and most influential long-haul airline sees the 777X as the wide-bodied twin of the future,"" he said.",Emirates cancels order for 70 Airbus A350s,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75441000/jpg/_75441448_r9yvw24l.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27791448

The UK jobs market continued to improve in the three months to April, although the rate of wage increases slowed sharply, official figures show.

The number of people out of work fell by 161,000 to 2.16 million, bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.6%.

The number of people in work rose by a record 345,000, to 30.5 million, most of which are in full-time employment.

But the quarterly rate of earnings growth, including bonuses, slowed to 0.7% from 1.9% the previous month.

This was largely due to delayed bonus payments, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Excluding bonuses, pay rose by 0.9%.

The total number of people out of work is now at its lowest level for more than five years, with youth unemployment, which covers 16-24 year olds, standing at 853,000.

The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in May fell by 27,400 to 1.09 million, the ONS said.

Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that the government had reached a ""major milestone"" in its long term economic plan, with ""two million new private sector jobs since 2010"".

Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves told the BBC that the slowing rise in wage increases meant that ""even people in work are struggling to make ends meet"".

Signs of strength

The continuing improvement in the jobs market in the three months to April was due mainly to jobs created in the private sector.

Real pay - having increased marginally for a few weeks - is falling again

The number of jobs lost in the public sector was 103,000, but much of this this was down to the reclassification of employees of Lloyds bank from the public to the private sector. Taking out the Lloyds workers, 11,000 jobs were lost in the public sector.

There were 5.4 million people employed in the public sector and 25.1 million in the private sector, up 447,000 on the previous three-month period.

""The rise in employment this month is concentrated in full-time employees, not self-employment, which in the past has been used to 'talk down' the strength of the rise,"" said David Tinsley at BNP Paribas.

""Indeed, there was a sharp fall in the proportion of people working part-time who say they are doing so because they can't find a full-time job, which is one of the Bank of England's favourite metrics of disguised slack.""

Wage 'concern'

Analysts said the ONS figures sent mixed messages to the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.

Pay growth should pick up in coming months, perhaps significantly Chris Williamson, Markit

""Labour market strength is the driving force behind calls for interest rate increases from the Bank of England, sooner rather than later, and today's figures will add fuel to their fire,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First.

""However, wage growth has fallen to 0.7%, versus an expected 1.2%, and this is still a major cause for concern. As a result I am still expecting the Bank to hold policy right through into the second quarter of 2015, mainly courtesy of the lack of real wage increases.""

The inflation rate in the UK currently stands at 1.8%, meaning wages are increasing at a slower rate than prices.

""Weak pay growth and the 'cost of living crisis' remains the Achilles heel of the economic recovery,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

""But it should not be long until we see earnings growth accelerate as the labour market continues to tighten. Pay growth should pick up in coming months, perhaps significantly.""

The figures for unemployment in the three months to April are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 60,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey.

Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has added 650,000 cars - all in Japan - to the recall it issued last year over a defect in passenger airbags.

That takes the number of cars recalled over the issue to 2.79 million.

The affected vehicles have a defective part which ""could cause the airbag inflator to rupture and deploy the airbag abnormally in a crash"".

Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker, said it had received one report of a seat cover burn due to the issue.

It added that it was also modifying the remedy that it was using to address the issue.

Toyota said that it had so far been replacing the part in the affected vehicles based on the serial number provided by the parts maker, Takata Corp.

However, it added, that the serial number in some of the cases was incomplete and had led to those cars not being serviced, despite receiving the initial recall notice.

Toyota said it would now replace the inflator in ""all involved vehicles"", irrespective of the serial numbers.

As a result, it said, it was re-notifying 350,000 owners globally to bring their cars back for servicing.

""For vehicles which were inspected and did not receive a replacement inflator, we will re-notify the owners and replace the inflator with a new one,"" the firm said in a statement.

Inditex, the Spanish owner of fashion retailer Zara, has reported its biggest fall in quarterly profits in five years after a strong euro hurt its earnings in other currencies.

Net profits fell 7.3% to 406m euros ($550m; £327m) in the three months to April, from 438m euros a year ago.

But sales grew 4.3% to 3.75bn euros as consumer spending in its core European market continued to recover.

Imagine you've spent the past few years and a very large sum of money developing new technology which you believe will be a game-changer in your industry.

Do you protect your investment carefully, and make sure your designs are protected by watertight patents - or do you allow your rivals to benefit from your research to boost the market as a whole?

We don't want to cut a path through the jungle and then lay a bunch of landmines behind us Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive

Over the past couple of weeks, Elon Musk, the maverick boss of Tesla Motors, has been dropping some pretty strong hints that he is considering the second option.

The company has created the Model S, an electric car capable of accelerating as fast as a premium sports car such as the Porsche 911, while offering a range of 250 miles between charges. It is widely seen as being ahead of the game in the electric car market.

At Tesla's annual general meeting, Mr Musk said he was surprised that other carmakers had yet to come up with anything similar, and added that he was contemplating doing something ""kind of controversial"" with patents, in order to boost the electric car industry.

In an interview last week, I asked Mr Musk if that meant he was preparing to give technology away. His response was that I was ""on the right lines"".

He told me that there was nothing to be gained from creating technical barriers to the development of electric cars - or as he put it: ""We don't want to cut a path through the jungle and then lay a bunch of landmines behind us.""

Industry differences

Image copyright volvo Image caption Volvo invented the three-point seat belt in 1959 before giving the patent away

If Tesla were to take such a step, it would break new ground in the motor industry.

Carmakers do share some patents, often within joint ventures when they have shared research costs. They frequently license designs to parts manufacturers, usually for a substantial fee. But as a rule, they don't give their ideas away.

The big exception to this rule was Volvo's decision in the early 1960s to give its design for a three-point seatbelt to other manufacturers. But that was a decision taken purely on altruistic grounds, and with no commercial benefit.

In some industries, however, technology sharing is relatively common. In IT, for example, the concept of ""open source"" is well-established. Both software and designs for hardware can be made available under a free licence, allowing people to use, distribute and modify them at will.

The idea is that this promotes collaboration between researchers, promotes faster development, and levels the playing field between small operators and big businesses. It can also lay the foundations for building new markets.

'Free researchers'

The Google-led Android initiative, for example, has created a software platform that anyone can use. As a result, there is now a thriving industry in developing apps for Android devices - not to mention the devices themselves.

One fan of this system is Adrian Bowyer. He founded the RepRap Project - an initiative begun in 2005 which made designs for 3D printers freely available online. He also runs RepRapPro, a company which sells complete 3D printer kits. He says the open source model has been hugely beneficial.

Image copyright RepRapPro Image caption RepRap shared designs for its 3D printers online

""It turns all our customers into developers,"" he says. ""Everybody who buys one of our machines can find out how it works, edit the programmes that control it, and often they send us suggestions for improvements. We have an enormous number of free researchers available.""

The obvious risk is that rivals simply take advantage of the chance to get hold of some free research, but Mr Bowyer says that does not usually happen.

""By and large they don't,"" he says. ""They do take some, but by then we've probably moved on anyway, because it's a fast moving field.""

[Tesla] are market leaders, but they seem to be on the same lap as the rest of the field Jay Nagley, Red Spy automotive consultants

Mobile wars

Yet pitfalls do exist, according to Alex Wilson, a patent lawyer at Powell Gilbert. He says the mobile phone industry offers some examples of both the benefits and the downsides of sharing technology.

In the 1980s, European telecoms firms worked together to create a common platform for mobile phones, pooling their patents to create what ultimately became the global standard, GSM.

""It was extremely successful at driving the technology and getting it adopted around the world,"" says Mr Wilson.

""The problem arose later when it was so successful that all the players involved in the market began fighting over just how much they should pay for the use of those patents.""

Image copyright AP Image caption Apple and Samsung benefited from the common standard created by others but are now protective of their own patents, says Mr Wilson

He thinks the creation of a common standard also allowed late arrivals into the phones market, such as Samsung and Apple, to steal a march on their more established rivals.

""If you look at what has happened to European manufacturers such as Nokia and Ericsson, they have been left behind by larger players who have run with their technology,"" he says.

Now, Apple and Samsung are the dominant players - and both have become extremely protective of the patents they have developed themselves.

Tesla - game changer?

So what of Tesla? A great deal hinges on exactly what technology the company decides to give away. It has already indicated that it will help other manufacturers to adapt their cars to use its network of ""supercharger"" fast-charging stations.

That would make sense, since a lack of charging infrastructure is widely believed to be a factor holding back sales of electric vehicles.

But if it were to offer up the secrets of the Model S, would that be a game-changer for the industry?

""That depends how big an advantage they actually have over other manufacturers,"" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultants Red Spy.

""With the Model S, they seem to have done an impressive job developing existing technology, but they don't seem to have anything that's actually new technology.

China has announced new measures aimed at bolstering its economic growth.

These include plans to build railways, roads and airports along the Yangtze River - which connects China's less developed inland provinces to Shanghai.

Meanwhile, China's central bank said it will encourage banks to lend more to exporters to boost shipments.

The moves, the latest in a series of steps taken in recent weeks, come amid concerns over a slowdown in China's economy - the world's second-largest.

China's economy expanded by 7.4% in the January-to-March period, from a year ago, down from 7.7% growth in the final quarter of last year.

'Economic integration'

After years of robust expansion, China has seen its growth rate slow in recent years, in part due to a slowdown in demand for its exports from key markets.

Better use of the so-called 'golden waterway' can boost economic integration between developed and impoverished regions China's State Cabinet

In an attempt to sustain a high growth rate, and to rebalance its economy, China has been looking to boost domestic consumption.

However, there have been concerns that as China tries to move away from an export-led growth model, growth may slow down further.

Data released earlier this month showed that China's imports declined 1.6% in May, from a year earlier, underlining fears that domestic demand may not be picking up as fast as policymakers had hoped.

At the same time, China's exports have also been under pressure in recent months.

Even though shipments rose 7% in May, they had increased just 0.9% in April and declined sharply in March and February.

On Wednesday, the State Council said that the decision to build a multi-tier transport system along the Yangtze River will help create a new economic belt along the river.

""Better use of the so-called 'golden waterway' can boost economic integration between developed and impoverished regions and inject fresh energy into China's economic growth,"" the State Cabinet was quoted as saying by the state-owned Xinhua news agency.

According to official data, the 11 provinces and municipalities along the river account for almost 41% of China's overall gross domestic product.

Growth boost

China has also announced various other steps to boost growth in recent weeks.

In April, the government said it will cut taxes on small firms and speed up the construction of railway lines across the country.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China has been looking to boost lending to certain sectors

It said it will sell 150bn yuan ($24.6bn; £14.5bn) worth of government bonds to finance the increased investment in railways.

The ratio will be cut by 0.5 percentage points from 16 June.

Banks eligible for the cut include those whose new loans to agriculture-related entities accounted for at least half of their total new lending in the last financial year.

Lenders whose outstanding loans to agriculture-related entities accounted for 30% percent of their total outstanding loans in the last financial year will also be eligible for the cut.

Mr Sikka, a former SAP executive board member, will be the first non-founder to lead Infosys.

He will take charge of the company from 1 August.

Even though the firm reported a jump in revenue and profit for the financial year ending 31 March, there have been concerns about a slowdown in its pace of growth.

George Osborne, in his Mansion House speech, is expected to say how the Bank of England could tackle any financial instability caused by house price rises.

Price expectations

Various surveys have suggested that house prices have been rising in most parts of the country, but particularly in London.

The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found prices rising at an annual rate of 17% in the city, compared with 8% in the UK as a whole.

Mr Cable told the BBC: ""In the short-run, the immediate problem is to stop this boom getting out of control.""

However, last week the Nationwide Building Society said that there had been signs that activity in the UK housing market was starting to ""moderate"".

And the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that the momentum was starting to slow in the housing market, as ""a lack of supply, higher prices, and more prudent lending measures"" were making buyers and sellers more cautious.

Lending

Mr Cable said that banks ""must not throw petrol on the fire"" by giving home loans that ran at high multiples of applicants' incomes, although he pointed out that the ""boom"" was only being seen primarily in the South East of England.

Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), published on Thursday, showed that first-time buyers borrowed an average of 3.42 times their income in April. This was much higher than in the early 1980s, when it was less than twice.

The figure is an average, so there would be cases when it was much higher.

Data shows that the average property price is currently about six times average earnings. About half of mortgages are secured on a single income.

A large chunk of London properties are bought by cash buyers, affecting prices in the city.

Mortgage brokers have claimed that Mr Cable's views are behind the times, owing to recent regulations that ensure tighter affordability checks from lenders.

""The Financial Conduct Authority has just completed the implementation of the biggest set of changes to the mortgage market in 10 years and the lenders are relying very heavily on mortgage affordability,"" said Aaron Strutt, of Trinity Financial.

""Until house prices come down buyers will need more generous income multiples otherwise they will be forced to rent for longer or rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad.""

Some of Mr Cable's views do echo a warning from the International Monetary Fund, which suggested that an acceleration in global house prices from already high levels was threatening economic stability.

Mr Carney may be positioning himself at the vanguard of a hawkish consensus to raise rates early

'Gradual'

He acknowledged there was ""already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike"" from their record low of 0.5%, adding that the decision was ""becoming more balanced"".

Mr Carney emphasised that there was ""no pre-set course"" on when to raise rates. There was more spare capacity in the economy that would need to be used up first, he said.

And he also reiterated that the timing of the first rise was less important than the speed at which subsequent increases were made.

""We expect that eventual increases in Bank rate will be gradual and limited,"" he said.

Speaking at the Mansion House just before Mr Carney, Chancellor George Osborne confirmed plans to give the Bank new powers to prevent the housing market from overheating.

These will include capping the size of mortgage loans compared to income or the value of the house.

The new powers would be given to the Bank's Financial Policy Committee by the end of this Parliament, Mr Osborne said.

He said: ""We saw from the last crisis the dangerous temptations for politicians to leave the punch bowl where it is and keep the party going on for too long.

""I want to make sure that the Bank of England has all the weapons it needs to guard against risks in the housing market.

""I want to protect those who own homes, protect those who aspire to own a home, and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust.""

Too much risk

Mr Osborne also announced reforms to planning laws designed to increase the supply of housing. These should provide permission for up to 200,000 new homes, the government says.

The chancellor said the housing market did not pose an immediate threat to financial stability, but that if left unchecked, it may do so in the future.

He said the risks come from homeowners borrowing too much to pay for their houses. This is a problem not just for the borrowers, but for the banks that lend them the money, he said.

There are concerns that when interest rates rise from their current record lows, many homeowners could struggle with their mortgage repayments.

Earlier on Thursday, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ""appalled"" that some banks had been lending five times a mortgage applicant's income, suggesting a ""stable level"" was up to 3.5 times.

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics found prices rising at an annual rate of 17% in London, compared with 8% in the UK as a whole. This has led to fears that an unsustainable bubble is developing in the housing market.

However, last week the Nationwide Building Society said it had seen signs that house price rises were starting to cool, while the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said momentum in the housing market was beginning to slow.

Mark Carney was headhunted from Canada to be the Governor of the Bank of England.

That is why his speeches are occasionally enlivened with obscure references to ice hockey, moose or, as in Thursday's speech, a rather strained metaphor linking central banking to canoeing.

But it was a much less colourful line in the speech that grabbed the headlines.

The first rate hike ""could happen sooner than markets currently expect"", he said.

Let me translate from Canadian. Everyone has been betting interest rates won't rise this year. They are wrong.

Until Thursday the consensus was that rates would stay at 0.5% for until at least the beginning of next year and possibly longer.

120,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption A strike by platinum miners has contributed to a contraction in the South African economy in the first quarter.

Credit ratings agency Fitch has warned South Africa that its credit rating may be lowered following a five-month platinum strike in the country.

Fitch was followed by Standard & Poor who also downgraded their rating

Fitch changed the country's outlook from stable to negative, citing poor economic prospects and rising public debt.

Its economy contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter, in part because of a fall in platinum production.

However, unions said a platinum miners' wage deal was on the horizon.

A negative outlook can indicate that a country's credit rating could be downgraded. A downgrade can influence a country's borrowing costs, as some investors are restricted from lending to borrowers that do not have a high rating.

The economic contraction in South Africa in the first quarter ""partly reflects the long strike in the platinum sector, but manufacturing output also fell sharply"", Fitch said.

""Following its election victory in May with 62% of the vote, the African National Congress government faces a challenging task to raise the country's growth rate and improve social conditions, which has been made more difficult by the weaker growth performance and deteriorating trends in governance and corruption,"" the firm added.

South Africa's Treasury said that it was committed to the plans laid out in the country's budget.

""We are committed to the fiscal path and expenditure ceiling,"" it said.

""While short-term cyclical factors might cause marginal deviations from targets, we will not deviate from the long term trajectory,"" the Treasury added.

Fitch kept South Africa's credit rating at BBB, but raised concerns about a poor economic growth outlook and persistent budget shortfalls.

Platinum wage deal

On Friday, Joseph Mathunjwa, the leader of the AMCU union, said that a miners' wage deal with the world's top three platinum producers would come soon, raising the prospect of an end to the strike.

""At least there is light at the end of the tunnel, which is not the light of a goods train,"" he told Talk Radio 702.

The latest offer from Lonmin, Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum Holding amounts to an increase of about 20%, or 1,000 rand ($93) a month.

The union and the firms are still negotiating, and need to resolve questions such as whether the pay rise should be over three or five years.

""We are in quite a sensitive stage of trying to resolve this and reach and agreement. We won't do things haphazardly,"" Mr Mathunjwa said.

The strike by up to 80,000 platinum miners has been going on since late January and is the longest in South Africa's history.

Canadian online gaming group Amaya is to buy the owner of Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker for $4.9bn (£2.8bn) in a deal that will make it the world's biggest publicly listed online gambling company.

The deal for Rational Group will be completed by 30 September, Amaya said.

PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker are the world's most popular and profitable online poker brands.

Amaya said it expects the deal will ""expedite the entry of Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker into regulated markets"" in which it already operates, particularly the US.

Online gambling was in effect outlawed in the US until December 2011, when the Department of Justice (DOJ) backed a court decision that said a 1961 law banning interstate sports betting did not apply to other forms of gambling.

Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware offer some form of internet gambling, while eight other states considered legislation last year.

In 2011, federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched a massive crackdown against online poker in the US.

Economic growth for the first three months of the year could be be revised up after official figures showed the construction industry grew by more than expected.

The construction sector grew by 1.5% in the first quarter, more than double the original 0.6% estimated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It means first-quarter economic growth could lift from 0.8% to 0.9%.

That would be the strongest growth since 2010.

The construction sector grew by 1.2% in April compared with the previous month, the ONS added.

But the data also showed new orders fell sharply, dragged down by orders for new public housing which fell by 45.7% - marking the largest fall since records began in 1964.

The ONS said this might be because investment in housing associations was coming from private rather than public sources.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said that taken together with healthy latest manufacturing figures, it pointed to further strong economic growth in the second quarter.

Mr Williamson said it was ""not just a housing market upturn"". While private sector housing activity grew 2.5% in April, there was also a 3.8% upturn in private sector industrial work.

He said signs of a ""booming"" construction sector added to remarks from Bank of England governor Mark Carney on interest rates to suggest that a hike was more likely by the end of the year.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures provided ""mixed news"" but that while construction activity may have slowed from peak levels, its prospects ""look generally bright"".

The figures come as house building shares plunged on Mr Carney's remarks on interest rates and a strong signal that the Bank of England is likely to take action to cool the housing market later this month.",Construction output boost for economy,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75502000/jpg/_75502030_construction.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27830521

General Motors (GM) has recalled more than 500,000 Chevrolet Camaro cars, mostly in North America, after finding a fault with the ignition system.

The car manufacturer said a driver's knee could bump the key fob and turn it out of the ""run"" position, causing a loss of power.

GM said the fault had led to three crashes, causing four ""minor"" injuries.

In March, GM recalled 2.6 million small cars because of a faulty ignition switch linked to 13 deaths.

Analysis General Motors has recalled more cars than it sold last year. But while the American car giant is responsible for the lion's share of recalls, it is not the only one. Industry wide, recalls are up. Consider this. It's been reported that one in 10 cars and trucks on US roads have been recalled. Given that, it is perhaps less surprising to learn that GM, Ford and Nissan have each recalled more vehicles than they did all of last year. What is unexpected is the reaction among car buyers. It is unclear if they have become desensitised to the recalls or if it is actually helping to drive demand. Either way, US car sales rose in May as US drivers continued to pack into showrooms. Even GM saw a 13% bump in sales compared to the previous year.

In May, the company was fined $35m (£21m) for failing to address different defects which have been linked to 13 deaths.

GM has recalled more than 13 million cars in the US this year - more than the carmaker sold in 2013.

In addition to the Camaro recall, GM also announced it was recalling 28,789 Saab 9-3 convertibles from the 2004-2011 because of concerns over front seat belt failures and 21,567 Chevrolet Sonic cars from 2012, because of concerns over a transmission fault.

The carmaker is also recalling 14,765 of its 2014 Buicks, because of fears over an electrical wiring fault.

Previous recalls have involved possible faulty seat belts, transmissions and air bags, as well as potential fire issues.

The number of days taken off work through sickness is at a record low, says industry body the EEF.

The survey of 330 firms over the past two years showed overall levels of absence reached a record low of 2.1%, equal to 4.9 days per worker per year.

However, employers reported a rise in workers with mental health problems.

The EEF statement said this ""possibly reflects, for the first time, evidence of the effect on employees of the long period of recession and austerity"".

Although short-term absences have fallen, long-term illnesses have risen.

It also says the government's flagship ""fit note"" programme is failing to do what it is designed to do - to get people back to work.

The EEF says manufacturers are increasingly investing in absence management and paying for treatment.

The EEF says this reflects to some extent the fact that short term absence is better managed.

Professor Sayeed Khan, chief medical adviser at the EEF, said: ""Driving down absence rates, helping more employees return to work earlier and, encouraging their wellbeing is critical for our economy.

127,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Bank of England's quarterly bulletin says productivity is well below pre-crisis levels

The Bank of England says productivity is 16% below its pre-crisis trend - but says it is at a loss to understand why.

Its latest quarterly bulletin says that since the onset of the 2007-08 financial crisis, labour productivity in the UK has been exceptionally weak.

It records some ""modest"" improvements in 2013.

However, it says even taking into account possible measurement issues, this shortfall is large and is often called the ""productivity puzzle"".

Interest rates

Measures of productivity, essentially the quantity of goods and services produced per worker or per hour, can be used to inform estimates of an economy's ability to grow without generating too much inflation.

It is an important factor for the Bank of England to consider when making interest rate decisions as it helps it to forecast inflation.

The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, warned last week that interest rates would rise sooner than expected, a move that assumes post-crisis slack is being taken up.

The UK is known to be less productive than other similar developed countries.

Earlier this month the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said poor productivity in the UK was a key risk to future economic health, along with a housing market that is overheating in some areas.

The UK has seen an improvement in output, but productivity has failed to rise in tandem - creating the ""productivity gap"" - and is below that of other developed countries.

British workers now produce about a fifth less for every hour worked than other leading G7 nations.

Anthony Reuben, BBC head of statistics, writes:

To measure productivity, you take the amount of goods and services produced in the economy and divide it by the number of hours worked.

At the moment, the UK's productivity is pretty low compared with its competitors.

Productivity can be a tricky thing to measure across a whole economy. If you have a factory that employs 10 people and makes 100 widgets a day, it's pretty easy to work out the staff's productivity. But what about a hospital or a job centre?

It is important because some analysts attribute the lack of real growth in wages in the UK to the country's low productivity.

Shortfall

The Bank says a key challenge has been to understand better how much of the weakness in productivity has been due to weak demand compared with problems generated by the financial crisis.

It says one reason for the fall is that during the initial phases of the recession, companies appear to have kept on workers, despite a fall in demand.

A more extreme example of this is that firms which are really struggling are being kept afloat by their banks, so called Zombie firms.

But there remains a large degree of uncertainty around any interpretation of the weakness in productivity.

In its May 2014 inflation report, the Bank predicted productivity growth would pick up gradually as the recovery progressed, but said it would still remain ""well below"" its pre-crisis trend.",Bank of England 'puzzled' by productivity gap,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75537000/jpg/_75537914_004488203-1.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27857472

However it expects 3% growth in 2015.

It also said the US should increase its minimum wage to help address its 15% poverty rate.

The recovery from the great recession is a lot more advanced in the US than in many other developed economies. Even so, the IMF sees some important weaknesses. It calls for a catalogue of measures to boost what it calls the modest prospects for productivity growth. Job growth, it says has been healthy, but the labour market is weaker than is suggested by the headline numbers for people out of work. Long-term unemployment is high and many people are not even seeking work, which means they don't register in the official jobless numbers. Wages are stagnant and poverty is stuck at more than 15%. Seven years on from the onset of the financial crisis, the scars on the wider US economy - never mind some European countries - have still not really healed.

The UK cruise market is worth billions to the economy and provides around 70,000 jobs, growing so much over the last year that the UK market is now the biggest in Europe.

The latest figures from the industry association Cruise Lines International show that an extra 25,000 Brits hopped on board a cruise liner last year, taking the total passenger number to over 1.7 million.

That helped the sector contribute more than £2.5bn to the UK economy and create more than 4,000 new jobs.

Not many people investing money in a pension or crowdfunding a project would consider they are participating in something as sinister-sounding as shadow banking.

However, as banks cut lending and businesses look for other ways to find the money they need, this area of finance is growing and attracting the attention of the government.

But what exactly is shadow banking?

""Shadow banking is effectively borrowing and lending outside the regulated banking sector,"" says Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers.

""It runs from quite sophisticated borrowing and lending by banks and other investors and runs through to activities that are new, such as crowdfunding.""

Shrinking banks

""Interconnections"" between this market and banks can mean a problem from one can spill into another, says Gillian Tett, assistant editor at the Financial Times newspaper, who spoke to Radio 4.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gillian Tett, assistant editor of the Financial Times, explains shadow banking.

""When you have shadow banks pumping out a lot of credit into the economy through all sorts of shadowy ways, that means that you can get bubbles developing which are even bigger than people might have realised, and some people think that's happening again,"" she says.

It's a growth area, partly because of a retreat in bank lending, as banks are subject to more regulation.

Image copyright PA Image caption Shadow lending will be monitored more closely, says the Bank of England's Mark Carney

""Part of the growth is because banks' balance sheets shrank,"" says Ian Tyler, partner at accountants Deloitte.

Private equity companies have bought some bank assets, while other lenders include pension funds, insurers and crowdfunding firms, he says. They ask the public for money that could buy a stake in a company, a return or perhaps just goodwill.

We are taking up what was always a natural thing for us to do Paul Stanworth, Managing Director of L&G Capital

""Tighter regulation""

Labour MP and former minister Michael Meacher agrees that constrained lending from banks is a cause of growth in shadow banking. He thinks the more secretive institutions in finance could be the root of the problem, and that secretiveness could hide trouble.

""It's much less safe because hedge funds, for instance, are much less transparent, so problems could emerge we don't know very much about,"" says Mr Meacher.

Another area, he says, is derivatives - bets placed by or for financial companies on how a market may perform in the future. These may be used for anything from creating a fixed-interest mortgage to insuring against a firm defaulting on its debts.

""Regulation needs to be tighter. In 2009, the G20 met in London and this area is one they tried to tackle. They wanted more derivatives traded over exchanges. Very little has happened. This problem needs international attention, and rapidly,"" he adds.

Image caption Regulators have been interested in non-bank lending since at least 2009

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has called for more regulation in the shadow banking market. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Carney said more rules for banks have meant more lending from other firms, which have fewer constraints.

The Financial Stability Board, an international group of regulators and central bankers, estimates the shadow banking market to have grown by about $5 trillion (£2.9tn) to $71tn (£42tn) in 2012.

Not all parts of non-bank lending deserve this suspicion, says Deborah Zurkow, head of infrastructure debt at Allianz Global Investors, which manages investments for pension funds and insurers.

Longer term

""Maybe the reason terms like that [shadow banking] get used is because, when a market is dominated by one funding source over time, people then assume that is the only funding source appropriate,"" she says.

Her firm helps fund projects such as electricity and water networks and her clients want to make long-term investments.

It is less risky too, because unlike depositors, who may want to make a withdrawal at some point, her investors want to make longer-term deals. It can be a much better option than buying government bonds, she says, which can offer less than 3% returns, assuming they are happy with the nature of the risk.

You are seeing all the regulatory bodies around the world looking at this Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at PwC

Paul Stanworth is managing director of L&G Capital, part of insurance giant Legal & General. He helps manage £45bn of assets that help pay pension annuities. About 2-3% of that portfolio is accounted for by loans that his firm makes to owners of property such as commercial premises or office blocks, typically for 15 years or more.

""[Shadow banking] is not a term that should apply to us,"" he says.

Banks attract short-term deposits, unlike pension funds and insurers who receive savings and premiums over a longer period until they are drawn in retirement, making the match with longer loans a better one, he says.

'Core business'

""We are taking up what was always a natural thing for us to do.""

Being an insurance company means sharing the same regulator as banks, too, he says - the Bank of England.

""We think [insurers lending] is a business that will be around and become a core business,"" he says. The company could move into lending to small and medium-sized businesses, albeit cautiously, he says.

They may offer loans as part of a pool of lenders, including banks, in order to spread the risk, he adds.

More regulation is certainly on the cards, says PwC's Mr Burrowes, and in some areas, we are already seeing it.

Banks from 2019 are likely to have their retail operations, used by the public, separated from their riskier operations, in a process dubbed ""ring fencing"".

German firm Siemens and Japanese engineering giant Mitsubishi have come up with a fresh offer for Alstom.

The companies are bidding against US firm General Electric, which also wants to acquire the French firm's assets.

Siemens wants to buy Alstom's gas turbines business, while Mitsubishi has proposed three joint ventures with Alstom and a 10% stake in the company.

The offer includes 3.1bn euros in cash. Siemens is offering 3.9bn euros (£3.1bn) for the gas business.

General Electric (GE) has offered $16.9bn (£10bn) for Alstom's energy business.

Siemens also plans to discuss the possibility of creating a combined rail business with Alstom, which makes the high-speed TGV trains.

All three businesses have been courting the French government over a possible deal.

Both GE and Siemens have made pledges on jobs, with both parties promising to create 1,000 jobs.

Siemens has promised no job cuts in either Germany or France for three years after the deal is completed.

Siemens also said it would headquarter the gas turbines business in France.

'Strategic'

Siemens and Mitsubishi are meeting the French President, Francois Hollande, on Tuesday.

The French government can block foreign takeover bids for companies deemed ""strategic"", and has made job preservation a priority at Alstom. The company is one of France's key industrial firms.

The US Supreme Court has delivered a double blow to Argentina over its long-running battle with holders of the country's defaulted bonds.

First, the court on Monday rejected Argentina's appeal against an order to pay more than $1.3bn to hedge funds that hold some of the bonds.

Then, bondholders won the right to use US courts to force Argentina to reveal where it owns assets around the world.

The country's main stock market tumbled more than 6% at the start of trading.

The court's decision means that bondholders should find it easier to collect on their debts.

But President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner went on national television to say her country couldn't afford to honour the ruling.

She said her government was willing to discuss the issue further, but added: ""What I cannot do as president is submit the country to such extortion.""

However, Anna Gelpern, an expert in sovereign finance at the US-based Georgetown Law School. said: ""This realistically is the end of the road for Argentina's decade-long fight.""

The South American country defaulted in 2001 following its economic crisis, and has been in a legal battle with bondholders led by hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management.

'Slap'

Argentina argues the funds bought most of the debt at a deep discount after the default, and has since tried to impede the country's efforts to restructure.

Investors holding more than 92% of the defaulted debt agreed in 2005 and 2010 to write off two-thirds of their pre-crisis value, providing Argentina with time to re-build its economy.

But the hedge funds held out against the restructuring.

Sebastian Centurion, economist at ABC Exchange, told the Reuters news agency: ""It's a slap in the face. The truth is that this is surprising because it is giving a precedent for any 'vulture fund' to go against any country, so any country is vulnerable in a restructure, so this is bad news for other countries.""

Argentina has said that forcing it to pay the money demanded by the bondholders could threaten its economy.

Siobhan Morden, head of Latin American strategy at Jeffries, said she hoped there will be a willingness on both sides to negotiate a compromise.

General Motors (GM) is recalling 3.16 million more cars in the US because of ignition switch problems, and will change or replace keys on the cars, which date from 2000 to 2014.

Switches can move out of the run position if cars are jarred, and disable power steering.

Last week GM recalled more than 500,000 Chevrolet Camaro cars after finding a fault with its ignition system.

In March, it recalled 2.6 million cars because of a faulty ignition switch.

Braking issues

GM says it is aware of eight crashes and six injuries related to the latest recall.

A company statement said: ""If the ignition switch moves out of the 'run' position, there is an effect on power steering and power braking.

""In addition, the timing of the key movement out of the 'run' position, relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of the crash event, may result in the air bags not deploying.""

The company has now also raised its expected second-quarter charge for recall expenses to $700m, up from $400m.

In May, the company was fined $35m (£21m) for failing to address defects which have been linked to 13 deaths.

GM has now recalled more than 17 million cars in the US this year - more than the carmaker sold in 2013.

Upon completion, the European firm's stake in Woodside will be reduced from its current 23.1% to 4.5%.

Shell has said in a statement it wants to focus its ""Australian growth in directly owned assets.""

Earlier this year Shell reported a 44% drop in first-quarter profits after it wrote down the value of refineries in Asia and Europe.

Share transactions

The cutting of its Woodside stake will take place over two stages.

Shell will offload a 9.5% stake or 78.3 million Woodside shares to institutional investors, at a price of $41.35 Australian dollars per share, by Wednesday.

It will also be selling another 78.3 million shares to Woodside in a buyback programme, at $36.49 Australian dollars per share.

The buyback is subjected to approval by Woodside's shareholders, as well as independent expert opinion that the transaction is ""fair and reasonable"" to all Woodside shareholders.

Foreign investment in China fell in May to its lowest level in 16 months, partly due to slowing growth.

The government says China attracted $8.6bn (£5.1bn) in foreign direct investment (FDI) in May.

That is a 6.7% fall from the same period last year and marks China's weakest FDI report since January 2013.

Economists say prospects of slower growth in the world's second-largest economy may have deterred foreign investors.

China's economy expanded at the pace of 7.4% in the first three months of this year, down from 7.7% growth in the previous quarter.

Earlier this year, Premier Li Keqiang set a target of about 7.5% growth for 2014.

China's GDP growth has been falling since 2010, when it stood at 10.4%.

FDI includes greenfield investment projects, such as newly built factories, as well as mergers and acquisitions.

And the monthly FDI figures can fluctuate as individual investment projects are announced.

The FDI data comes as Mr Li is in the UK on a three-day visit, looking to drum up more investment from the UK.

Domestic boost

To counter the reliance on foreign investment and external factors for growth, China has also been looking to pursue economic growth at home by boosting its infrastructure.

Earlier this month, the State Council said China would build a multi-tier transport system along the Yangtze River, to help create a new economic belt.

China says it wants to back major UK infrastructure projects and has signed £14bn in trade deals.

The news comes on the first full day of a visit by its leader.

The BBC understands the projects the state-owned China Development Bank (CDB) wants to invest in include High Speed 2 and the next generation of nuclear power stations.

A major deal between BP and China National Offshore Oil Corporation is worth about $20bn (£11.8bn).

That will run over 20 years.

CDB has signed a memorandum of understanding with TheCityUK.

The agreement will encourage CDB lending in the UK as well as trading in China's currency, the renminbi, which will open up trade opportunities in China to British businesses.

The memorandum is part of the announcements made by David Cameron and Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday afternoon on closer Sino-UK commercial relations.

The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said: ""The UK is the most popular destination in Europe for Chinese investment with more Chinese investment into the United Kingdom in the last eighteen months than the whole of the last thirty years combined.""

London deal

The memorandum has been brokered by Sir Gerry Grimstone, chairman of TheCityUK.

The oil giant will supply its Chinese peer with liquefied natural gas (LNG), BP chief executive Bob Dudley said at a conference in Moscow.

Mr Dudley said the deal would be signed in London.

""It is a 20-year supply agreement on LNG. It is a fair price for them and a fair price for us. It is a good bridge between the UK and China in terms of trade,"" Mr Dudley said.

BP already supplies CNOOC with LNG from Indonesia.

Meanwhile, the UK's MAP Environmental and and China's ZN Shine Solar have entered into a joint venture to purchase, develop, and manage £400m of UK solar panel assets.

The project will involve a three year construction programme in conjunction with some of the UK's largest engineering and construction contractors.

High Speed 2

Sir Gerry said that his discussions with CDB on Tuesday morning revealed that they were focused on three specific sectors.

""They are interested in nuclear, high speed rail and telecommunications,"" he said. ""High Speed 2 was one of the things they specifically mentioned [in the meeting this morning]. Knowing the finance is available is an important part of any project. This is an important development.""

This is not a one-way street and backers of Chinese money coming into the UK point out that CDB and others are simply looking for sustainable returns rather than political influence

Despite the political controversy surrounding the £42.6bn HS2 project, CDB's position will be a welcome boost for supporters of the line.

Downing Street has previously insisted the route will be wholly funded by the taxpayer, but a large investor could come in to run the service or to build stations and ancillary connecting services. The first part of the 250mph line to Birmingham is due to open in 2026.

Premier Li offered direct help to build HS2 during Mr Cameron's visit to China last December. That offer, which came as surprise to Number 10, was quickly followed by China Railway Group, a subsidiary of the state owned China Railway Engineering Corporation, saying that it could also help with construction projects connected to HS2.

""HS2 could be an attractive investment opportunity,"" said Sir Gerry, who is also the chairman of pension provider, Standard Life. ""This is not some wishy-washy diplomatic gesture.""

""Soft power""

CDB is one of the biggest players in infrastructure development loans worldwide and is seen as an arm of Beijing's economic development policy as well as an extension of the country's ""soft power"" around the globe.

Sir Gerry describes it as the ""trillion-dollar bank"" and it spends billions of pounds every year supporting projects, particularly across Asia and Africa. CDB is now looking to extend its influence, and that of China, into Europe.

They are not alone. The Bank of China also announced a memorandum of understanding with the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday to increase its presence in the City.

Lower fares for flights helped to push the rate of inflation down to its lowest level in four-and-a-half years in May.

The Consumer Prices Index fell to 1.5% in May compared with 1.8% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.

It is the sixth consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target.

A fall in food prices also helped drive down the rate of inflation.

The ONS said the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.6% year-on-year in May, the sharpest fall in a decade.

Falls in the price of everyday basics such as bread, cereals and vegetables drove the drop.

The rate of inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) fell to 2.4% in May from 2.5% in April.

Prices, however, are still increasing faster than average earnings, which rose 0.7% in the three months to April.

The ONS said the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year, was likely to have had an impact on the rate of inflation, particularly on travel costs, which rose sharply to coincide with the Easter holiday.

Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that UK house prices leapt by 9.9% in the 12 months to April to reach a new high of £260,000.

'Feeling the squeeze'

Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company, World First, said the bigger-than-expected fall in the rate of inflation meant there was no rush for the Bank of England to raise interest rates.

""There is pressure on Mark Carney and the rest of the MPC to hike rates on the back of growth and housing market concerns, but given their central mandate of price stability, there is little cause to alter the current policy as it stands,"" he said.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European Economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected inflation to remain below 2% for the rest of the year and ""very possibly beyond"".

House price increases accelerated in April, rising by 9.9% compared with the same month a year ago, according to official figures.

The typical price of £260,000 grew at the fastest rate for nearly four years.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said prices rose strongly across the UK, with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all picking up pace.

London, where prices were up 18.7%, remains the driving force behind the housing revival.

But excluding London and the South East of England, the cost of a home was still 6.3% higher than 12 months before.

The governor of the Bank of England said he would take prompt action, if action was needed.

Writing in the Bank's annual report, Mark Carney said: ""We will not hesitate to take further proportionate and graduated action as warranted,"" Carney said. He added that the Bank's Financial Policy Committee, which is meeting today, had announced measures in November to reduce stimulus to the housing market.""

Other surveys

In March, the ONS calculated that the annual rate of increase had fallen back slightly to 8%, so the April figures shows the market accelerating once again.

April house price inflation was 10.4% in England, 3.3% in Wales, 4.8% in Scotland and 2.6% in Northern Ireland - all higher than the previous month.

First-time buyers continue to experience more rapid price increases than people moving house.

Business correspondent Andy Verity writes:

A rise in London house prices of 18.7% in the year to April is more than 20 times as fast as the average rise in pay (up 0.9%). Even if you strip out London and the south-east of England, prices nationally are up 6.3%.

We need a reliable measure of what house price inflation is doing to the cost of living. Do we have it? Not exactly. The ONS leaves housing costs out of its Consumer Price Index on the grounds that a house is an asset, not something you consume. But for many people - especially younger people - housing costs are by far their biggest single cost.

The ONS answer until now has been to produce another statistic, CPIH, which includes housing costs. Yet, even as house prices roared away, CPIH didn't rise but actually dropped, from 1.6% to 1.4%.

How? Because it measures owner-occupiers' housing costs by looking at what they would pay if they rented. Not the mortgages people actually pay. And the numbers assume that housing costs make up just 15% of the average expenditure.

But ask young people whether they spend just 15% on housing - and you'll get a funny look. Many older people may have paid off their mortgages. The statistics mask gaping differences between the generations. Perhaps younger people could use an alternative measure of the cost of living that reflects their reality - where housing costs are by far the biggest burden.

'Trapped'

Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Each rise in prices means more people stuck living in their childhood bedrooms, or trapped in the cycle of moving from one expensive rented home to the next.

""This is a problem that the government can fix. We need a new generation of quality part-buy, part-rent homes, and to make sure that small builders can get hold of the land and finance necessary to build them.

The ONS reports its figures a month later than other organisations, though the calculation is based on the widest sample of mortgages.

The Halifax has already estimated May's year-on-year increase at 8.7%.

The Nationwide building society said May saw an annual rise of more than 11%, although it suggested that the market might be coming off the boil.

Last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to give the Bank of England the power to impose a cap on home loans related to income or the value of the house.

At present, the Bank can advise on such a cap, but not impose it. The new power should be in place before the end of this Parliament in 2015, the chancellor said.",UK house prices 'rise 9.9% in a year',http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74969000/jpg/_74969117_ef7ml0i5.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27885185

""Crash for cash"" car insurance scams rose by 51% last year, according to one of the UK's biggest motor insurers.

Aviva, which insures one in 10 of the cars in the UK, detected about 820 ""induced accidents"" in 2013.

These faked accidents led to around 2,200 fraudulent claims for personal injury, according to Aviva.

It is calling for harsher sentences for the fraudsters, complaining that the most common punishment is a community order.

Typically, the accidents are caused deliberately by gangs who put in claims for whiplash compensation.

Aviva says that the number of suspicious accidents is likely to be much higher than the hundreds its fraud team has discovered.

The cost of the compensation is borne by honest motor insurance customers through increased premiums.

The company has issued a video showing one crash-for-cash incident, filmed by a camera installed in its customer's vehicle.

Two drivers in front stop suddenly, forcing the car behind to crash into the rear of one of the vehicles.

It is thought that a growing crackdown on speculative whiplash claims is prompting criminals to create real accidents, where they can point to more convincing evidence.

Insurers are sharing information on claimants and working more closely with police.

Aviva says that the risk of motorists being killed as a result of induced accidents is increasing.

The company is dealing with more than 6,000 suspicious injury claims of various kinds linked to known fraud rings.

It followed talks with President Francois Hollande, when the firms were reportedly told to improve the offer.

The companies are bidding against US firm General Electric, which also wants to acquire the French company's assets.

Talks with all the parties are expected to continue over the next few days.

Siemens would pay 3.9bn euros (£3.1bn) for the gas turbine arm, while Mitsubishi would buy 10% of Alstom and inject 3.1bn euros into the company.

General Electric has offered $16.9bn (£10bn) for Alstom's energy business.

Siemens also plans to discuss the possibility of creating a combined rail business with Alstom, which makes the high-speed TGV trains.

After the talks with Mr Hollande, Mr Kaeser was asked whether bid terms would be raised. ""There is no reason for us to discuss that question at this time,"" he said.

There are fears in France that the bid battle will end with the break-up of Alstom and the loss of jobs.

All the bidders have pledged job creation and investment, but Reuters news agency reported that during the meeting with Mr Hollande, the Siemens-Mitsubishi delegation was told that the ""terms must be improved"".

One of the world's biggest lenders, the state owned China Development Bank, wants to become a significant backer of Britain's major infrastructure projects.

China Development Bank (CDB) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chinese government and I have been told that it wants to directly fund two major (and controversial) project areas in the UK - High Speed 2 and the next generation of nuclear power stations.

CDB has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the City via the representative body, The CityUK. The MoU will encourage CDB lending in the UK as well as trading in China's currency, the renminbi, which will open up trade opportunities in China to British businesses.

The MoU will be part of the announcements made by David Cameron and Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday afternoon on closer Sino-UK commercial relations.

The memorandum has been brokered by Sir Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of The CityUK. Speaking to me earlier today, Sir Gerry said that his discussions with CDB this morning revealed that they were focused on three specific sectors.

""They are interested in nuclear, high speed rail and telecommunications,"" he said. ""High Speed 2 was one of the things they specifically mentioned [in the meeting this morning]. Knowing the finance is available is an important part of any project. This is an important development.""

Despite the political controversy surrounding the £42.6bn HS2 project, CDB's position will be a welcome boost for supporters of the line.

Downing Street has previously insisted the route will be wholly funded by the tax payer, but a large investor could come in to run the service or to build stations and ancillary connecting services. The first part of the 250mph line to Birmingham is due to open in 2026.

Premier Li offered direct help to build HS2 during Mr Cameron's visit to China last December. That offer, which came as surprise to Number 10, was quickly followed by China Railway Group, a subsidiary of the state owned China Railway Engineering Corporation, saying that it could also help with construction projects connected to HS2.

""HS2 could be an attractive investment opportunity,"" Sir Gerry, who is also the chairman of pension provider, Standard Life, said. ""This is not some wishy-washy diplomatic gesture.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Premier Li Keqiang's London visit is likely to boost bilateral trade

'Trillion dollar bank'

CDB is one of the biggest players in infrastructure development loans worldwide and is seen as an arm of Beijing's economic development policy as well as an extension of the country's ""soft power"" around the globe.

Sir Gerry describes it as the ""trillion dollar bank"" and it spends billions of pounds every year supporting projects, particularly across Asia and Africa. CDB is now looking to extend its influence, and that of China, into Europe.

They are not alone. The Bank of China also announced a Memorandum of Understanding with the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday to increase its presence in the City.

On Wednesday another state-backed giant, China Construction Bank, is expected to be confirmed as the first Chinese clearing bank designated for offshore renminbi trading in London - a shot in the arm for the City's aspirations to be the major centre outside Hong Kong for dealing in the currency.

Critics will raise questions. With a budget surplus of $200bn and Western governments desperate for foreign capital following the financial crisis, China is in a powerful position.

How it uses that power is yet to be seen but having a huge pile of cash readily to hand is clearly helpful.

Britain remaining as a member of the European Union, for example, is an important issue for Chinese investors. Sir Gerry said that CDB saw London as a ""gateway to Europe"".

Support for HS2 might be politically controversial, but many will argue that China's nuclear aspirations raise even more serious issues. UK government sources have made it clear to me that although they support linking with China on new nuclear power stations, they are well aware of the security risks and political sensitivities.

China is already a minority partner in EDF's plans to build a new nuclear station at Hinkley Point and George Osborne made it clear during his visit to China last autumn that he wanted that relationship to go further. China wholly owning and operating new nuclear power stations has not been ruled out.

This is not a one way street and backers of Chinese money coming into the UK point out that CDB and others are simply looking for sustainable returns rather than political influence.

Frankly, the UK also needs the money, supporters say, and partners for other infrastructure investors such as Legal & General.

Regional free trade agreements opening up parts of China to British firms will also be signed today - a sort of quid pro quo.

""This works both ways,"" Sir Gerry said.

UK supermarket chain Morrisons plans to cut 2,600 jobs as a result of changes to its management structure.

The firm, which has 126,000 staff, will reduce layers of management, it said.

Dalton Philips, Morrisons' chief executive, said the changes would ""lead to simpler, smarter ways of working"".

The former chairman, Sir Ken Morrison, told the BBC that the announcement was ""very disappointing"" and that a more hands-on approach was needed.

""Shop in your own shop, talk to customers and don't make presidential visits - go as an ordinary member of the public,"" he said.

Earlier this month he also attacked the chief executive at the company's annual meeting, telling shareholders he thought the results were ""disastrous"".

Morrisons said it had tried out the new structure and that it led to better performance.

Mr Philips said: ""This is the right time to modernise the way our stores are managed. These changes will improve our focus on customers and lead to simpler, smarter ways of working.""

The roles at risk include department manager and supervisory positions in stores, says the company.

Consultation period

The supermarket will also create 1,000 jobs in Morrisons M local convenience stores and 3,000 in new supermarkets. Morrisons will ""look to offer displaced colleagues the opportunity to work in these growing businesses"", it said.

Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw's national officer representing Morrisons workers, said: ""The next few weeks will be a worrying time for our members in Morrisons and we will do everything possible to support them. Today marks the start of a 45-day consultation period, where we will look in detail at the company's business case.

""Our priority will be to safeguard as many jobs as possible, maximise employment within the business and get the best possible outcome for our members affected by this restructuring.""

The changes come amid increasing pressure on Mr Philips after the Bradford-based chain posted an annual loss of £176m in the year to February and recently announced a 7.1% drop in quarterly sales.

The supermarket has already announced £1bn in price cuts over three years, launched an online operation, expanded its presence in the convenience store sector and moved to update antiquated IT systems.

It is not the only supermarket struggling. In March, Sainsbury's reported its first fall in sales for nine years.

Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King said the supermarket had continued to invest in reducing prices and improving quality in a ""challenging market"".

The big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - are being squeezed by low-cost rivals such as Aldi and Lidl, as well as upmarket chains such as Waitrose.

There are few companies in the country more concerned about their security than De La Rue. This, after all, is a firm with a licence to print money.

In fact, it has lots of licences to print a dizzying array of money, from dozens of countries around the world.

Behind the walls of an unspectacular, but well-guarded building, stand machines that keep many of the world's economies ticking over, working 24 hours a day to print notes.

If you've ever wondered where the money tree grows, then worry no more - I've found it - although it's a factory rather than a tree and powered by machines and high-cost ink, rather than magic.

It is little wonder De La Rue takes security seriously, gently asking you to hand over your wallet before you walk into the factory - checking your passport and inspecting your bags.

Demand for bank note currencies is growing all the time Colin Child, De La Rue

""Security is of paramount importance to the company, from how we treat visitors to how we make the notes,"" says chief operating officer Colin Child.

Visitors are normally customers or industry professionals, because very few people get to look round this factory.

The BBC team were the first people ever to broadcast from the site. And we aren't allowed to say where we were.

'We've invested very heavily'

But at a time when the need to export has become a pressing debate among politicians and economists, De La Rue offers an interesting example.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Steph McGovern reports from banknote maker De La Rue

While it does print banknotes for the Bank of England, almost all of its business is for export: other nations' currencies form the huge majority of its order book.

This morning, for instance, it is the Kuwaiti dinar that is keeping the staff busy.

As I talk to Mr Child, we stand next to a pile of maybe 2,500 large sheets of paper, each embossed with 45 perfect banknotes. This unassuming pile is worth about £2.5m ($4.2m).

""We've invested very heavily across our group over the past three years,"" he says.

""The level of sophistication in the notes is growing every year. All parts of the market are growing, all around the world.

""When debit and credit cards were introduced into the UK, they said we'd be finished. But here we are, still going stronger than ever.

""Demand for banknote currencies is growing all the time.""

But are we getting bored of notes? What about the growth of internet banking, contactless payments, PayPal and their ilk?

Well, if demand is waning, it's not showing. There is one statistic that tells the whole story: if you stacked the banknotes produced every week by De La Rue, they would reach the top of Everest, twice.

Yet as prolific as the company is at making notes, there will always be those who are just as determined to copy them.

The history of counterfeiting is as old as the history of money, and the battle becomes ever more sophisticated.

Image copyright De La Rue Image caption Despite other forms of payment, demand for traditional banknotes is high

'Covert measures'

The banknotes coming out of this factory have an array of security measures built into them, from the familiar array of watermarks and complicated etchings, through to see-through images and markings that only show up under ultraviolet light.

But then there is a third wave, known as ""covert measures"", that are often known only to a nation's central bank.

""The trick is to make a note that is sophisticated enough that it's almost impossible for someone else to copy one of them successfully, but where we can make millions of them with great precision,"" says the company's head of planning and logistics, Andrew Davidson.

""The battle against counterfeiters goes on constantly."" Behind him, the new notes are being scrutinised minutely to ensure each is perfect.

They are also, in many cases, rather lovely to look at.

British banknotes have always been solid and respectful, but the world is full of notes emblazoned with birds, animals, bright colours and rather daring designs.

Step forward Alan Newman, De La Rue's director of design and 10 times winner of the Banknote of the Year.

For the past three years, he has won the title for Kazakh notes, all of them colourful and clear.

My favourite is his award-winning Samoan 20-tala note, a cheerful yellow note with a waterfall on one side and a rather chubby bird, called a manumea, on the other.

He tells me: ""It can take anything from six months to two years to get a note into circulation.""

The industry is changing, of course.

Polymer banknotes are soon to be adopted by the Bank of England, as they have been by some other countries, although it's still not decided who will print them.

This sort of banknote, says Mr Child, is a ""small, but growing"" part of the industry. They are more durable but cost more to make.

The government's Help To Buy scheme, designed to boost the housing market, creates ""medium and long-term risks to the taxpayer"", MPs have warned.

The Public Accounts Committee said the portfolio of mortgage loans would create a ""heavy administrative burden"".

It also questioned whether it represented value for money for the taxpayer.

Housing minister Kris Hopkins rejected the report, arguing that the plan had supported the economy.

The Committee only looked at the first part of Help-to-Buy - the equity loan scheme.

It is aimed at people who can afford a mortgage but are struggling to get on the housing ladder because they are unable to raise a suitable deposit.

Under the scheme, the government offers buyers of a newly-built home a loan worth 20% of the purchase price, provided they have a deposit of 5% and the property costs less than £600,000.

The government loan is interest free for the first five years.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the committee, said that overseeing a portfolio of loans was new territory for the government and required ""careful management"".

'Wider benefits'

""There are also more immediate risks, particularly the fact that some buyers have accessed the scheme with deposits of less than 5%, which increases taxpayers' exposure to risk,"" she said.

She added that the government did not ""carry out any assessment of alternative, potentially more effective options before going ahead with the scheme - a violation of Treasury guidelines"".

Mr Hopkins accused her of grandstanding and political point-scoring.

""The Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme is building more homes and supporting the economy - in fact we estimate the wider economic benefits could be as much as £1.8bn,"" he said.

The report also said 13,000 home-buyers took advantage of the deal in the first nine months - mainly in northern England and the Midlands rather than the South East, where new home-building needs to be encouraged.

China has rejected a shipping alliance initiative aimed at saving the industry money, despite approval from the US and the EU.

The ""P3 Network"" was intended to operate in a similar way to code-sharing deals between airlines.

The idea was to allow the world's top three container-shipping operators by volume to cut costs by sharing ships and port facilities.

A successful alliance would have seen about 250 ships participating in P3.

The idea, announced last year, came from a proposed collaboration among three shipping groups: Maersk from Denmark, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) from Switzerland and CMA CGM from France.

The network was supposed to begin operating in the second quarter of this year, subject to approvals from various authorities including China, US and the EU.

The US Federal Maritime Commission approved the alliance in March, while EU competition authorities said earlier this month they would not raise any anti-trust issues in connection with the deal.

However, China's Ministry of Commerce has now rejected the tie-up.

Maersk said in a statement: ""The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) of the People's Republic of China announced that they have not approved the P3 Network. The MOFCOM's decision follows a review under China's merger control rules.""

Monopoly?

China's state-owned news agency Xinhua said the commerce ministry rejected the alliance ""due to monopoly concerns"".

According to various publications, the P3 Network would have positioned the three partners to control up to 40% of all cargo capacity along three trade routes: Asia to Europe, trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic.

Further economies of scale will still be achieved over a period of time Diego Aponte, Vice-president, MSC

The shippers had agreed to deploy about 250 ships between the three of them and share capacity of 2.6 million containers along the busiest sea routes.

Also in the statement, Maersk said: ""The lack of implementation of the P3 Network will have no material impact on the Maersk Group's expected result for 2014.""

But analysts are not convinced. Jacob Pedersen from Danish financial institution Sydbank said: ""This is very negative for Maersk. They won't achieve about $1bn in cost savings, equivalent to 5 to 6% of unit costs.""

For its part, MSC said it was ""disappointed"" with China's decision, and added it would work on other ways to save operating costs.

After China's ruling, MSC's vice-president, Diego Aponte, said: ""We could have achieved these efficiencies much faster through P3, but with our investment in more fuel-efficient vessels, further economies of scale will still be achieved over a period of time.""",China rejects shipping alliance,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75604000/jpg/_75604713_maerskcontainerdpa.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27898675

With inflation falling, wage increases still nugatory, and demand worse than expected in the UK's two biggest export markets - the eurozone and US - why oh why did the governor of the Bank of England signal last week that interest rates could start to rise this year?

Today's minutes of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meeting of 4 and 5 June shed a bit of light on this.

And the main argument appears to be this:

1) that the economy is gradually returning to normal;

2) so we should all prepare ourselves for a world in which the Bank's ""policy"" interest rate is no longer almost zero;

3) that it is probably better for the interest rate rises to be tiny, certainly no more than 1/4% and perhaps as little as 1/8%;

4) and that if rate rises are going to be so small, it is better to get on with them sooner rather than later, to evaluate what kind of drag they might impose on growth (since the impact is difficult to judge in advance).

So although the data released since 5 June - in particular, a fall disclosed yesterday in CPI inflation to 1.5%, well below the Bank's 2% target - would perhaps suggest the Governor jumped the gun last week with his alert that an interest rate rise may be just over the hill, the minutes suggest there is still a better than evens chance of a rate rise in the autumn.

Their tone implies that more important than the backward-looking picture of inflation to the Bank's rate decision is a sense of whether the momentum of growth is being sustained - and therefore, that slack in the economy would be used up faster than the Bank anticipates.

Or to put it another way, unless there is a clear sign of the current rapid recovery slowing down, the Bank will probably impose a pre-emptive small interest rate rise - because of concern that otherwise wage increases could accelerate in a way that would fuel wider inflation (and yes I know most of you will mutter, through gritted teeth, that there's no bloomin' sign of wodges of cash being chucked at you right now).

Here is another perspective on this: the Bank seems to have a marginally greater institutional fear of allowing inflation to take hold, rather than choking off recovery.

Which should not be a shock: it is, after all, a central bank.

Perhaps more surprising is the way that the members of the MPC seem to have sprinkled a bit of cold water on the governor's concerns that the greatest threat to sustainable growth in the UK is the incipient bubble in the housing market.

They flag up three successive months of falls in mortgage approvals, and note that mortgage applications and new buyer inquiries also appear to be weakening.

What they can't judge is whether this is a significant and lasting consequence of the new requirement on banks to be more prudent in their mortgage lending, imposed by the Mortgage Market Review, or a temporary hiatus caused by the introduction of that requirement.

They also posit that potential buyers are being sensible and are being put off by high house prices. Hmmm.

In other words, it is very uncertain whether the current excessive exuberance in house prices - and the danger that some banks are still lending too recklessly - will more or less naturally be replaced by calmer conditions, without evasive action by the Bank.

Which shows that next week's decision by the MPC's Bank of England sister - the Financial Policy Committee - on whether and how to take the heat of fast-rising house prices will not be an easy one.",Did Carney jump gun on interest rate rise?,http://www.bbc.com,"[Economics Editor, Robert Peston]",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75610000/jpg/_75610269_boe_pa.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27901347

The Bank of England has appointed one of China's ""big four"" banks as the Chinese currency clearing bank in London.

The China Construction Bank will be the London renminbi (RMB) clearing house.

The appointment is part of a plan to make London a hub for Chinese currency dealing.

Chancellor George Osborne said the bank would be ""hugely important in underpinning the future growth of London's RMB business"".

In March, the Bank of England signed a memorandum of understanding with the People's Bank of China setting out the deal.

The banks have said they want to encourage the cross-border use of renminbi, or yuan, to rebalance the global economy.

Mr Osborne said that ""the emergence of China's currency as one of the world's leading currencies will be the next huge change"" in the financial world.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The head of China's CCB Bank tells the BBC's Kamal Ahmed the deal is of ""critical importance""

In addition to the renminbi clearing agreement, Mr Osborne said that UK Export Finance, the UK's trade finance body, will start to give guarantees for transactions denominated in RMB.

Renminbi and the UK economy

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the clearing house deal was an ""important milestone"", because the Chinese bank would ""play a valuable role in facilitating greater use of the RMB for trade, investment and other economic activities in the UK"".

Standard Life chair Sir Gerry Grimstone said renminbi trading is the most important issue facing the City of London at the moment.

Mr Grimstone, who also chairs financial services trade body TheCityUK, helped broker the memorandum.

He said the deal could help to secure City jobs for decades.

""We're moving down a track very rapidly where London is going to become... the offshore centre for trading renminbi,"" he told the BBC.

Two-thirds of Chinese currency traded outside of China is already done in London, he added.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that trade deals worth more than £14bn had been signed during a state visit by Chinese premier, Li Keqiang.

Mr Li said the yuan clearing house deal ""will further consolidate and promote London's status as an international financial hub"" and help ""promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation"".

During Mr Li's visit, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) said that it had signed agreements with two of China's biggest banks to develop UK renminbi trading.

The LSE deal with the Bank of China will see the two firms design clearing and financing processes for financial products.

The deal with the Agricultural Bank of China is designed to help ease access to capital for Chinese companies.

Last year, China opened its markets to UK-based investors, letting London-based asset managers invest directly in Chinese stocks and shares in yuan.

A 200bn-yuan currency swap arrangement allows firms to settle trades directly in pounds and yuan rather than through US dollars.

In March, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, issued a 1bn-yuan bond in London, the first by an international financial institution.

Future deals?

Mr Osborne said that there were a number of ideas discussed with the Chinese delegation during Mr Li's visit, including how to make London an attractive place for Chinese businesses to set up international headquarters.

Direct stock market investment in RMB from Chinese individuals and institutions and was also discussed.

""I now want us to explore ways for Chinese individuals and institutions to invest RMB into London's global capital markets,"" he said.

The chancellor said he would also like to see the London Stock Exchange directly hooked up to stock exchanges in China.",Bank of England names London Chinese currency clearing hub,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/73817000/jpg/_73817011_160785715.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27901373

Housebuilder Berkeley Group has reported a 40% jump in annual profits following what it called a surge in economic confidence in the last year.

It said pre-tax profits for the year to 30 April were £380m, compared with £270.7m a year earlier.

The group completed 3,742 new homes in the year, 30% more than at the peak of the housing market in 2007.

It added there was capacity to increase house building with the continued support of the Help to Buy scheme.

The group also revealed it had invested £353m in nine new construction sites in the last year, which should see it build a further 2,500 new homes.

Berkeley Group chairman Tony Pidgley said he was confident the company had the right plan to deliver long-term sustainable success,

But he added the group remained ""alert to the inherently cyclical nature of the property market and the uncertainty surrounding future tax policy and political decision-making"".

""Monetary policy and the financial stability of banks, which is currently a concern of regulators, were both factors influencing the housing market in the long-term, Mr Pidgley added.

""Provided any future increases in interest rates or regulation of mortgages are matched with future wages growth as the economy expands, the prospects for the housing market remain positive.""

His comments come days after Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinted during his annual Mansion House speech that interest rates could rise earlier than expected.

Chancellor George Osborne also announced that the government would give the Bank new powers to restrict mortgage lending to prevent the property market overheating.

On Tuesday, official figures showed house prices rose 9.9% to £260,000 in the year to April, marking the biggest rise in property values in four years.

164,"Image copyright PA Image caption The members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to hold interest rates at 0.5%

Average wages may not rise until the jobless rate has fallen to 5%, a Bank of England policymaker has suggested.

Martin Weale said there may be more spare capacity in the economy than policymakers had previously estimated.

If so, it means employers have room to keep hiring for some time before they have to increase wages to attract scarce workers.

He said low wage growth could also keep interest rates at 0.5% for longer than currently expected.

But he added policymakers should start to raise interest rates before any sustained rise in real wages occurred.

In a speech to business leaders at a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference in Northern Ireland Dr Weale said for every one percentage point that unemployment was ""above its equilibrium,"" quarterly pay growth was likely to be 0.3% lower ""than it would otherwise be"".

He added: ""If I put all of the weakness in wages over the past year down to the unemployment gap being larger than we currently believe, this points to extra spare capacity of over half a per cent of GDP.

""This is consistent with a medium-term unemployment rate closer to 5% than our current range of 6% to 6.5% [the Bank's current consensus estimate of the point at which employers will have trouble recruiting suitable people].""

Spare capacity

In its February quarterly inflation report the Bank of England estimated there was between 1% and 1.5% of spare capacity in the UK economy, but Dr Weale's remarks suggest that could be as high as 2%.

Spare capacity most often stems from underinvestment by businesses. It is the Bank of England's way of gauging how far GDP is below its potential growth.

Although employment is at record levels, an increasing number of jobs are part time. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)show the number of people in part-time employment increased by 104,000 to 8.17 million.

And in April the ONS said nearly half of big companies in the UK use a total of 1.4 million zero-hours contracts, which do not guarantee minimum hours.

It has previously estimated that 583,000 people, around 2% of the UK workforce, were employed on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2013.

Dr Weale said it was difficult to determine the true state of employment in the UK making it equally possible that existing data could be overstating the amount of spare capacity in the labour market.

He said: ""One factor is that people who have been recently unemployed are less productive than average. If this is the case, then as the economy continues to grow, unemployment could fall more quickly than the MPC expects.""

The most recent official figures showed average wages grew by 0.7% in the three months to April.

Unemployment

Asked if Dr Weale believed the unemployment rate needed to fall to 5% before average wages would rise as they should, a Bank of England source said the policymaker was outlining ""one possibility"".

Dr Weale said falling unemployment and recovering productivity should result in wage growth picking up to around 4% a year.

However, he also warned that if there was less spare capacity than the Bank of England had estimated inflationary pressures developing in the labour market - wage rises - would mean interest rates would need to rise sooner rather than later.

Dr Weale's speech to the CBI comes on the same day that minutes from Bank of England's latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) showed its members were ""surprised"" to see markets did not expect an interest rate rise this year.

They voted unanimously to keep interest rates at 0.5%.

The minutes come a day after official figures showed inflation fell to 1.5% in the year to May.

Bank policymakers see economic growth slowing in the second half of the year.

But several economists have shifted their interest rate forecasts since the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, hinted during his annual Mansion House speech to business leaders that an interest rate rise ""could happen sooner than markets currently expect"".",No wage rises until jobless rate falls to 5% says MPC member,http://www.bbc.com,"[Business Reporter, Matthew West, Bbc News]",https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75607000/jpg/_75607456_75607455.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27901454

So, it is vital for business journalists to steer away from closed-economy thinking. Understanding and explaining the connections between consumers, producers, and policymakers in different countries is now essential to covering the beat.

So how has George Osborne pulled off the magical trick of maintaining spending on the police, imposing smaller than anticipated departmental spending cuts in general, and performing an expensive u-turn on tax-credit reductions, while remaining seemingly on course to turn this year's £74bn deficit into a £10bn surplus in 2020.

Well, it is because the government's forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has increased its prognosis of how much the Treasury will raise from existing taxes (not new ones) and reduced what it thinks the chancellor will shell out in interest on its massive debts.

In total the OBR thinks the national debt, the aggregate of the annual deficits, will be £23bn lower over the four years to 2020, and just because it is more optimistic about tax revenues and assorted costs.

Or to put it another way, George Osborne is today £23bn better off than he thought in July, and without doing anything at all.

Body marking has been used for centuries in parts of Africa to indicate a person's tribal heritage. It's becoming less common but some people still want to carry the marks of their ancestors. This article contains images which some might find disturbing.

In the town of Ouidah in southern Benin, a voodoo ritual is about to take place following two days of celebration.

The Houeda ethnic group is one of a number in Benin which believes that scarring children - usually on their face - will connect them with their ancestors.

The children are given new names, their hair is shaved and they are taken to a convent where an oracle helps them to communicate with previous generations.

""This is part of our tradition and it is very important to me,"" says Genevieve Boko whose six-month-old daughter Marina and nephews Luc and Hospice, aged 10 and 12, are all about to undergo scarification.

Ash is used to mark the place where the incisions are to be made and then it takes a few seconds to make the cuts.

Image copyright Laeila Adjovi

""My friends asked me if it hurt and if I cried and I said 'No',"" says Luc afterwards. ""Before, when I walked in the street with my big brother who has the scars, people would not believe he is my brother. Now I am happy because we look the same.""

Since her husband died, Gamba Dahoui has carried out all the local scarifications - she cleans the incisions with medicinal plants and gin. Charcoal is also put on the wounds to help them heal.

Image copyright Laeila Adjovi

Dahoui always uses the same knife, ignoring official advice to use new sterile blades for each person, to avoid the risk of transmitting blood-borne infections such as tetanus and HIV.

But scarring is becoming less popular. An increasing number of families take part in just the first stage of the ceremony, stopping before the incisions are made.

It's the same in other parts of the country where each ethnic group has its own distinct scarring patterns.

""With my scars, I am identified everywhere I go,"" says Fleury Yoro, who comes from Atacora in the north of the country. ""If I had the choice I would not have wanted to be scarred like this.""

When he studied in Benin's largest city, Cotonou, he says he was often mocked because of his scars. Some people ""did not want anyone to think they could be friends with such a savage,"" he says.

Others have different reasons for deciding not to pass the scars on to younger generations. Sinkeni Ntcha stopped after his first three children ""because of Aids,"" he says. ""Blades have to be changed each time but the chiefs refused.""

For him, a member of the Otomari people, the marks are ""useless"". Traditional culture can be expressed in other ways, he says, through language, dances, initiation ceremonies and architecture.

Many Otomari people still opt for scarring, including some young women who may have cuts on their backs and stomachs when they reach puberty to ""show your courage,"" says Edith (pictured above). The patterns are often similar to the designs on the walls of local buildings.

While Genevieve Boko's daughter Marina (below) was six months old when she received the marks - babies in some areas of Benin undergo the process a week after they are born.

In neighbouring Nigeria, concerns about the rights of young people have led to some states passing a law that bans the practise on all children.

But this is not a move that would be welcomed by everyone in Benin. ""We are not violating children's rights, we are just showing the children where they are from and what they will go through in life,"" says Telesphore Sekou Nassikou, chief editor at a radio station in Natitingou in the north-west of the country.

For him, the scars convey a message: ""Beware, there is pain in this world, and you will feel pain in your life. But the pain will stop, if you can endure.""

Silicon Valley in California is still the world's centre of technological innovation, with a culture of risk-taking billionaires betting on the next big thing.

The Middle East and North Africa is not a region known for its high-tech entrepreneurs, but one spin-off from the Arab Spring is an explosion of online social networking and use of smartphones.

Alastair Leithead joined a group of the Middle East's brightest young entrepreneurs on a tour of Silicon Valley - to announce their arrival in the market, search for investors and work on the perfect business pitch.

Football fans have come from all over the world to watch the World Cup matches, but not many can say they travelled across South America on foot.

Four England fans walked for 100 days from Argentina to Brazil to raise money to build a water well in the host country, which has been suffering from drought.

Adam Burns says they walked a total of 1,966km (1,121 miles) , a reference to the year the last time England won the World Cup.

For the BBC's Real Fans series he told Franz Strasser that along the way they faced extreme heat, were charged at by bulls, and picked up what they thought was a stray dog.

British supermarkets are suddenly full of a plethora of Brazilian-themed produce. But how Brazilian are they, asks Clare Spencer.

Think of Brazilian food and you may think of the barbecue dish churrasco. You may be less likely to think of Pot Noodle, even if it is Brazilian steak-flavoured. But that's one of many items popping up on British shelves this summer because of the World Cup.

If you want a sweet Brazilian snack, you could try the rich chocolate brigadeiros. But what about the M&Ms Brazil version? They are made with peanuts, not Brazil nuts. But they are in a yellow and green packet.

For a Brazilian main meal, you could try feijoada - a bean and meat stew. For the British consumer, Pieminister have put that in a pie. If you don't fancy pie, KFC have a carnival box - essentially the same as a normal box meal with extra chilli mayonnaise and barbecue dip. Dominos also have two carnival pizzas - the Fiesta and the Rio, only they spell it Carnivale. Never mind that the carnival ended in March.

You might want to wash it all down with a Brazilian soft drink. If so, you might try Guarana Antarctica, which is also an official sponsor of the Brazilian national football team. Lucozade have other ideas - their limited edition drinks include ""The Brazilian"" which is mango and mandarin.

If you want something a little stronger, there are plenty of Brazilian drinks. Perhaps the most famous is the cachaca-based cocktail caipirinha. Or you could have WKD's ""Brazilian alcoholic mix"". The bottle describes the contents as ""sparkling fortified alcoholic premix blending mixed fruit flavours. Contains caffeine.""

There's more, much more. Branston have a ""sweet and spicy"" Brazilian pickle, Tilda have ""samba"" rice. There's even a Brazilian water. Volvic coconut and pineapple flavoured water is labelled as ""inspired"" by Brazil. Pringles have a ""Brazilian zesty chilli style"" which, according to one reviewer, has a distinctly lime flavour, but you'll only find it in Asda. And then there's Mattessons ""Brazilian chargrilled chicken"" Fridge Raiders.

Tessa McFadzean, senior brand manager for Mattessons, said of the product: ""Brazilian Chargrilled flavour Fridge Raiders will appeal to the three out of four shoppers who say they want to see more world cuisines in store."" The advert for the Pot Noodles, on the other hand, appears to imply that their product is Brazilian because it is for people who don't make too much effort. ""I wanted things easy, like those Brazilians,"" it says. ""Turns out all I needed for the easy life was one of these new Brazilian barbecues - you just add water.""

Bar Magazine reported that WKD provided kits for venues to conjure up Brazilian spirit, with straplines such as: ""It's like a taste of Rio. Even if you're in Rochdale"".

A World Cup is of course a massive marketing opportunity. Many brands can't afford to be official sponsors so Brazil themes are the next best thing, says Robert Opie at the Museum of Brands and Packaging. The same impulse saw much use of the Union Jack during the London 2012 Olympics. Firms would have been heavily penalised for using any Olympic branding, such as the rings. Instead brands like Ryvita used the flag so as ""not to miss out on the emotion of the moment"".

But the perception of World Cups being a bonanza for supermarkets may be wrong. The World Cup probably doesn't lead to more sales, argues Planet Retail analyst Stephen Springham. He analysed Office for National Statistics UK sales figures for the last 12 major football tournaments. He found retail sales actually dipped in more tournaments than they grew.

If consumers are buying World Cup-related products, they are buying them instead of something else, he believes. But Planet Retail's David Grey suggests supermarkets have stocked up on Brazilian-themed food because they fear if they don't, customers will go elsewhere.

It's not easy capturing the essence of real Brazilian food. Brazilian-born Michelin star chef Marcello Tully has incorporated some dishes at his restaurant on the Isle of Skye. He says that although they seem like basic dishes, they can be technically difficult to make. For acaraje - deep fried bean paste and shrimp - he painstakingly peeled every bean.

He spent the majority of his career in food development for manufacturers and knows how hard it would have been to make genuinely Brazilian products.

But Tully has noticed the change in the availability of Brazilian products in the UK. He says that even two years ago it was difficult get hold of the Brazilian spirit cachaca in the UK. Now, it's much easier.

Perhaps this summer will be a significant moment for Brazilian food too.

The orbiting Gaia telescope will lose some performance because stray light is getting inside the observatory, the European Space Agency (Esa) says.

But the impacts are likely to be very small, scientists believe, and the expectation is that all the mission's chief objectives will still be met.

Most of the unwanted light appears to be creeping around the giant shield Gaia uses to shade itself from the Sun.

The ""pollution"" makes it harder for the observatory to see the faintest stars.

""I must say this is not a major problem,"" said Esa's Gaia project manager, Giuseppe Sarri.

""The point is the spacecraft is doing very well in terms of everything is working, and now we're focussing on the things we want to improve.

""We were expecting to get some stray light but the fact is, it is larger than we predicted,"" he told BBC News.

Gaia was sent into orbit in December to do astrometry on a billion stars - to map their precise positions, distances and motions.

Telescope tent

This huge sample should provide the first true picture of our Milky Way Galaxy's structure.

As is normal after launch, the observatory was immediately put through a period of complex systems check-out and instrument calibration.

Engineers noticed early on that unexpected light was getting inside the big tent covering the satellite's dual telescope mechanism.

Modelling indicates most of it is sunlight being diffracted around the observatory's 10.5m-wide sunshield.

But further analysis suggests there is likely also some additional component - probably the general diffuse light on the sky itself.

Gaia - The discovery machine

Gaia will make a very precise 3D map of our Milky Way Galaxy

It is the successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped some 100,000 stars

The one billion to be catalogued by Gaia is still only 1% of the Milky Way's total

But the survey's quality promises a raft of discoveries beyond just the star map

It will find new asteroids and planets; It will test physical constants and theories

Gaia's sky map will be the reference to guide future telescopes' observations

The effect is certainly a nuisance because it makes it more difficult for Gaia to discern the least bright objects.

It was the mission's aim to measure the positions of all stars down to magnitude 20 (about 400,000 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye).

The stray light means about 40% of the accuracy of those measurements at this lowest magnitude will be lost.

Backwards and forwards

On the upside, it should be possible to get some of the performance back if Esa agrees to extend the mission and additional data can be taken.

And it is true to say that most of Gaia's science will be done at magnitude 15 (4,000 times fainter than the naked eye limit) and brighter, which is unaffected.

Where the pollution issue may be felt more keenly is in determining the motions of stars towards or away (radial velocity) from the satellite.

This information will have a number of applications but will be used to help make a 3D movie of the galaxy - to run forwards to see what happens millions of years into the future, and backwards to reveal how the galaxy was assembled in the deep past.

Gaia was hoping to get radial velocity data for about 150 million of the brightest stars.

It involves taking the light from a star and spreading it out into its component colours for analysis. For the faintest objects in the targeted sub-set of stars, this process again becomes much harder with stray light.

There's no reason to believe Gaia won't be a triumph Prof Gerry Gilmore, Cambridge University

The Gaia team thinks with some smart techniques it can recover some of the performance loss, but as it stands the mission may get radial velocity measurements now on only about 100 million stars.

""We say only about 100 million stars - that's still pretty spectacular,"" said Prof Gerry Gilmore, a Gaia scientist from the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University, UK.

""We don't actually know how many stars there are in the sky at the magnitudes needed to do the radial velocity measurements,"" he added.

""We had a guess that it was 150 million but that could be wrong by a factor of two; so it's quite possible there are a lot more stars out there [we can still measure].

""Gaia is the first ever high spatial resolution survey and so until Gaia has scanned the sky we won't know what's on the sky.""

Image copyright ASTRIUM Image caption Large sections of Gaia's telescope mechanism were constructed out of silicon carbide

Engineers are also tracking an issue with what they call the ""basic angle"".

Part of Gaia's measurement strategy requires it to look at two parts of the sky at the same time to lock a frame of reference.

This is why it carries two telescopes held rigidly at an offset angle of 106.5 degrees. Great effort was put into making sure this basic angle was absolutely stable, with many components being constructed out of stiff silicon carbide as a consequence.

Exploring our galaxy Image copyright Getty Images How do telescopes let us see so far into space?

But a vanishingly small flexure is being detected - fractionally beyond what had been anticipated.

The team believes, though, it can nullify any impacts if the behaviour can be properly characterised.

""It's all nuisance stuff. Depending how you count it, there are about 500 critical components on Gaia and they're all working fine,"" said Prof Gilmore.

""Yes, it's complicated; yes, there are things we don't fully understand yet; but there's no reason to believe Gaia won't be a triumph.""

Mr Sarri added that after the long commissioning process, the telescope was now ready to gather data continuously.

""In the last week, we had an informal handover and it's been working already in science mode on occasions. But now we will move into a period of 28 days of uninterrupted operation,"" he told BBC News.

Privacy campaigners are seeking to stop GCHQ using ""unlawful hacking"" to help its surveillance efforts.

Privacy International said the UK intelligence service has infected millions of devices to spy on citizens and scoop up personal data.

A 30-page legal complaint has been filed with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal which monitors whether the UK's spying laws are being observed.

GCHQ said it had no comment to make on the legal complaint.

In a statement, the Privacy International pressure group said the documents released by Edward Snowden had detailed the many ways that GCHQ was spying on people, many of which violated the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees a right to privacy and to freedom of expression.

GCHQ and NSA programmes uncovered by Mr Snowden let the agencies listen via microphones, watch through webcams and scoop up detailed web browsing histories, said Privacy International.

Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said the surveillance was the modern equivalent of the government entering someone's house and reading their diary, correspondence and journals.

The freedom GCHQ and the NSA had to carry out surveillance was equivalent to ""covert, complete, real-time physical and electronic surveillance"", he said.

""Arbitrary powers such as these are the purview of dictatorships not democracies,"" he said. ""Unrestrained, unregulated government spying of this kind is the antithesis of the rule of law and government must be held accountable for their actions.""

The IPT has yet to respond to the filing of the complaint.

Prof Richard Aldrich, a lecturer at the University of Warwick who has written a history of GCHQ, said the agency was much more worried about such legal challenges than ever before as judges had become ""much more unpredictable in this area"" than they were a decade ago.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales described it as ""astonishing"" and a form of ""wide-sweeping censorship"".

However, the EU has defended the move, saying that in cases where the public interest case is more pressing than the individual's privacy rights, links should not be taken down.

'Slow and cumbersome'

Getting that balance right is a delicate issue, said Michael Sandys from Liverpool-based Jackson & Canter Solicitors.

""Lawmakers will need to ensure they find a way to allow some information to be removed in a timely fashion while at the same time not allowing history to be rewritten,"" he said.

""If an individual goes to court about an article or piece of data which is found to be defamatory or inaccurate then there are levers in place for Google to quickly remove it from the search results.""

But he argued that Google could do more to deal with genuine cases of incorrect information.

""I have made requests on behalf of clients a number of times for the removal of content which defames them. Sometimes it is dealt with well but other times the process can be slow and cumbersome.""

Facebook is introducing automatically playing video adverts to the UK.

The social network initially trialled the features in the US and the first ads are expected to play in Britain within weeks.

They will run without sound unless clicked on and, on mobile devices, will load only over wi-fi.

Facebook will hope to continue its recent success in increasing ad revenues, having seen a significant rise in the past 12 months.

The company said on Wednesday that it would be introducing the ads with a ""limited group of advertisers"" in the selected countries, including the UK, Australia and France.

It is also unveiling the feature, called Premium Video Ads, in Brazil, Canada, Germany and Japan. But Facebook did not reveal the companies that would be advertising.

Tentative

Facebook said the introduction would be tentative and, while the first ad could appear in June, most would not run until later as it attempted to control quality.

""We'll roll out Premium Video Ads slowly and monitor how people interact with them,"" said Facebook in a statement.

""This limited introduction allows us to concentrate our efforts on a smaller number of advertisers with high-quality campaigns.""

Each video advert will be 15 seconds long and will start playing without sound as it appears on the screen.

The ads will stop playing if users scroll past them. But, if people tap or click on the video, it will expand into a full-screen view and sound will start, Facebook said.

Facebook's figures for the first quarter of 2014 showed it made $2.27bn (£1.34bn) from advertising, an 82% increase on the same quarter last year.

And it said that mobile ads, which have generated very little return until recently, represented about 59% of the company's total advertising revenue for the quarter.

That was up from about 30% of advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2013.

Jeremy Arditi, UK managing director of online video ad tech company Ebuzzing, said it was a good move for Facebook.

But he said: ""Most online video ads annoy people and interrupt their browsing experience,"" adding that industry estimates indicated that ""around 60% of online video ads don't get seen"".

Facebook is to release a new feature on its mobile app that ""listens"" to your music and TV shows.

If the song or show is recognised by the app, users can publish the information on their profile or to selected friends.

The service hopes to take advantage of the ""second screen"" trend, which sees fans of TV shows in particular sharing their experiences on social networks.

However, some users have privacy concerns.

The feature, which will be available in a few weeks' time, uses the microphones inside users' smartphones to detect nearby music or TV shows.

As the user begins writing a status update, a small animated icon will appear at the top of the app.

If the app detects the appropriate audio signals and finds a match from its database, the user can then share what he or she is watching or listening to.

Facebook says the feature can be turned off at any time, the audio recording is not stored anywhere and the device cannot identify background noise or conversations.

""If you share music, your friends can see a 30-second preview of the song. For TV shows, the story in News Feed will highlight the specific season and episode you're watching,"" Facebook said in a statement.

The company hopes this new method of sharing user listening and watching habits will take advantage of the five billion status updates related to TV and music experiences that the social networking giant sees on a yearly basis.

However, automating part of the sharing process has left some users suspicious, with Nicole Simon commenting on TechCrunch that: ""While the idea is nice and technology really interesting, I have no interest in Facebook 'observing' my audio and surrounding. Yes, it starts currently as opt-in, and only on occasion, but there is no trust from my side for even that.""

Advertising and Shazam

The BBC understands that this new feature was not specifically designed to enhance Facebook's advertising. However, the company could push an advert to a user's phone based on their tracked listening habits.

This is in keeping with Facebook's current approach to advertising, which uses publicly provided information on users' profiles to push advertisements that are more relevant to each individual user.

The basic idea behind Facebook's feature is not a new one - since 2002 Shazam, which has recently seen a $3m investment from Sony Music Entertainment, has been providing a similar audio recognition service, with its website describing itself as ""a mobile app that recognises music and TV around you"".

Users of Shazam - all 450 million of them - can not only share their listening habits with other users of the app, but they can also push their updates to Facebook and Twitter.

The app also provides artist biographies, lyrics, videos, recommended tracks and concert tickets.

After defeat to Italy, the stakes are high as England prepare to take on Uruguay in the World Cup. With desperate fans clinging to any sign of hope, could it be that Dutch carpet-manufacturing technology comes to England's rescue?

When England's players walk out on to the Arena de Sao Paulo pitch on Thursday for their qualifier against Uruguay, their studs will be sinking into familiar terrain.

It is that distinctive feel of the hybrid pitch - part polyethylene, part normal grass, blades that are 4% plastic and 96% as-nature-intended.

It was trail-blazed by Huddersfield Town in the mid-1990s, because they needed a pitch tough enough for both football and rugby. And the method has become turf's ""third way"" in the Premier League, a thoroughly English compromise.

It remains a relatively recent technology for the World Cup. Two stadiums tried hybrid pitches in South Africa in 2010, for the first time in the competition's history.

On Thursday England will be playing on Brazil's only hybrid pitch.

""This might offer that 0.001% of a difference,"" says David Saltman, of Pitchcare, who has been a groundsman for 25 years. ""But that's what managers care about, because that can win them games.""

Turf tech

Computer-guided injection machines worked their way methodically around the Arena de Sao Paulo last November - though from a distance they simply looked like two juddering mobile tents.

The machines were busy injecting more than 20 million plastic fibres into the soil.

In a painstaking process, polyethylene fibres - fake grass - were planted in a grid system, which broke the pitch down into 2cm (0.8in) by 2cm units.

The devices are like huge sewing machines, drawing on the same kind of technology used in the carpet-making industry.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Nicholls of Dutch firm Desso explains how hybrid pitches are made

This is no coincidence, because the Dutch firm that specialises in this technique, Desso, is a carpet manufacturer.

Each machine cuts the plastic yarn into 40cm strips, which are ""bobbed"" in front of a needle. The needle catches the plastic at mid-point to create a loop, which is then plunged into the ground.

Once the plastic fibres are laid in this way, special sports grass seed is grown and established, so the two intertwine at root level. This is what is called a hybrid pitch.

It is a method born of frustration with other turf techniques.

Pitch perfect

English clubs had a brief flirtation with fully synthetic plastic pitches in the 1980s - but these were seen as too bouncy, prone to cause injuries, and offering an unfair advantage to the team that trained on them.

While many footballers favoured the feel of natural turf - which after all had sufficed for the game since its infancy - it was inconsistent, notoriously difficult to maintain and periodically led to ""quagmire"" pitches - the bete noire of managers on the losing side of an encounter.

The rebuilt Wembley stadium had perennial problems maintaining its natural turf, until it switched to a hybrid system in 2010. It is meant to offer the best of both worlds - a tough, durable pitch, and the feel and ""play"" of natural grass.

Image copyright Michael Schilder Image caption Desso has laid hybrid pitches for Manchester Untied (pictured), Arsenal, Manchester City and is currently working on Chelsea's

About two-thirds of Premier League pitches are now hybrid, fitted by Desso.

The main rival to this kind of turf technology is known as the ""reinforced"" pitch, developed by English firm Mansfield Sand.

This method involves adding polypropylene fibres. But the process takes place beneath the surface in what is known as the ""rootzone"", so no artificial blades are actually visible.

Newcastle United and Fulham both used this technology for their pitches.

""Most players would says hybrid pitches are a little bit harder,"" says turf veteran David Saltman - an assessment that Desso shares.

Before away games, managers will try and train on similar pitches to their opponents, Mr Saltman explains.

""For your Wengers or Fergies, top-end managers, the quality of the pitch will add an extra dimension to how they play.""

Game on

In the run-up to the World Cup, Brazilian contractors worked intensely to make sure its pitches met strict Fifa regulations.

This work was hampered by public outcries over escalating costs, as well as the range of Brazil's climate.

Image copyright other Image caption Rigid polypropylene fibres and flexible elastane fibres (red) in Mansfield Sand's latest kind of reinforced pitch, known as Fibrelastic

In fact half of the 12 pitches prepared for Brazil's World Cup are of the old-fashioned natural turf variety.

The final itself on July 13 at Estadio do Maracana, Rio de Janeiro, will be held on natural grass.

All of the other pitches, except Sao Paulo, opted for the ""reinforced"" pitch technique.

So, will English players who are used to Premier League pitches have a slight advantage when they play against Uruguay on Sao Paulo's hybrid pitch?

""Look, when I was groundsman before a cup final,"" says Mr Saltman, who looked after Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, ""every manager was intrigued by the pitch.""

""They would come up to me and ask, 'How is the pitch going to perform?'. And they would often then incorporate this into their team talks, 'It's a greasy pitch today, try swinging some crosses in,' that sort of thing.

""We groundsmen used to be viewed as cloth cap-wearing blokes sitting in a tin can shed,"" Mr Saltman adds wryly. ""Now people are starting to realise how much science is involved.""

Facebook has revealed a new photo-messaging app after accidentally releasing it on Apple's app store.

Known as Slingshot, the app's features include sharing photos and videos with friends and sending ""reaction shots"".

Like Snapchat, all images are deleted once sent and users can scribble or type over their photos.

Facebook has confirmed Slingshot's existence, but it is not known when the app will be officially released.

Reporters from The Verge and TechCrunch took screengrabs of the app's promotional material before it was removed by Facebook.

The images appear to reveal many of Slingshot's features, the more unusual of which include an unlocking mechanism, whereby photos received from friends must be unlocked by sending a photo back to the original sender.

It is thought that the back and forth ""slinging"" of images is why the app is called Slingshot.

""Earlier today, we accidentally released a version of Slingshot, a new app we're working on,"" confirmed Facebook in a statement.

The company did not reveal when the app would be made available, stating: ""It'll be ready soon and we're excited for you to try it out.""

Snapchat competitor?

In 2012 Facebook bought photo-sharing network Instagram for $1bn.

A year later, it was reported that Snapchat rejected a $3bn bid from Facebook, revealing the social media giant's apparent continued and serious interest in photo-messaging services.

Previously Facebook attempted and failed to create a successful image-messaging app called Poke, which was recently abandoned and had been described by some as a ""blatant copycat app.""

However, unlike Poke, Slingshot has a number of unique features not found in rivals such as Snapchat, which could make it a strong competitor.

Another similar app and potential rival is Taptalk, which is reportedly admired among some Facebook engineers.

Taptalk provides a comparatively minimalist and simplified approach to image messaging, allowing users to send personal pictures or videos by tapping or holding their friend's profile picture.

It has also been noted that Slingshot's icon is strikingly similar to Taptalk's.",Facebook accidentally reveals new image messaging app,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75418000/jpg/_75418662_facebook.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27781188

The Hello Games team doesn't have a stand at E3.

No flashing lights, no pounding music, no booth babes.

But boy, has it stolen the show.

Its game, No Man's Sky - an ""open world"" science -fiction game title - has arguably generated more buzz than any other title on show here in Los Angeles.

Shown on-screen as part of Sony's PlayStation press conference earlier this week, it had the audience cheering - and other developers looking on with envy.

Because unlike the other titles lavished with that kind of attention, this isn't a game created by hundreds of people for millions of dollars.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption The creator of Watch Dogs, Amazon's games unit, the editor-in-chief of games news site Kotaku and the founder of The Verge have all raved about No Man's Sky

Rather, No Man's Sky began its life in a makeshift office above a tile shop in Guildford, a town just outside London.

""It's absolutely insane,"" laughs Sean Murray, Hello Games' co-founder, in an interview with the BBC.

""We were on stage for about five or six minutes. Pretty much the only other people who got that were teams of hundreds. Hello Games in total is 10 people, with just a handful working on No Man's Sky.""

'Fun' flood

Back in December, with the team now working out of a glorified shed, the glitz of E3 felt a long way away for Hello Games.

""Guildford and a lot of the UK was super-badly flooded. We lost all of our equipment, it pretty much wiped out the office. It was Christmas Eve.

""Christmas day we were there just chucking everything out and starting again. We'd lost so much.""

""But this team, we love crisis and problems. We all banded together. I shouldn't say this, but in a weird way it's sort of fun - or at least it's part of the journey, part of the adventure.""

Competitive creators

The level of competitiveness in trying to secure exclusive titles from independent developers is heating up, as Sony and Microsoft are both desperate to be seen as the place to be for indies.

Shelf Life

Microsoft and Sony both like to paint their eagerness to empower indie developers as an almost charitable effort.

But in truth, says Ovum analyst Paul Jackson, it's very serious business.

""Indie games are quick to develop,"" he says. ""And Microsoft and Sony need next-gen titles.""

Many of the biggest games coming up on the consoles won't be on the shelves until 2015 - something of an issue in the run up to Christmas.

Indies provide a trendy way to plug the gap.

Image copyright Sony Image caption Many of the games in the new consoles' online stores were released by the indies

""They need to add to the number of games that are available, and make a healthy release pipeline for this year"" Mr Jackson says.

Microsoft's Mr Charla acknowledges that indies do help make online store shelves stay fresh.

""To us it's really important that when someone turns on their Xbox One, they see new content, they see a broad array of content, and they see a really diverse array of content.""

Whatever the motives, Mr Jackson argues that gamers are the eventual winners - as indie developers dare to break ground the more risk-averse publishers would never dream of getting near.

Sensible soccer

Perhaps the embodiment of that attitude is Frank Cifaldi from indie outfit Other Ocean.

The game can be played by eight people at once, around one screen, and the aim is to simply fire a ball into an opponent's net, like football.

The game has echoes of the epically playable Sensible Soccer series, a world away from the painstaking simulation of the Fifa series.

The hashtag in #IDARB isn't a corny marketing ploy - the game has a terrifically unique social media tie-in.

""It's not like no-one wanted this stuff, it was just that your only option for selling a game was in a box.

""We're free to do this now.""

Enormous

It's easy to group indie games as being titles that are small, quirky, fun - or even just nostalgic.

In that regard, No Man's Sky is a game changer.

Image copyright Hello Games Image caption As this concept arts shows, the intention is that the final game will allow players to chase each other through canyons

Alongside the multi-million dollar budgets of the biggest titles like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed, No Man's Sky does not look like an indie game.

Rather than hire huge teams to painstakingly create levels, and worlds, that take months and years to build, the Hello Games team has instead put its efforts into creating a system that is essentially able to generate highly complex worlds itself.

""We're trying to do it procedurally,"" explains Mr Murray, ""using next-gen consoles and PCs to make that content for us, and make that process easier. Once that constraint is removed we're a lot freer.""

The game is about exploration, and the procedural world-building technology means that when you fly out into the distance, you're covering ground never before seen by anyone else playing the game.

In Sony's media suite at E3, the BBC finds Shahid Ahmad. As Sony's lead for independent games in Europe, he looks like a man who has just discovered buried treasure.

""Infinite, you could say. It's one of the most inspirational titles that we've seen.

""For me No Man's Sky evokes the hope of sci-fi, and the pioneering spirit. It's a great story. We're absolutely delighted.""

Amazon has launched its own music-streaming service in the US, taking on rivals such as Spotify and Google.

The feature is limited to subscribers of Amazon Prime, the company's premium membership programme.

Customers pay $99 (£59) a year for free shipping, e-books, and access to an online library of films and TV shows.

But Amazon's music collection offers just over a million songs, far fewer than Spotify or Beats Music, which both boast 20 million tracks.

Beats Music was recently acquired by Apple in a deal worth $3bn.

Amazon says the music library will be available to Prime subscribers without ads or playback restrictions.

Users will also be able to download tracks to their mobile devices, to listen to them without an internet connection.

Is creating female video game characters too much work?

That might sound like a rhetorical question, but it was actually one of the main topics of discussion at this year's E3 conference - the video game industry's biggest event, which ended on Thursday.

The issue arose after James Therien, technical director at European gamemaker Ubisoft, told trade publication VideoGamer that the latest instalment of Ubisoft hit Assassin's Creed would not feature any playable female characters because it would have ""doubled the work"".

The reaction was swift - and negative - especially when a former Ubisoft developer questioned how much work would be involved.

""The message from the industry is that men come first,"" says Jayd Ait-Kaci, a gamer from Canada who started the hashtag #womenaretoohardtoanimate, which was picked up widely.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Reaction to Ubisoft's decision on social media was primarily negative

""#womenaretoohardtoanimate when you throw all your efforts into putting them in situations where their clothes are strategically ripped off"" wrote @emilyrwanner.

But what left many scratching their heads was that Ubisoft had already included female assassins in earlier instalments, and that the firm has emphasised diversity, tapping actress and gamer Aisha Tyler as its host at E3.

Image copyright Square Enix Image caption Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider games is one of the most high-profile female video game characters

So what's going on: is the video game industry progressing - or regressing - when it comes to female representation?

Damsels in distress

Of course, the issue of gender ratios in video games is not a new one - but it did seem to be on more observers' minds at E3 this year, with observers tweeting about a lack of female characters in Sony's presentation and videogame site Polygon publishing an article titled ""There were more severed heads than women presenters at E3 2014"".

Studies have consistently shown that at least since the 1990s, the percentage of female characters in video games has remained steady at around 15%.

""It's amazing how little has changed,"" says University of Pennsylvania professor, Yasmin Kafai, the co-editor of one of the seminal books on gender in videogames, Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat, published in 2008.

Who plays video games in the US?

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Most gamers in the US have been playing for an average of 14 years

Source: Entertainment Software Association

While there have been exceptions - Lara Croft, in Tomb Raider, or 14-year-old Ellie in The Last of Us - the most recent data found that only 4% of the main characters in the top 25 selling videogames of 2013 were female.

And even when female characters do exist, their representation is generally skewed.

""The research is pretty consistent that there are two types of female characters: the 'damsel in distress' or the 'ultimate warrior',"" says Edward Downs, a professor of communications at the University of Minnesota, who notes that most ""ultimate warrior"" characters are depicted as hyper-sexualised.

Money on the table

The thought for a long time had been that since men were the primary consumers of video games, the gender balance was lamentable but not surprising if firms were simply designing games with their target audience in mind.

But the dynamics of who is gaming has steadily changed in the last five years, as women increasingly flock to video games, with the latest industry figures in the US showing that 48% of gamers are female.

Efforts by pioneers such as Anita Sarkeesian, who runs the website Feminist Frequency, which details sexual dynamics in games, have also brought increasing attention to sexism in games and the industry.

Image copyright Feminist Frequency Image caption Anita Sarkeesian's efforts at Feminist Frequency to bring attention to sexism in the industry are widely cited

That has put pressure on video game firms like Ubisoft, Sony and Nintendo, among others, to fix the ratio in their games and to change the culture surrounding events like E3, once populated by ""booth babes"".

Although Ms Sarkeesian was subject to rape and death threats for her efforts, it does feel like ""the industry as a culture feels less sexist than it used to,"" says University of Southern California professor Dmitri Williams.

That is partially because the video game industry realised they were ""leaving a lot of money on the table by alienating women,"" he says.

That has led to some inroads: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Civilization: Beyond Earth, Evolve, and Dead Island 2 were all new releases at E3 that either allowed one to play as a woman or had female protagonists.

Image copyright Telltale Games Image caption The latest instalment of the Borderlands franchise features a female protagonist, Fiona

Image copyright Mass Effect Image caption BioWare's third-person shooter game Mass Effect has been singled out for praise for its female characters

Developer crunch

Of course, there are caveats.

While the percentage of female gamers has increased, that has been primarily due to the rise of mobile games, which often do not have characters. For instance, 60% of popular smartphone game Temple Run's players are female (although that game does allow one to play as a female character).

Is indie the answer? Image copyright Deirdra Kai Deirdra Kiai is a game-designer who also identifies as genderqueer. Kiai first worked for big firms as a developer. ""When I first entered I felt kind of positive - I'm surrounded by all these white guys, maybe I can make a difference by representing a different demographic,"" says Kiai. But Kiai says the industry pushed them out after it became clear it was a ""very sexist and racist homophobic place targeting the lowest common denominator"". Now, Kiai focuses on the independent games scene and hopes it will help be an agent for change. ""Game development tools are becoming easier to use and cheaper, so we're getting a lot more people making games from a lot of different interesting perspectives,"" Kiai says.

The gender ratio of players of so-called hardcore games, like first-person shooter games such as Halo, is generally disproportionately men, says Prof Williams, who also runs a game analytics firm, NinjaMetrics

It is those games - FPSs, in industry speak - that many observers see the industry regressing, not progressing.

""I think we're starting to see in some cases at least in some genres an even larger gap in the types of players,"" says Prof Downs.

The need to constantly refresh successful franchises to boost console sales has also put pressure on developers to churn out games at ever faster speeds.

That time crunch is a problem, says New York University professor and game designer Katherine Isbister, because most developers are men.

Developers ""tend to create things that are similar to things they're seeing and playing so there's a feedback loop,"" she says.

Two steps forward

This brings the industry to a bit of a chicken or egg problem, at least when it comes to the hardcore games on consoles.

""Are women not playing hardcore games because they don't like them? Or because they feel alienated?"" summarises Prof Williams.

Ubisoft says it is committed to diversity, and in a statement to the BBC did not comment on whether or not the decision to exclude female assassins was an economic choice or one based on user statistics.

Image copyright Jenny Haniver Image caption Jenny Haniver posts audio recordings and screenshots of the abuse she receives while playing Call of Duty

But the case of Jenny Haniver could prove instructive.

Ms Haniver plays Call of Duty - a FPS game - daily with her friends, as she has done for years - even though she is often subjected to harassment when men discover that she's a woman, as she told the BBC in 2012.

But, recently, Call of Duty introduced an option to play as a female character.

Now, she says ""everyone I know when given the option will play as female characters"" - including some men, who have also lobbied for more female characters and a reduction of both hypersexualised female and male characters.

Xbox One owners are complaining that a new TV advert is switching their consoles on without their permission.

The ad - featuring Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul - has the actor say ""Xbox On"" near its start.

The instruction appears to trigger the machine's Kinect voice/motion sensor, activating the console.

A spokesman for the firm said it had no comment at this time, but noted that previous ads had also featured voice commands.

Many people have posted comments about the problem on social media sites.

""Aaron Paul just turned my Xbox One via the Xbox advert. (Which triggered the IR [infrared] blaster to switch my TV off..)"" tweeted Qassim Farid, a UK-based tech blogger.

Chesterfield-based Tom Neal wrote: ""@Xbox your new TV advert is annoying the hell outta me. Aaron Paul keeps turning my console on… #stooooop""

The effect has also been noted on news discussion site Reddit's Xbox section, with one commentator writing: ""Damn commercial keeps turning on my xbox! Lol""

Image copyright Microsoft Image caption The Xbox One's Kinect sensor features microphones and colour and infrared cameras

The post reflects the attitude of many console owners who have posted about the matter who appear more bemused than angered by the glitch.

This is not the first time such an effect has been reported.

In November Xbox One owner Tim Kimberl posted a video to YouTube showing that an internet ad that featured the command ""Xbox go to Dead Rising 3"" launched the game on his system.

Users affected by the issue do have the ability to turn off the Kinect sensor, which prevents the console responding to voice commands.

The issue has parallels with an effect played for laughs in the TV series 30 Rock where a voice-controlled television went haywire when on-screen characters mentioned its trigger words.

Unbundled Kinect

The problem has arisen in the same week that Microsoft began selling a cheaper version of the Xbox One without the Kinect.

It said it made the move - timed to coincide with the E3 video games expo - following feedback from gamers who did not want to pay extra for the accessory.

The decision allows the machine to retail at the same price as Sony's PlayStation 4.

Microsoft's press event at the Los Angeles show was notable for hardly featuring the Kinect.

However, Microsoft did announce outside the show that a software update would soon allow developers access to more graphics power when the Kinect was not in use. This may help address complaints that several cross-platform games offer higher resolutions and frame rates on the PS4 than their Xbox equivalents.

London is blowing its tech trumpet in a big way this week.

Boris Johnson, along with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and the venture capitalist Sir Michael Moritz, have just launched London Technology Week - a series of events designed to boost the reputation of the capital as a technology cluster. And if you were to believe some startling research commissioned for the week, London is already hitting it out of the park.

A report by Oxford Economics claims there are 34,000 tech businesses in London now, and in the next decade there will be another 11,000, creating 46,000 new jobs. (The fact that TechCity only released one page of the whole report makes it difficult to assess this claim).

Another report by two academics makes an even more startling claim - that there are now more technology and information workers in London and South East England than in the whole of California. So relax everybody, we've got Silicon Valley on the run.

Well, not quite. Some caution needs to be applied, first of all as to what constitutes a technology business or worker. There is some suspicion that all kinds of marketing and PR jobs are being included, and when you ask for examples of really hi-tech businesses in London they are thin on the ground.

Then when you look for London start-ups that have made it big as independent businesses there is still not much to crow about. The biggest UK success story of recent years has been ARM, the microprocessor designer, but it was born and grew up in Cambridge, not London. Asos and Betfair were the two names bandied about at the Technology Week launch, but both were founded long before the whole TechCity project got underway.

When I put it to Boris Johnson that he as a classical scholar might sense a degree of hubris about the claims, he agrees that this is a danger: ""There is no reason for hubris when you consider that… we haven't yet produced the kind of knockout multi-billion pound businesses that we see in Silicon Valley."" He muses on why that might be the case - is there a British diffidence about making money, is the venture capital industry not as imaginative as it might be?

There is of course one very imaginative venture capitalist at the event, Sequoia's Sir Michael Moritz. Born in Wales, then a journalist in the US, he spotted the potential of Google and Yahoo at an early stage, and so became one of Silicon Valley's wealthiest venture capitalists.

Image copyright PA Image caption Silicon Roundabout - the centre of London's tech ambitions

I've always wondered whether London could prosper without better links between TechCity and local universities, but Sir Michael thinks the answer lies in looking at a wider area: ""London is beautifully situated, with Oxford and Cambridge being an astonishingly fertile triangle of scientific, engineering and mathematical knowledge,"" he says. He feels there are also grounds for optimism in the willingness of young people here to take the risk of starting their own business, something that had not been the case when he left the UK.

I think there's now an opportunity... to do something really crazy - to provide wifi internet access, 3G access for free in the whole country Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna

It does seem to be the case that some technology companies are being started in Oxford or Cambridge, and then moving to London for higher profile and better access to capital - one example is Swiftkey, which uses machine learning to make typing on a mobile easier. But there is still a funding gap - seed finance is plentiful, but there is a scarcity of cash for firms wanting to move to the next stage.

Sir Michael insists that Silicon Valley investors like him will always find a way to detect talent - ""people like us are only an email away"" - but so far Sequoia has not backed a London tech firm. Sitting alongside him as we speak, is someone he has backed - Sebastian Siemiatkowski of the Swedish payments firm Klarna.

I'd met Mr Siemiatkowski a few weeks ago and been very impressed with technology that makes it far simpler to pay for goods online. Klarna is already taking on PayPal in its home market in Sweden, has a big presence in Germany, and arrives in the UK next month.

He politely joins in with the acclaim for London - he is after all investing a large amount to bring Klarna here - but then explains why his home town Stockholm has been so successful. He says it is all about public investment in infrastructure dating back to the early 1990s, first giving free PCs to poorer households, then providing fast broadband.

He has this advice for London: ""I think there's now an opportunity for some tech hub - wherever that might be - to do something really crazy, which is to provide wifi internet access, 3G access for free in the whole country."" The first one to do that, he said, would really drive innovation.

There are certainly reasons to be cheerful about London as a technology superstar, and the mere fact that there is so much hype about what are right now quite slender achievements, is helping to draw successful companies like Sweden's Klarna and Cambridge's Swiftkey to the capital.

But consider this when you hear that London is growing faster than Silicon Valley. Last week, one relatively young San Francisco start-up, Uber, received $1.2bn of new funding - that's about £700m. The British Venture Capital Association tells me that in 2012 - the most recent year for which they have figures - £681m was invested in the whole UK technology sector.

Sites like Google and Bing Maps will be able to use higher-quality satellite images, thanks to US government restrictions being lifted.

Companies had not been allowed to make use of images where features smaller than 50cm were visible.

But one imaging firm, Digital Globe, said it would be able to sell images that showed features as small as 31cm.

One lawyer told the BBC he expected ""repercussions"" from people worried about their privacy.

Marc Dautlich, from Pinsent Masons, said there may be ""national security considerations"" to address as well.

Currently, some sensitive locations around the world are obscured or blurred on mapping websites.

The decision was made after Digital Globe applied to the US Department of Commerce asking for restrictions to be lifted.

'Manholes and mailboxes'

Digital Globe said new satellites would be launched to take advantage of the ruling.

The company's Worldview-3 satellite is due to launch in August and will be able to show ""key features such as manholes and mailboxes"".

""In the past, collecting sub-50cm resolution required chartering and flying aircraft,"" the company said.

""This is expensive, time-consuming, and can be limited by denied airspace or dangerous conditions.""

Jeffrey Tarr, Digital Globe's chief executive, said: ""We are very pleased and appreciative that the US Department of Commerce has made this forward-leaning change to our nation's policy that will fuel innovation, create new high-tech jobs, and advance the nation's commanding lead in this strategically important industry.

""Our customers will immediately realise the benefits of this updated regulation, as for the first time, we will be able to make our very best imagery available to the commercial market.""

As well as for general public use, the higher-quality images can have other uses, the company said, such as aiding agriculture efforts and disaster relief.

Google recently announced it was planning to purchase an alternative satellite imaging company, Skybox, for $500m (£295m). The company currently has one satellite in orbit - SkySat-1 - but hopes to eventually launch a total of 24.

Internet TV service YouView may have to change its name after the High Court ruled it had infringed another company's trademark.

Telecoms firm Total registered the name YourView for one of its online portal products in 2006.

A judge ruled that YouView was ""confusingly similar"" to YourView.

Total said it would now apply for an injunction to prevent further use of the YouView brand. YouView said it planned to appeal.

In a statement, YouView said: ""We maintain there is no confusion between our consumer-facing TV service, YouView, and the business-to-business billing platform, Yourview, provided by Total Ltd.""

But Total's lawyer Paul Gordon said: ""Total's rights were plainly infringed and it had to stand firm against a much larger and better-funded opponent.

""YouView were made well aware of Total's rights before they launched the service under the infringing name yet they chose to launch it under that name regardless.""

Total added it would now seek an injunction to ""prevent any further use of the name YouView, together with financial payment and legal costs"".

There is enough evidence for a man accused of running a website showing thousands of images of naked women without their consent to be put on trial, a San Diego judge has ruled.

Kevin Bollaert is accused of running so-called revenge porn website UGotPosted and changemyreputation.com, a second site which offered to remove the images for about $300 (£176) each.

He faces identity theft charges as UGotPosted included victims' locations, names and links to Facebook profiles.

The 27-year-old has pleaded not guilty.

He is also charged with obtaining identifying information with the intent to annoy or harass.

The term revenge porn refers to websites that allow people to post explicit images of former partners, either obtained consensually or stolen from online accounts.

According to court documents, Mr Bollaert told investigators he had made ""around $900 per month"" from advertising on UGotPosted but records obtained from his PayPal account indicate he received payments totalling tens of thousands of dollars.

Law makers around the world are looking at ways to crack down on the practice of posting explicit images of former lovers, either obtained consensually during a relationship or stolen from online accounts.

The UK faces a worsening gender gap in its flourishing IT industry, according to a new study.

The Women in IT scorecard looked at gender trends from secondary education through to the work place.

It indicates women account for just 16% of the UK IT workforce.

And the problem starts early - despite consistently out-performing boys in computing A-level results, girls account for just 6.5% of those taking the exam.

The study was compiled by BCS, the chartered institute for IT, and E-skills UK.

Other highlights from the report include:

Girls account for just 13% of entries for computer science GCSEs

The proportion of women working as self-employed IT specialists has doubled over the past decade

Apple has agreed an out-of-court settlement in a case in which it was being sued by consumers who overpaid for e-books due to price-fixing between the tech giant and publishers.

A court document filed in New York says a ""binding agreement"" has been reached.

The amount of compensation offered by Apple is not revealed, but the litigants were thought to have been seeking up to $840m (£495m).

Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing over e-book pricing.

The impending trial, in which 33 US states and territories were seeking reparations from Apple on behalf of their citizens, was linked to a separate ruling last year, where a judge said Apple had violated anti-trust laws by striking deals to enable them to charge a higher price for some e-books in its online store.

As well as the authorities taking action, several individuals from across the US were also seeking compensation for overpaying in their e-book purchases.

The allegation was that Apple, a distributor of e-books, had illegally conspired with five of the biggest publishers to stop Amazon - a dominant force in the market - selling titles at a loss.

Previously, publishers had sold e-books to distributors at a wholesale price, with retailers such as Amazon and Apple able to set their own sale prices.

But the court case heard that the publishers (Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Penguin Group (USA) Inc, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster Inc) had agreed with Apple to move to an ""agency model,"" in which the publishers agree a minimum retail price with distributors, thus preventing them from offering titles at a loss.

However Apple denied that it was involved in price-fixing, accusing plaintiffs of ""false accusations"", and is in the process of challenging last July's ruling.

The publishers agreed to pay more than $166m to settle charges brought against them.

The out-of-court settlement marks an about-turn from Apple, whose chief executive, Tim Cook, had previously dismissed the idea of reaching an agreement.

The firm declined to comment on the decision.

207,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Revelations by Edward Snowden show that GCHQ snooping goes too far, say campaigners

UK intelligence service GCHQ can legally snoop on British use of Google, Facebook and web-based email without specific warrants because the firms are based abroad, the government has said.

Classed as ""external communications"", such activity can be covered by a broad warrant and intercepted without extra clearance, spy boss Charles Farr said.

The policy was revealed as part of a legal battle with campaign group Privacy International (PI).

PI labelled the policy ""patronising"".

It is the first time the UK has commented on how its legal framework allows the mass interception of communications, as outlined by US whistleblower Edward Snowden in his leaks about global government surveillance.

The former National Security Agency contractor revealed extensive details of internet and phone snooping and has since fled the US and sought temporary asylum in Russia.

Charles Farr, director general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, told PI that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and web searches on Google - as well as webmail services such as Hotmail and Yahoo - were classified as ""external communications"", which meant they could be intercepted without the need for additional legal clearance.

Internal communications between citizens can only be intercepted when a targeted warrant is issued. Warrants must be signed by a minister and can only be issued when there is suspicion of illegal activity.

But when someone searches for something on Google or posts on Facebook they are sending information overseas - constituting an act of external communication that could be collected under a broader warrant which does not need to be signed by a minister, explained Mr Farr in a 48-page written statement.

However, he said data collected in this way ""cannot be read, looked at or listened to"" except in strictly limited circumstances.

Mr Farr said there was a ""significant distinction"" between intercepting material and a person actually reading, looking at or listening it.

Although this is the first time Mr Farr has publicly commented on the matter, the issue was previously raised by privacy researcher Caspar Bowden.

He briefed the House of Lords in 2000 ahead of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act coming into effect, which granted GCHQ the relevant power.

However, he told the BBC that his testimony was only presented to a near-empty House of Lords and was not reported outside of Hansard.

Analysis - Gordon Corera, security correspondent

British intelligence has always said that its activities are lawful.

But one of the problems has been that the law surrounding interception is incredibly hard to understand. Charles Farr's statement provides new details of how the government believes it applies to different forms of communications.

It reveals that a Google search by someone in Britain may be considered an external communication because the request and the result go abroad to Google's computers.

That means it could be swept up under the broader warrant covering ""external ""communications.

However, Mr Farr says that actually reading or examining a Briton's communications swept up in this way would still require a domestic, more targeted warrant.

Much of the debate over whether the state does conduct mass surveillance comes down to a central question - does the act of computers collecting information constitute surveillance or does it take a person reading or accessing that data for someone's privacy to be invaded?

Speak to privacy advocates and government officials and you get a radically different answer.

Mr Farr did not reveal the extent to which GCHQ used its power to intercept external communications.

In a statement, GCHQ said all its work was ""carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate"".

'Byzantine' laws

But civil liberty groups were outraged by the revelations.

James Welch, legal director of human rights group Liberty, said: ""The security services consider that they're entitled to read, listen and analyse all our communications on Facebook, Google and other US-based platforms.

""If there was any remaining doubt that our snooping laws need a radical overhaul there can be no longer.""

Meanwhile, Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said the revelation showed that spy agencies operated under their own laws.

""Intelligence agencies cannot be considered accountable to Parliament and to the public they serve when their actions are obfuscated through secret interpretations of Byzantine laws.""

But some others did not find the revelations surprising.

Alan Woodward, a security expert who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ, said: ""I think what is happening is that people are just becoming familiar with legislation that has been in place for many years, probably because of all the civil liberty groups raising concerns. As you can see from the Act, it has never been a secret.

""The bit that people tend to forget is that RIPA [Regulation of Investigatory Powers] has protections as well, something you won't find in many other countries. The difference in the UK is that civil liberty organisations have the right to challenge these things, a right which they would not have in, say, Russia.""

However, Mr Bowden suggested the relevant statute had been obscurely worded.

""Interpreting that section requires the unravelling of a triple-nested inversion of meanings across six cross-referenced subsections, linked to a dozen other cross-linked definitions, which are all dependent on a highly ambiguous 'notwithstanding',"" he said.

The legal challenge, brought by PI, Amnesty, the American Civil Liberties Union and six other national civil liberties organisations, was a direct response to the revelations made by Mr Snowden about the UK's global digital surveillance.","Google and Facebook can be legally intercepted, says UK spy boss",http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75593000/jpg/_75593395_021483548-1.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27887639

A spokesperson for the indie labels said YouTube was making a ""grave error of commercial judgment"".

YouTube said it was bringing ""new revenue streams"" to the music industry.

Facebook has launched a photo-messaging app one week after accidentally releasing it on Apple's app store.

Known as Slingshot, the app's features include sharing photos and videos with friends and sending ""reaction shots"".

It uses an unlocking mechanism, whereby photos received from friends must be unlocked by ""slinging"" a different photo back to the original sender.

Like Snapchat, all images are deleted once sent and users can scribble or type over their photos.

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Before viewing a received photo, the user must send back one of their own

On the social media page for the app, the creators said: ""With Slingshot, we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator.

""When everyone participates, there's less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences.""

The app is developed by Facebook's Creative Labs division, which has been tasked with creating new and innovative products.

Slingshot users do not need to have a Facebook account to sign up for the photo-messaging app. They can access the app with their mobile phone number and connect with friends in their phone's contact list, or they can connect via their Facebook friends' list.

Snapchat competitor?

The Slingshot launch comes as Facebook is trying to fight off threats from other social networking agents, which also contain messaging and photo-sharing tools.

In addition to developing its own apps, Facebook has also been on an acquisition spree.

In 2012 Facebook bought photo-sharing network Instagram for $1bn (£589m).

A year later, it was reported that Snapchat rejected a $3bn bid from Facebook, revealing the social media giant's apparent continued and serious interest in photo-messaging services.

Previously Facebook attempted and failed to create a successful image-messaging app called Poke, which was recently abandoned and had been described by some as a ""blatant copycat app.""

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Until an image is unlocked, the recipient only sees a pixelated version

However, unlike Poke, Slingshot has a number of unique features not found in rivals such as Snapchat, which could help it distinguish itself.

In addition to the unlock requirement, Slingshot features a ""select all"" function, which allows people to send a picture to all their contacts at the same time.

As the Verge news site notes, Snapchat has deliberately avoided offering such a facility to avoid its users becoming overwhelmed with alerts.

Another similar app and potential rival is Taptalk, which is reportedly admired among some Facebook engineers.

Taptalk provides a comparatively minimalist and simplified approach to image messaging, allowing users to send personal pictures or videos by tapping or holding their friend's profile picture.

It has also been noted that Slingshot's icon is strikingly similar to Taptalk's.

Twitter has unblocked access to dozens of accounts and specific tweets that it had made unavailable in Pakistan.

The social network had imposed the restrictions last month after complaints from the country's telecoms authority that the material was ""blasphemous"" and ""unethical.""

Many of the examples mocked Islam.

Twitter said it had now dropped the ban because the watchdog had not followed up its initial requests with further documentation.

It publicised the move by informing Chilling Effects, a website that keeps track of cease-and-desist demands sent to internet-based organisations.

""On May 18, 2014, we made an initial decision to withhold content in Pakistan based on information provided to us by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority,"" Twitter told the site.

""Consistent with our longstanding policies we provided notice to all of the affected account holders and published the actioned takedown requests on Chilling Effects to maximise transparency regarding our decision.

""We have re-examined the requests and, in the absence of additional clarifying information from Pakistani authorities, have determined that restoration of the previously withheld content is warranted.""

Banned content

Twitter introduced the ability to selectively block tweets on a country-by-country basis in 2012 - a move criticised at the time by freedom-of-speech organisations, including Reporters Without Borders.

Twitter received five batches of complaints from Pakistan in May, according to the information provided to Chilling Effects.

The former world number five snooker player Stephen Lee has been fined for selling his personal cue to a Facebook fan for £1,600 but failing to send it.

The victim, based in Hong Kong, paid the money into Lee's wife's bank account after Lee agreed to arrange for modifications to be made to the cue.

The money was transferred but the player, 39, continued using the cue.

Lee pleaded guilty to fraud at Swindon Magistrates' Court and was fined £110 and ordered to repay the £1,600.

'Drop the charges'

The court heard that when there was no sign of the snooker cue Marco Fai Pak Shek made a report to the police.

Prosecutor Michelle Hewitt told the court Lee had promised to send the cue along with letters of authenticity from himself and cue manufacturer John Parris but when the police carried out an investigation he was still using the cue as his own personal property.

Lee, who lives in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was then arrested.

Ms Hewitt said Lee emailed Mr Shek saying he was going to personally deliver the cue.

The email read: ""If you want the cue, you need to drop the charges and I will sign some pictures for you.""

Mr Shek refused to drop the charges and the case continued.

Mark Glendenning, for Lee, said his client had repeatedly apologised for failing to send the cue and had previously sold items to fans on his Facebook site without incident.

He said Lee had found himself embroiled in a number of difficulties which had taken up his time but ""accepts in full he should have sent this cue"".

Mr Swaibu, 25, of Tooley Street, Bermondsey, south London, denies a single count of conspiracy to offer, promise or give a financial advantage.

He was granted unconditional bail pending a retrial.

'No doubt'

Sankaran, 33, of Hougang Avenue, Singapore and Ganeshan, 44, a British national originally from Sri Lanka, of Hawthorn Road, Hastings, East Sussex, were described during their trial as the ""central figures"" in influencing the outcome of matches in League Two and the Conference South. in November last year.

Mr Adelakun, 23, of Thornton Heath, south London, told the jury at Birmingham Crown Court that he knew nothing at all about any plot to fix matches.

The Crown alleged at the start of the trial that Sankaran and Sri Lankan-born Ganeshan conspired to fix matches they intended to place bets on.

Prosecutor Robert Davies said Sankaran and Ganeshan travelled to the UK from Singapore intending to target non-league conference football.

They intended to use the minimum level of bribe to get the maximum betting return, the court heard.

""They've come across to the UK with a plan to find lower league players willing to take a bribe or encourage other players to do so,"" Mr Davies told the jury.

A National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation began when the Daily Telegraph presented the agency with evidence from an undercover investigation.

NCA branch commander Richard Warner said: ""The NCA is in no doubt that Ganeshan and Sankaran were at the very beginning of a concerted attempt to build a network of corrupt players in the UK.

""Their aim was to influence play so that they could make spot bets and manipulate scorelines to generate large sums of money.

""They clearly had links to business-like networks overseas.""

Boateng, 22, of Davidson Road, Croydon, south London, Sankaran and Ganeshan are due to be sentenced on Friday.

A couple's bizarre attempts to fill a World Cup sticker album with their own, sometimes ""awful"", drawings of players have become an unlikely internet hit.

Alex and Sian Pratchett began drawing players on the opening day of the World Cup and aim to finish by the final.

They posted the images on a blog called Panini Cheapskates, with an especially noteworthy drawing of Germany's Mesut Özil among those winning acclaim.

Mr Pratchett said: ""It's taken over our life - it's like a second job.""

He confessed the idea was ""completely ridiculous"", but it has attracted worldwide interest.

The crayon king said he had tried to complete the 1994 Panini World Cup album when he was 11, but ""never quite did it"".

And as overgrown schoolboys everywhere took the opportunity afforded by the World Cup in Brazil to relive their youth of sticker swapsies, a Panini album found its way to the Pratchetts' Oxford home.

In the week before Wimbledon, many of the world's best tennis players are eager to get some last minute competitive practice. But how has the quiet Sussex coastal town of Eastbourne become the place so many of them go to get it?

Eastbourne has a population of about 100,000 people and is famous for the cliffs of Beachy Head, its sunny weather and high levels of retired people.

But for the past four decades it has hosted one of the world's most important grass court tennis tournaments.

The women's championship, first held in 1974, is rated as a ""premier"" tournament. Other WTA competitions with the same status are held in Sydney, Paris, Dubai, Tokyo and Moscow - all places with a slightly higher world profile than Eastbourne, however attractive the floral arrangements on its seafront may be.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The venue's intimate nature has always given fans the chance to be close to stars such as Ana Ivanovic, who says it is one of the players' favourite tournaments because of the ""impeccable grass courts""

Image caption Devonshire Park club chairman Ken Pollock says he calls Eastbourne ""Tennis Town""

Among the famous names who have held trophies aloft by the seaside are Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Virginia Wade, Justine Henin, Kim Clijsters, Andy Roddick, Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles, Caroline Wozniacki and current Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli.

So how has the relatively little town carved itself such an important role in the sporting calendar?

Ken Pollock, chairman of the Devonshire Park Lawn Tennis Club, where the tournament is played, said: ""It's an important venue because of the quality of the grass courts, the weather - it's known as the sunshine coast - and there's ample hotel accommodation.

""I go out to schools to talk about the tournament and I bill it as the ""tennis town"". There's nothing else like it in the country.

""Eastbourne stands alone - there isn't another town which is just famous for its tennis. It marks it out as quite a remarkable place.""

Small town, big sporting event

•Eastbourne - population 99,412, hosts a major pre-Wimbledon tennis tournament

•Epsom - population 75,102, hosts The Derby

•Hoylake - population 13,348, hosting the 2014 Open golf

•Shepton Mallet - population 10,369, hosted boxing matches featuring Frank Bruno and Naseem Hamed in 1995

British number three Johanna Konta, who lives in Eastbourne and is ranked 110th in the world, said: ""Obviously for me it's more special than for most of the players - it's one of the few chances I get to sleep in my own bed and eat my mum's cooking.

""But other players find it a very nice tournament and that's why there are always some of the world's top players taking part, and why they keep coming back.""

Of course, Eastbourne is not the only small English town to host a major sporting event. The Derby is held in Epsom, the Open golf visits locations as obscure as Hoylake and Sandwich and Formula 1's British Grand Prix is held in Silverstone - population 2,176.

But horse racing, golf and motor racing each have to be played in huge areas, meaning they are by nature more likely to be away from urban sprawl, unlike tennis - whose most famous homes are the grand slam venues of London, Paris, New York and Melbourne.

""There are more glamorous locations on tour, but everyone seems to love a seaside resort and Eastbourne remains popular - despite the chilly wind that can blow through Devonshire Park on occasions,"" says Russell Fuller, the BBC's tennis correspondent.

""After up to a fortnight in Paris, and ahead of two weeks at Wimbledon, Eastbourne provides a pleasant respite to city life.

""Fewer of the very top seeds opt to play a grass court warm up event these days, but it looks as if a healthy number of top 10 players will be in attendance once again.""

'I was an Eastbourne ball girl' by Libby Sutcliffe, BBC News

I was just a teenage schoolgirl (above, second from right) in the late 1980s when I was given the chance to stand opposite some of the world's top female tennis players.

Dozens of girls at The Cavendish School in Eastbourne were picked to be ball girls at the tennis tournament that comes to the town every year.

Among the stars I threw tennis balls to were Martina Navratilova and Jennifer Capriati and I also ball girled one of the last professional games Chris Evert played in.

It was a huge honour to share the centre court with some of the biggest names in the sport and we had to complete months of training to make sure we threw and rolled the balls effortlessly. We were called the unsung heroes of the event and we knew we were doing a good job if no-one noticed us.

There were occasional slip ups - score boards falling over, sunburn and seagull poo splattered on a bright white skirt. Once I was stuck crouching at the net for 14 games when the umpire forgot to shout ""new balls please"" when it got to seven. My legs did ache.

It was truly an amazing experience and I developed a knowledge and love of tennis that has stayed with me ever since. It meant for one week a year we could escape the classroom, forgot we were just teenagers, mix with the talented and famous and even appear on the TV.

Although the tournament in its current format dates back 40 years, tennis has been played at the venue for far longer.

Mr Pollock said the park opened on 1 July 1874 and he thinks the first championships was held there in 1881, with the tennis club starting about the same sort of time.

""The current tournament came out of the South of England Lawn Tennis Championship, which was held down here in Eastbourne,"" he said.

""The likes of Fred Perry and Rene Lacoste and co would have taken part - it was quite a prestigious tournament.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The tournament had high-profile winners from the start, including Martina Navratilova and Tracey Austin

The tournament has always attracted many of the world's top players. This year's event will see five of the women's top 10 players in action - previous winner, world number four and former Wimbledon runner-up Agnieszka Radwanska is top seed.

Victoria Azarenka, twice Australian Open winner, is making her comeback from injury at Eastbourne and 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, ranked sixth in the world, is also playing, along with seventh and ninth-ranked Jelena Jankovic and Angelique Kerber.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The tournament's prestige made Eastbourne the unlikely venue for the launch of a bra advertising campaign with Russian star Anna Kournikova in 2000, when she was at the height of her worldwide fame

Top seed in the men's tournament is world number 14 Richard Gasquet, a former semi-finalist at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Martina Navratilova, the most successful female player of all time, lifted the trophy in Eastbourne 11 times.

Navratilova became so closely associated with the town she was awarded the freedom of Eastbourne in 2005, when she said: ""I am deeply moved by such genuine kindness... and now I truly feel I am a part of such a noble community.

""The appreciation is mutual. I appreciate Eastbourne, Eastbourne appreciates me and it's nice when it's symbiotic like that, it kind of makes you feel good.""

She said the players walked around among the fans, who could also watch the top stars practise.

""It's all right there, it's not so spread out. The players can interact with the fans and the kids and that's what it should be.""

""We also have to accommodate all the support staff, the catering workers, and the bigger hotels - the four and five star hotels - host the players and their entourages, if they have any. The LTA (Lawn Tennis Association) tends to pick a hotel for the players.

Plans to develop a major gas discovery in the North Sea have taken a step forward after Maersk Oil UK announced details of a new stand-alone facility for the Culzean field.

The bridge-linked complex will include a wellhead platform, central processing facility and living quarters.

KBR London has been selected as front end engineering design (Feed) contractor for the facility.

Overall investment in the project is expected to be more than £3bn.

Culzean is an ultra-high-pressure, high-temperature field located about 145 miles east of Aberdeen.

The new facility will support production of the Culzean discovery and is expected to serve as a hub for a new development cluster in the surrounding area.

Phased installation

Subject to a final investment decision in 2015, a phased installation of the facilities will begin in 2016.

If successfully developed, the field is expected to provide about 5% of the UK's total gas consumption by 2020/21.

First gas from the project is currently expected in 2019.

Danish-owned Maersk is the field operator, with a 49.99% stake, while JX Nippon and Britoil (BP) are co-venturers.

Maersk Oil UK managing director Martin Rune Pederson said: ""We're pleased to make this announcement today, which means the project is progressing as planned.

""Culzean is a key growth project for Maersk Oil, but can also be an important new resource for the UK in terms of its potential to support energy security and employment.""

He added: ""We also hope and expect that these new facilities will not only support production of the Culzean discovery, but serve as a hub for a new development cluster in the surrounding region.

An international competition for students to design video games is underway in Dundee.

Hundreds of teams are expected to enter Dare to be Digital and bid to build a working game prototype in eight weeks.

This year's competition was launched by Sophia George, the V&A museum's Games Designer in Residence and a former Dare to be Digital winner.

Games by the 15 finalists will go on show to the public and industry experts in August.

The three main awards at the competition, run by Abertay University, are sponsored by PlayStation First, the academic development programme of Sony.

Teams from across the globe have travelled to Scotland for this year's contest, from as far afield as China, India, Malta and the USA.

Fifteen will be chosen to develop games, which the public get the chance to play at the Dare ProtoPlay festival in August, also in Dundee.

Three winning teams are then put forward to compete for a Bafta Ones to Watch Award.

'Incredibly tough'

Sophia George's team won that award in 2012 after triumphing in the previous year's Dare to be Digital contest.

219,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Modi faces significant challenges in revitalising India's flagging economy

India has witnessed a historic parliamentary election in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has scored an absolute majority for the first time and the Congress has won less than 10% of the seats.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi now heads the first government in 25 years that is not hostage to coalition politics.

How should he use this majority to restore and accelerate economic growth, the principal means to eradicating poverty and bringing prosperity to all, as promised during the campaign?

The first thing the government needs to do is to remove the bottlenecks that have stifled the economy and cut its growth to half of the true potential.

This would require appointing a pragmatic environment minister - Prakash Javadekar, the current minister, meets the qualification but holds the charge temporarily - who would judiciously balance the need for environmental protection against the need for growth.

It also requires reassuring the bureaucracy to fearlessly move ahead with all legitimate decisions.

Forging partnerships

If necessary, the relevant laws must be amended to achieve better balance between the protection of honest officers and prosecution of the dishonest ones. Simultaneously, recalcitrant bureaucrats must be warned that obstructionism will invite swift retribution.

Mr Modi must also push ahead with forging partnerships with chief ministers interested in seeing their states grow faster.

He must consider creating a ""single-window"" facility in co-operation with these states so that central and state-level clearances for major projects can move on parallel tracks.

Chief ministers interested in moving forward should be rewarded, not punished in the name of regional equality. The latter should be targeted using alternative instruments such as fiscal transfers.

Immediately, the government must also move to remove the barriers to coal and gas supplies that are forcing power plants to operate at low capacity.

Image copyright AP Image caption India's new government faces calls to amend the land acquisition law

This requires bringing private players with modern technology to mine coal and linking remote mines in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa states to the existing transport network by building about 300km (186 miles) of railway lines. Pricing disputes holding back gas production must be quickly resolved.

The budget for 2014-15, due for presentation in parliament in early July, offers an excellent opportunity for the government to boldly state the new direction it intends to impart the economy.

The budget should commit to completing the uniform goods-and-services tax within two years and to simplifying and codifying direct tax rules within one year.

The current tax rules are ill defined and give the tax authorities far too much discretion, leading to unexpected demands by tax officials and frequent disputes. The budget must also end the retrospective tax - designed to net levies from foreign transactions involving Indian companies - introduced in 2012, making the relevant law prospective.

The government needs to forge ahead with accelerating infrastructure building.

This will require, first and foremost, the amendment of the current draconian land acquisition law.

Weak banks

The budget must also begin the process of restoring the health of public-sector banks.

Restructured and non-performing loans of these banks now stand at nearly 10%, undermining their capacity to issue new credit.

The government should take this opportunity to enhance efficiency. Rather than rely exclusively on recapitalisation, it should lower the current floor of 51% on its share in equity and allow the banks to raise capital from the market.

In addition, it should merge some of the weaker banks with stronger ones other than the State Bank of India (SBI).

This will promote consolidation and competition in banking. The banking sector is currently fragmented with far too many small banks and one gigantic one, the SBI.

The budget must also commit the government to giving states greater fiscal and legislative space.

The former will involve cutting and consolidating centrally sponsored schemes under a handful of broad headings such as education, health and infrastructure and allowing the states to shift funds across schemes within each broad category as per local needs.

The latter will require time-bound presidential assent to states to amend central legislations on subjects listed on the Concurrent list of the Constitution.

Image copyright AFP Image caption India needs to boost its economic growth in order to create jobs for those entering the labour market

In the medium run, the government has no option but to undertake reforms necessary to make it attractive for entrepreneurs to invest in low-skilled, labour-intensive manufacturing such as apparel, footwear and electronic assembly.

With a workforce that exceeds 450 million and is largely without sophisticated skills, inclusion will remain partial without robust growth in these industries.

Poor performance of India along this dimension is demonstrated by the fact that apparel exports by it are less than one-tenth of those by China and even less than those by Bangladesh.

As China exits these industries because of higher wages, they are moving to countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Indonesia but not India.

India has little option but to reform its labour laws that have been identified as the fundamental barriers to the growth of employment-intensive manufacturing.

In providing super-high protection to the small number of workers in the organised sector - as opposed to India's much-larger informal sector - the country has sacrificed a high number of jobs.

Mr Modi's government must find a better balance between the protection of workers and creation of good jobs in vast numbers.

F1 champion Michael Schumacher has left hospital in Grenoble and is no longer in a coma, his family says.

The 45-year-old has been transferred to Lausanne university hospital in Switzerland, officials there say.

Schumacher was placed in a medically induced coma after suffering a severe head injury in a skiing accident in the French Alps on 29 December.

His family thanked people who had sent messages of support, saying: ""We are sure it helped him.""

They also praised the ""excellent job"" of medical staff at the hospital in Grenoble, in south-east France.

Doctors had kept the seven-time champion in a coma to help reduce swelling in his brain.

""Michael has left the CHU Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation. He is not in a coma anymore,"" Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, said in a statement on behalf of his family on Monday.

""For the future we ask for understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye,"" she said, without giving further details.

Relatives have previously warned that ""it was clear from the start that this will be a long and hard fight for Michael"".

The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva reports that the university hospital in Lausanne is one of Switzerland's most renowned.

He will have a team of specialists, and his own private accommodation, and he will be much closer to his family home on the shores of Lake Geneva, our correspondent says.

But it is not clear what Schumacher's condition is and his process of recovery is still expected to be a long one, she adds.

Monday's statement was the first substantial update since early April when Ms Kehm said the German racing driver was showing ""moments of consciousness and awakening.""

Medically induced coma

Can be induced by powerful anaesthetics and is broadly similar to the sedation and artificial ventilation used during surgery

Used to shut down many brain functions, lowering blood flow and pressure

Taking a patient out of an induced coma is a delicate process, especially after a prolonged period of sedation

Neurosurgeon Tony Belli told the BBC that rehabilitation from this sort of injury could take months or years.

""We know that some people can spend three, four years in rehabilitation,"" he said. ""It depends very much on the severity of the injury, how young and fit they are.""

Meanwhile, the German football team sent their wishes to the F1 legend from the World Cup in Brazil at the weekend.

Lukas Podolski, the Arsenal striker, told a news conference: ""I'd like to greet a good friend, who unfortunately is unable to be here. He is Michael Schumacher.

""He is just as crazy about football as all of us. We wish his family a lot of strength. If we win the title, that would be something that would make him happy.""

Some fans are already blaming Uruguay's shock 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica on the lack of dulce de leche.

Uruguay will play England on Thursday.

The dulce de leche was seized from the team after it landed at Confins airport near their training camp in Sete Lagoas.

An official with the Brazilian agriculture department told Reuters news agency that the Uruguayans could have the dulce de leche back ""as soon as they can produce the necessary documents"".

""Or they can pick it up on their way out of Brazil,"" the official added.

It is not clear if one person carried the entire 39kg-stash or if the jars of the popular sweet paste had been distributed between the players.

Former Uruguay goalkeeper Juan Castillo said the team had also taken dulce de leche to the World Cup in South Africa, where they had not had any problems at customs.

American Airlines says it is cutting almost 80% of its flights to Venezuela from next month.

From July 2, American will operate only 10 flights per week instead of the current 48.

The move comes as part of a continuing dispute over the repatriation of revenue due to tight currency controls in the oil-rich country.

A number of airlines have already suspended or reduced the number of flights to Venezuela.

""Since we are owed a substantial outstanding amount ($750m, £442m to March 2014) and have been unable to reach resolution on the debt, we will significantly reduce our flights to the country after 1 July,"" the airline said in a statement.

American said it would only fly to Venezuela from Miami, suspending its flights from New York, Dallas and Puerto Rico.

Tight foreign currency controls make it difficult for foreign airlines to repatriate money from ticket sales in Venezuela.

The authorities have restricted access to dollars and want to make them more expensive to purchase, which may lead to losses for companies that are still waiting for cash from as far back as 2012.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates Venezuela is delaying payment of $4bn.

American Airlines is the largest foreign carrier serving Venezuela.

Air Canada has suspended service citing security concerns, while others like Lufthansa and Copa Airlines have reduced the number of tickets made available in local currency.

In January, Ecuadorean airline Tame also suspended flights to Venezuela, demanding $43m (£26m) in overdue payments for tickets.

President Nicolas Maduro said at the time that airlines that reduced their operations in Venezuela would face ""severe measures"".

""The company that leaves the country will not return while we hold power,"" said Mr Maduro.

Last month, the Venezuelan government announced a deal with six Latin American airlines that would allow them to repatriate revenue from sales in 2012 and 2013.

Strict controls over foreign exchange were first imposed in 2003, following a troubled year which saw a coup against then-President Hugo Chavez.

The government hoped to avoid capital flight, but the economic crisis of the past year has led to a shortage of foreign currency.",American Airlines cuts flights to Venezuela,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75603000/jpg/_75603127_75603126.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27895233
226,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Messi and his father have denied any wrongdoing

Prosecutors in Spain have asked a judge to drop charges of tax evasion against the Argentine football star, Lionel Messi.

They say Messi's father was responsible for his finances and not the Barcelona player.

Last year Messi appeared along with his father at a court in Spain to answer allegations that they defrauded the tax authorities of more than 4m euros.

The Messis have denied any wrongdoing.

In August they made a 5m euro ""corrective payment"", equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest.

Messi's father, Jorge, will remain under investigation. He has already assumed full responsibility for his son's tax situation.

""It is clear that Lionel A Messi did not participate in the decisions on the management and destiny of his income nor was he aware of the reach, dimension, purpose or impact of the structure of the holding (to avoid taxes),"" said prosecutor Raquel Amado in a statement.

The Argentine footballer, four times Fifa World Player of the Year, and his father are suspected of using companies abroad - in Belize and Uruguay - to sell the rights to use Lionel Messi's image, thereby circumventing tax obligations in Spain.

The allegations date back to 2007-9.

The income related to Messi's image rights included contracts with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Proctor and Gamble, and the Kuwait Food Company.",Spanish prosecutors drop tax charges against Messi,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75603000/jpg/_75603974_75603973.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27895235

The West Bank's only factory making prosthetic limbs says it's struggling to provide treatment for its Palestinian patients.

According to the World Health Organisation, Israeli controls on the import of medical supplies to the West Bank, and restrictions on the movement of patients and health workers, mean many Palestinians have difficulty accessing health services.

Israel says the restrictions are necessary security measures.

Now the Kolaykelah factory says it needs to be subsidised by the Palestinian government if it is to meet the rising cost of medical materials.

229,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The British Guiana stamp was owned by du Pont chemical empire heir John du Pont

A very rare 19th Century postage stamp from a former British colony in South America has sold for a record $9.5m (£5.6m) at auction in New York.

It took only two minutes for the British Guiana one-cent magenta stamp to be sold to an anonymous bidder,

The stamp had been sold three times before, each time setting the auction record for a single stamp.

It measures just 1in by 1in (2.5cm by 2.5cm), and had not been publicly exhibited since 1986.

Sotheby's auction house said that apart from setting a new world record price for a stamp, it was also the most expensive item by weight and size ever sold.

""Every collecting area has its Holy Grail. For stamps it is The British Guiana,"" Sotheby's wrote on its website, adding the stamp is often described as the ""most famous"" and ""most valuable"" in the world.

The stamp, printed on magenta paper, bears a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, ""We give and expect in return"".

It initially went into circulation when a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the colony's postmaster asked printers to make three stamps until the shipment arrived.

A one-cent magenta, four-cent magenta and four-cent blue were created, but only the one-cent stamp is believed to still exist.

The last owner of the famous stamp was John du Pont, heir to the du Pont chemical empire, who was convicted in 1997 of murdering an Olympic champion wrestler and died in prison in 2010.

The stamp was sold by his estate, with some proceeds to be donated to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Conservation Foundation.

It last set a record in 1980 when it was sold to du Pont for $935,000.

An 1855 Swedish stamp which sold in 1996 for $2.3m had held the previous record for a single stamp at auction.",Rare British Guiana stamp sets record at New York auction,http://www.bbc.com,[],https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/75604000/jpg/_75604823_75604822.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27890106
230,"More than 250 new emoji symbols will be coming to your smartphone after an update was made to Version 7.0 of the Unicode Standard.

A chipmunk, a dove, a thermometer and a tornado are some of the icons that have been added.

The ""Vulcan salute"" from Star Trek - described as a ""raised hand with part between middle and ring fingers"" - has also been included in the series.

A total of 2,834 new characters were added in the update.

The Emojipedia website, which lists all the available icons, does not yet have pictures available of the upcoming symbols, but has got a list of their names.

These include, ""man in business suit levitating"", ""rolled-up newspaper"" and ""triangle with rounded corners"".

They also promise the arrival of ""reversed hand with middle finger extended"", suggesting the offensive gesture will now be available to users.

It will take a while for the new icons to appear on phones and computers, as developers adapt the new software to different devices.

Unlike colourful emojis, Unicode icons are generally simple black and white drawings.

Other new symbols include the currency icon for the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat. There were also additions to existing scripts for languages from North American, China, India and other Asian countries.

According to the Unicode blog: ""Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings fonts.""

In April, Skype, the online video chat service, removed some of its emojis which have the ""potential to offend"", according to its community managers.

Some of the icons included a smiley face showing its middle finger and a woman's legs wearing high heels.

A number of Skype users complained on the site's forums about the update.

Earlier this year Apple product owners complained that the range of emojis available to them did not include enough non-white people.

""Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of colour are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,"" claimed an online petition.

In response, Katie Cotton, Apple's vice-president of worldwide corporate communications said: ""There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.""

I'm Not a Hipster is available as a free download on Xbox 360 and PS3.

The package also introduces seven new vehicles, including the Glendale, Warrener, Blade and Rhapsody, the environmentally-friendly Panto microcar and the Dubsta.

Rockstar added that the update sees ""enhancements to general game play to ensure the world is constantly evolving"".

New weapons include the Vintage Pistol and Antique Cavalry Dagger, while 12 additional tasks covering races, death matches and capture missions have also been added.

Notable game play tweaks include new paint colours, black window tints, player celebrations, difficulty displays and job bookmarks.

GTA V, which is set in ""a satirical reimagining of modern Southern California"", is the first game in the series that allows players to jump in and out of the lives of three simultaneously playable lead characters.

The game quickly became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever when it was released on 17 September taking three days to generate $1bn (£620m).

However, users complained about issues with the game following the launch including one which caused cars to lose upgrades or completely disappear from safe houses.

236,"American Justin Gatlin improved on his own world-leading 100m time, clocking 9.86 seconds at the Golden Spike meet in the Czech Republic.

The 32-year-old, who won Olympic gold in Athens in 2004, now has the four fastest times of 2014 to his name.

In Ostrava, he surged clear from the outset and improved on the 9.87secs he ran in Beijing last month, despite a head wind of 0.4 metres per second.

Mike Rodgers was second in 10.08 ahead of veteran Kim Collins in 10.12.

There were impressive performances from British athletes as 23-year-old Niall Flannery won the 400m hurdles in a new personal best of 48.80 secs, which puts him top of the British and European rankings for 2014.

Bianca Williams, 20, also set a new personal best of 22.79 secs finishing second in the 200m, just 0.04 behind 2012 Olympic champion Allyson Felix, while Williams took a further 0.14 off her best time set earlier this year.

Lawrence Clarke, 24, won the 110m hurdles in 13.50 secs, Martyn Rooney was third in the 400m in 45.03 secs, while, in the 100m, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Sean Safo-Antwi were fifth and sixth respectively in 10.19 and 10.21 secs.",Justin Gatlin sets fastest 100m time of 2014 at Golden Spike meet,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75598000/jpg/_75598556_justin_gatlin_index_epa.jpg,2014-06-18 10:50:13,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/athletics/27895245

England have confirmed that double Olympic champion Mo Farah will compete in both the 5,000m and 10,000m at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

BBC Sport revealed last week that Farah would run in both events.

Mo Farah's major medals 2013 World Championships gold (10,000m & 5,000m)

World Championships (10,000m & 5,000m) 2012 Olympic gold (10,000m & 5,000m)

Olympic (10,000m & 5,000m) 2012 European gold (5,000m)

European (5,000m) 2011 World Championships gold (5,000m) and silver (10,000m)

World Championships (5,000m) and (10,000m) 2011 European Indoor gold (3,000m)

European Indoor (3,000m) 2010 European gold (10,000m & 5,000m)

European (10,000m & 5,000m) 2009 European Indoor gold (3,000m)

European Indoor (3,000m) 2006 European silver (5,000m)

The 129-strong team includes Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford and Christine Ohuruogu, although she will only run the 4x400m relay.

Morgan Lake, 17, will compete in the women's heptathlon, but there is no place for sprinter Chijindu Ujah.

He ran the 100m in 9.96 seconds at the FBK Games in the Netherlands earlier this month, but BBC Sport understands he was not considered for the individual 100m because his effort came after the qualification cut-off period ended on 1 June.

The 20-year-old Londoner's coach was asked whether he wanted to be considered for the 4x100m relay squads, but Ujah wants to concentrate on the European Championships, which begin in Zurich shortly after the Commonwealth Games.

Adam Gemili has been selected for the 100m, along with world indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty.

Gemili believes running under 10 seconds will be the aim in order to be in with a chance of the podium.

""I finished last year as one of the quickest in Europe, so I do see myself in the mix for a medal maybe,"" Gemili said.

The 31-year-old Farah, who also won gold in both the 5000m and 10000m at the World Championships last year, made a winning return to the track in a 5,000m race in Portland on Sunday.

Ohuruogu, 30, who won 400m gold at Beijing in 2008 and silver at London 2012, has been struggling for form and finished last in the 400m at the Diamond League meeting in New York on Saturday.

With Jessica Ennis-Hill pregnant and unable to compete in Glasgow, Lake joins Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Taylor in the heptathlon.

The teenager is hoping to become the youngest track and field athlete to win an individual Commonwealth Games medal for England.

Johnson-Thompson, 21, admits it would be a ""disappointment"" not to win gold. She said: ""I think this is a breakthrough year for me - a few years ago I felt like I was totally to new to all this.""

242,"Alastair Cook is England's most prolific centurion in Tests but faces scrutiny over his captaincy

These summer months should be the sweet spot of Alastair Cook's career arc.

He has 102 Test caps and an England record of 25 centuries to his name; he is 29 years old and free of injury; and he boasts a recent past that includes Ashes won home and away and a rare Test series secured in India.

Instead, as the Test season begins against Sri Lanka on Thursday, he will walk out at Lord's as uncertain as he has been in his garlanded eight-year England career - as a batsman, as a captain, as figurehead for a new regime that is still fighting for acceptance, let alone ascendancy.

Cook's last act as Test skipper was to tow a mangled wreck of a side off the SCG outfield while opposite number Michael Clarke led his Australia side on laps of ecstatic honour.

In the inevitably dark self-analysis that followed, he admitted to doubts about his captaincy, wondering aloud whether the Ashes win at home had ""papered over some of the cracks"".

Cook's Test career in numbers 102: Tests, the joint eighth highest for England 8,047: Runs, sixth highest for England 25: Centuries - an England record 46.51: Batting average 294: Highest score 25: Age when captained England for first time 173: Score in first innings as England captain 21: Tests as captain Statistics correct on 11 June 2014

In key respects much has changed. Gone, for now at least, are the rampaging Mitchell Johnson and immovable Brad Haddin, the hectoring Australian crowds, the thousands of miles that separated him from the cool refuge of home.

In other ways he is the same captain in a near identical predicament.

Ray Illingworth, England skipper on 31 occasions, responded to being told that Mike Brearley was the country's finest captain by retorting that he was simply the luckiest, blessed to come up against feeble Australia sides with titans like Ian Botham to work miracles on his behalf.

Captains, in other words, are dependent on those they have around them. And Cook, just as he was down under, is without two of the critical figures who propelled England to the top of the world rankings: the man who took more Test wickets in five years than anyone else in world cricket, Graeme Swann, and England's most reliable number three in 25 years, Jonathan Trott.

He is also, as will be unavoidable all summer, without England's leading run-scorer of all time. In time Kevin Pietersen's enforced exile may indeed be seen as the catalyst that created a cultural cleansing. For now, there is a more straightforward question: who is going to score his runs?

With the absence of those cricketing talents comes an attendant loss in battle-hardened assistance.

At times in Australia Cook looked horribly alone, shorn of trusted lieutenants and alternative ideas. The team that trots out at Lord's is likely to be more callow yet, a collection of players looking for Test security and a standard to rally around rather than a buttress for the man at the top of the pile.

Alastair Cook scored only 246 runs at an average of 24 in England's winter Ashes whitewash, compared to 766 at 127 in the 2010-11 triumph

The best captains are made to look better by those around them. The unlucky ones are those expected to succeed in a team game on personal resolve alone.

""There's a lack of natural leadership in the side,"" former England limited-overs coach Ashley Giles admitted to Test Match Special.

""It doesn't mean we've not got good people. But your best player isn't always your best captain. Often, though, the best captains have the best sides.""

Cook's captaincy in the field so far has felt like a reflection of his own character - hard-working, straight-laced, honest.

If it could also be inflexible, attritional and short on inspiration, only now will we see how much of that reflected the style of former team director Andy Flower.

Towards the end in Australia, Cook seemed not to know himself what sort of captain he wanted to be.

England's home Test schedule 12 June: 1st Test v Sri Lanka, Lord's 20 June: 2nd Test v Sri Lanka, Headingley 9 July: 1st Test v India, Trent Bridge 17 July: 2nd Test v India, Lord's 27 July: 3rd Test v India, Southampton 7 August: 4th Test v India, Old Trafford 15 August: 5th Test v India, The Oval

Dogmatic with his bowling plans at times, he was puzzlingly quirky at others, as in Australia's successful fourth-innings run-chase in Melbourne, when he took his best bowler, Stuart Broad, out of the attack after only two overs, or gave occasional spinner Joe Root more overs at a more important time than the comparative veteran Monty Panesar.

Can a skipper reinvent himself in maturity or learn to be something he is instinctively not?

In new/old coach Peter Moores, he has an ally who likes his teams to attack and to visibly enjoy the battle, even as Moores himself will also be battling for endorsement from an expectant public.

The concern for a man who not only prefers to lead by example but was given the job primarily for that reason, is that his own performances appear to have been neutered by the cares and capriciousness of captaincy.

He made a century in each of his first two Tests in charge - deputising for Andrew Strauss in Bangladesh - and three in his first three after being appointed on a permanent basis in late 2012.

That early bounce has dissipated, first incrementally, then inexorably. In the last 12 months he is averaging only 30.8 in Test cricket, against a career average of 46.5. In his last 10 Tests - all against Australia - that average drops still further, to a fraction over 26.

He has endured dips in form before, most noticeably in the summer of 2010, when four home Tests against Pakistan and two against Bangladesh brought an average of just 22.6.

That presaged an Ashes series when he famously scored 766 runs at 127, the technical flaws eliminated by his old mentor Graham Gooch.

How's stat?! Alastair Cook has not scored a century in his last 20 Test innings, stretching back to May 2013.

But Gooch is now gone, the loyal adviser and the last man lost to spring's bitter purges - with Cook playing a key role in his departure.

And if the weight of captaincy has dogged other stellar batsmen before - Michael Vaughan averaged 36.02 as skipper, compared to 50.98 as carefree foot soldier - others have thrived unhindered... predecessor Strauss averaged 40.76 as England captain and 41.04 alone.

""There will be more pressure on the England side, knowing that any failure, any disappointment, any disaster, will certainly be jumped on by a lot of people,"" said Vaughan.

""When Cook took over the job, everything was in place. He said recently that he inherited Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss's team. This is his opportunity to build his own style, his own brand.""

Backed unequivocally by England's new management structure of Paul Downton and chairman of selectors James Whitaker, Cook now has that rare opportunity in Test cricket: a fresh start.

With Pietersen gone and different faces on the way, it could liberate him to create a team and culture in the image that he chooses, much as Stuart Lancaster used the fallout from the rugby World Cup of 2011 to build a new England rugby team.

A summer of seven Tests at home, in familiar conditions and with warm support, should offer a benign environment.

But time is short and, as the recent one-day series against Sri Lanka has shown, the respite limited. Cook's determination has never been in doubt. Now, with the resolve, must come recovery.

Worcestershire paceman Chris Russell took three wickets from the final four balls to help his side stay top of the North Group with an eight-run win.

Winless Derbyshire looked capable of overhauling the visitors' 177-5, built by skipper Daryl Mitchell's 68 and Colin Munro's 65 from 37 balls.

Wayne Madsen hit 65 from 40 balls and put on 75 with Marcus North (38).

But with 15 needed off the last over, Russell (4-40) removed North, Scott Elstone and Tony Palladino.

After starting the T20 Blast with successive defeats, Worcestershire's fifth straight victory keeps them level on 10 points from seven games with Lancashire, staying top on faster run rate.

But Worcestershire and Lancashire have both played two more matches than every side in the North Group other than bottom side Derbyshire, who have just one point from their first six games.

248,"England took control of the first Test against Sri Lanka on a day when Joe Root and Chris Jordan showed they can be central figures in the side for years to come.

Root's magnificent double hundred was the cornerstone of a tremendous batting display in which England played positively and aggressively to post 575-9 - their highest total against the Sri Lankans.

Root, 23, has such determination and patience. He may look angelic, with his slight build and lovely smile, but he is a gritty so-and-so who relishes the cut and thrust of Test cricket.

To come back from being dropped in Australia, when his game was in pieces, shows great character and I am full of admiration for his effort.

Test Match Special analysis ""Root knows his method. He has clearly done his homework on his opposition bowlers. That's what cricket is about - knowing where you're going to score your runs. Root has done that nicely. He played with control; he wasn't expansive. He has options on the off and leg side and he is a very determined young cricketer.""

Root's tireless knock allowed the lower order to come in and score freely, with Stuart Broad and Liam Plunkett both making hay in the face of some rather curious bodyline tactics from the tourists.

Broad was a delight to watch. When he's playing fluently and aggressively he is very hard to bowl at. He is actually quite a classical player and he thrives when he goes out there and plays some shots.

Jordan, meanwhile, delivered England's highlight with the ball when he struck with his third delivery in Test cricket.

As he has shown in the one-day and Twenty20 sides, Jordan is a player who makes things happen and gets people out. Like Steven Finn, he has a bit of a golden arm and could go on to become a real strike bowler in this England Test team.

In order to get him to the next level, however, I think England's coaches will need to work with him a bit in the autumn.

I spoke to Michael Holding and we both think his run up can be even quicker, with an even greater acceleration so he hits the crease hard. He is a bit leggy and laboured, but I think if they could smooth him out he could bowl even faster.

Jordan claimed the only Sri Lankan wicket to fall as England were let down by some indecision between Jordan and Gary Ballance in their new-look slip cordon and the ambiguities thrown up by television replays of low catches.

Matt Prior's catch was deemed not to have carried by third umpire Steve Davis

To the naked eye, Kaushal Silva looked out caught behind when he feathered Stuart Broad through to Matt Prior.

But with each slow-motion replay, the evidence became more and more inconclusive and inevitably doubts started to creep into the mind of the third umpire.

We see this situation so often with low catches. Perhaps the solution is to give the third umpire a maximum of two replays from which to make a decision.

If their first instinct was to give the player out and they can't see a clear reason to change their mind after two replays, they should stick with their initial verdict and move on with the game.

As things stand, England remain in a commanding position with Sri Lanka still requiring a further 236 runs to avoid the follow-on.

However, with next to nothing in the pitch for the seamers, part-time spinner Moeen Ali will have to show that he can hold down an end and maybe even chip in with the odd wicket.

Should Sri Lanka get on top of Moeen, England's fast bowlers will have to show great skill and patience to force a victory on this wicket.

LV= County Championship Division One, Trent Bridge Nottinghamshire 392 & 387-4 beat Middlesex 505 & 271-9 by six wickets Notts 22pts, Middlesex 8pts Match scorecard

Alex Hales scored 94 to set up Nottinghamshire's six-wicket final-day run-chase victory over Middlesex to go top of the County Championship.

Paul Stirling (66 not out) helped the visitors add 51 runs to declare on 271-9, with Harry Gurney (4-76) taking three of the four wickets to fall.

The hosts were set 385 in 86 overs and Hales and Phil Jacques (76) put on 156.

Nervous nineties This is the second time that Alex Hales has been dismissed in the 90s twice in the same Championship match. He made 98 and 93 against Lancashire at Trent Bridge in August 2010.

Michael Lumb added 68, before Riki Wessels (74 not out) and James Taylor (56 not out) saw Notts to victory.

It was Nottinghamshire's highest successful run chase at Trent Bridge since 1926, when they scored 419-6 to beat Leicestershire.

Notts move five points clear of second-placed Somerset, who have a game in hand and a further five clear of Yorkshire, who are fourth and currently in the middle of a Championship game with Sussex.

Middlesex looked for quick runs in the morning but soon lost John Simpson to Gurney for 49.

Toby Roland-Jones (16) mistimed a hook and skied one to Read off Luke Fletcher and a fuller ball from Gurney accounted for Tim Murtagh for a second-ball duck.

A Gurney yorker then saw off Steven Finn and Middlesex declared, leading by 384 runs.

Hales and Jacques eased Notts to 108-0 from 18 overs at lunch, but Ravi Patel got rid of both dangermen in the afternoon session.

Jacques hit 13 fours before being caught by Roland-Jones, while Hales - who was out for 96 in the first innings - was trapped leg before on the front foot six short of a century, after hitting one six and 10 fours.

Lumb, who by then had reached his first half-century of the season, was joined by Taylor and Notts reached tea on 234-2, needing 151 from 37 overs.

But Lumb flashed at a wide delivery from Steven Finn (1-79) and was caught behind by a diving Simpson, and Samit Patel drove Ravi Patel to short cover in the next over.

Taylor and Wessels shared an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 103 to see Notts to their victory target, with the latter hooking Eoin Morgan for six to seal Nottinghamshire's third win of the season.

Wessels smashed five sixes and five fours in his 48-ball knock as Notts won with more than 11 overs to spare.

BBC Radio Nottingham's Dave Bracegirdle:

""Sometimes you can only say 'wow' when watching professional sport.

251,"Kumar Sangakkara's first Test century at Lord's underlined his status as a modern batting great.

Two weeks ago, he scored a superb one-day hundred to inspire Sri Lanka to victory over England in the penultimate game of the series, and here he batted in a similarly purposeful and unflappable manner to ensure his team avoided the follow-on in the first Test.

Whatever form of cricket he is playing, he never slogs or swipes. He just has this beautiful way of working the ball around the cricket field and accumulating runs.

Even his pull shot isn't loaded with aggression. Instead, he just swivels round in an effortless way and guides the ball to the boundary.

He has always been a model of discipline and concentration, a very graceful, silky player who is an absolute master of his craft.

Leading Test centurions 51 Sachin Tendulkar (India) 45 Jacques Kallis (South Africa) 41 Ricky Ponting (Australia) 36 Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka) 36 Rahul Dravid (India)

It is perhaps because Sangakkara, 36, is not a flamboyant cricketer that he is rarely spoken of in the same terms as Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar or Ricky Ponting. You won't often see the Sri Lanka left-hander coming down the pitch to smash a spinner over his head, or hooking a fast bowler for six.

But his career average of 58.53 is superior to any of his illustrious peers and by inscribing his name on the Lord's honours board he has achieved a feat that eluded all three of them.

He is also a kind, engaging and intelligent man and I would defy you to find anyone who has a word to say against him.

Test Match Special analysis ""The game is not quite as moribund in terms of a positive result as it was an hour before the close because England have taken two or three wickets. A draw is still favourite, but there is scope for England to get into a position where Sri Lanka have got to bat for maybe a day and a bit.""

Could England have done more to try to prise Sangakkara out? Not really. This pitch is so loaded in the batsman's favour that you really are scratching your head to know what to do.

And in the end it took a short, wide delivery from a part-time spinner to finally end his innings as he gifted Moeen Ali his first Test wicket with an edge to Matt Prior.

At that stage in the day, Sri Lanka had eased past the follow-on mark and people were starting to chunter about the pitch.

But the sudden dismissal opened the door to the Sri Lanka lower order and Chris Jordan and Liam Plunkett earned reward for their tireless efforts with a wicket apiece to leave the tourists seven down and still 160 short of England's first-innings score with two days of the match remaining.

Unquestionably, it will still take a big effort for England to force victory on this track, but people really shouldn't be too critical of Lord's groundsman Mick Hunt.

We are lucky that in modern cricket there are far fewer stalemate draws than there used to be. Once a team scores the best part of 600 runs, the onus really is on them to bowl the other team out or it is going to be a draw.

Kumar Sangakkara is the first player to score three successive Test centuries three times in a career

People talk about making the wickets bigger, or the bats thinner, but that is nonsense. No matter how hard you try to prepare a certain type of pitch, you cannot predict exactly how it will play or what effect the weather will have, and inevitably some will do very little.

There was clearly an effort to produce a bit of a grassy wicket here, but it was never as green as it looked from afar and the pitch soon dried out with the warm weather we had over the first two days.

England's chances of forcing a victory will not be helped by the absence of a frontline spinner from their attack, but do not write off this Test match just yet.

He will continue to play limited-overs cricket for Kent and they have the right to end the loan early should they need him in the Championship.

Riley had picked up 19 wickets from six games at an average of 29 prior to the start of Kent's fixture against Glamorgan on Sunday.

Last month Tredwell said that playing so much limited-overs cricket had affected his form with the red ball.

""Perhaps certain habits from playing one-day cricket tend to creep in sometimes and you have got to iron them out.""

253,"Without Gary Ballance's superb century, England could have been facing defeat in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's.

When Matt Prior fell, the hosts were in serious trouble at 121-6 and the lead only 243.

But Ballance's unbeaten 104 enabled them to close the fourth day with an advantage of 389, and a great platform from which to push for victory on the final day.

These are very early days, he is playing only his second Test, but there is no praise enough for the 24-year-old left-hander.

While Ballance is no David Gower - he's not an aesthetically pleasing batsman - he reminds me of former Australia captain Allan Border, one of the toughest cricketers of his generation.

Allan Border, an Australia legend Allan Border scored 11,174 runs at an average of 50 in 156 Tests for Australia between 1978 and 1994. He captained his country in a then record 93 Tests and is credited with masterminding the 1989 Ashes win that led to Australia's 16-year dominance over England. He also led them to World Cup glory in 1987.

England are trying to fill the void at number three left by Jonathan Trott, and there has been much debate over whether to promote Ian Bell, batting at four in this game, or Joe Root, who scored a double hundred from number five in the first innings.

However, Ballance's knock was a classic number three's innings. I would prefer to see him play that kind of nuggety innings at first wicket down, holding the team together and then accelerating, rather than at number five.

Ballance has a very tight bottom-handed grip that means he is more likely to collect runs on the leg side than play languid cover drives.

Only one of the past 10 Tests at Lord's has been drawn. England have won eight and lost one of those.

But he has great discipline, he is strong and he can hit the ball a long way. He proved that with the six over midwicket to bring up his hundred in the final over.

His approach also showed a great understanding of the match situation as England chased quick runs late on.

Ballance was almost strokeless early in his innings - his first 50 took 130 balls - but he played more and more shots as he went on and rescued a perilous situation for England.

His late surge, alongside Chris Jordan and then Stuart Broad, raised the prospect of England skipper Alastair Cook declaring on the fourth evening and giving his bowlers a chance to make inroads.

Whether England declare overnight or continue batting on Monday, Sri Lanka will need to score at comfortably more than four runs an over.

That means Cook can set pressurised fields and simply tell his bowlers to run in, chase wickets and not worry about conceding runs.

Test Match Special analysis ""Sam Robson has a problem around off stump and unless he shows something different I think his place is in jeopardy already. Footwork and judgement are the key areas and if you are not sure what to leave you are in trouble. Cook, we are still waiting for him to return to form.""

Perversely, England might have had a better chance of winning this Test had they been bowled out on Sunday, leaving Sri Lanka chasing a more realistic target and persuading their batsmen to play more freely than they will now.

England's top-order collapse is a cause for concern, though.

Cook and Sam Robson failed again and, while it is hard to draw conclusions on the basis of one Test, the debutant has shown a flawed technique.

He plays with his bat ahead of his pad and has a tendency to be squared up. If the bowler finds the slightest movement, Robson is asking for trouble.

He may be nervous and he needs time to settle, but some improvements must be made if he is to survive in Test cricket because opposition bowlers will pick up on those technical problems.

Jordan, on the other hand, gave great support to Ballance in making 35, and looks the real deal as an all-rounder. He is a very useful addition and a real find for this England side.

Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""We could get someone in for six weeks now and they could play the rest of the group stages.

""That is something we will have to consider because we have now lost three out of five.""

Notts, who are six points behind leaders Worcestershire and three points off the final qualifying place, have reached the quarter-finals stage for the last four seasons.

Newell continued: ""We want to get in the top four. We are used to qualifying for the quarter-finals and we want to do it again.

""To get through we have to win eight out of 14 I think, so that leaves us with an awful lot to do in the last eight matches.

First Test, day five, Lord's England (575-9 dec & 267-8 dec) drew with Sri Lanka (453 & 201-9) Scorecard

England were denied victory in an incredible finale to the first Test as Sri Lanka's last-wicket pair batted out the final five balls to cling on for a draw at Lord's.

In scenes of barely believable drama, umpire Paul Reiffel gave Nuwan Pradeep out lbw to apparently hand England victory off the penultimate ball.

But Sri Lanka used the decision review system to reveal an inside edge, and when an outside edge off the last ball landed inches short of second slip, the tourists had survived.

The result means the teams will head to the second and final Test at Headingley, starting on Friday, with the series all square.

Test Match Special analysis ""I've loved it and I bet the sparse crowd loved it. I felt Sri Lanka would get out of jail, but it was a great effort from England. They will feel a bit flat, but they gave nothing to feel embarrassed about. The four seamers did a terrific job. They really gave it their best shot.""

The match appeared to be drifting towards a stalemate when Sri Lanka, chasing a notional 390 for victory, were 164-3 at tea.

But an amazing final session, in which six wickets fell for 37 runs in fading light, saw England to the cusp of a victory that would have banished the memories of their disastrous 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia.

James Anderson finished with figures of 4-25 off 19 overs, Broad 3-43 and Chris Jordan 2-34 to complete a hugely encouraging debut.

Anderson swung the match either side of tea with three wickets, including the prize scalps of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, in a devastating spell to reduce Sri Lanka to 170-5 with 31 overs remaining.

Jayawardene was caught behind for 18 in the over before the interval before Sangakkara, with fielders crowded round the bat as captain Alastair Cook went all-out attack, chopped on to his stumps for 61.

Four balls later, Lahiru Thirimanne prodded tentatively at a reverse-swinger and edged to Matt Prior to leave Sri Lanka five wickets down.

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews and Prasanna Jayawardene - batting with a broken finger - appeared to take the sting out of the tourists with a partnership that spanned 20 overs.

The door was forced back open by the irrepressible Jordan, who trapped Jayawardene lbw to leave Sri Lanka six down.

England v Sri Lanka Test series 12-16 June: 1st Test, Lord's, match drawn 20-24 June: 2nd Test, Headingley

England took the second new ball and the mayhem continued. Broad found Nuwan Kulasekara's pads, then Anderson drew an edge from Mathews that flew to slip with 18 balls left.

Sri Lanka's ninth-wicket pair rode out the next two overs, but Broad had Rangana Herath taken down the leg side with the first ball of the last over.

Four deliveries later, as Reiffel's finger went up, England were jumping around in elation, but when DRS revealed a thick inside edge, the joy was all Sri Lanka's.

The drama of the final session contrasted with the first two, during which England managed only three wickets after declaring on their overnight score of 267-8.

Broad's dismissal of Dimuth Karunaratne was England's only reward before lunch, while Jordan removed Kaushal Silva for 57 to end a 98-run stand with Sangakkara for the second wicket.

Mahela Jayawardene's departure on the stroke of tea sparked England's late charge, only for Sri Lanka to deny them at the last.

England were subsequently fined 10% of their match fees by the International Cricket Council for maintaining a slow over-rate, with captain Cook fined 20%.

LV= County Championship Division One, Emirates Durham ICG Close, day three: Durham 338 & 267 v Lancashire 266 & 41-2 Durham 6pts Lancashire 5pts Match scorecard

Durham's Scott Borthwick missed out on a century as they set Lancashire a target of 340 to win on day three of their Championship match.

After resuming on 16 without loss, Durham were reduced to 62-4 before Borthwick (92) and Paul Collingwood (47) steadied the ship.

Tom Smith took figures of 5-42 as Durham were bowled out for 267.

Lancashire lost Paul Horton for a duck early on and then saw Alex Davies (18) depart as they reached 41-2 at stumps.

Fast bowler Chris Rushworth took both wickets, trapping Horton and Davies lbw. Usman Khawaja, who scored 86 in Lancashire's first innings, remains unbeaten on 18.

Reigning Division One champions Durham are still searching for their first Championship win of 2014, having drawn six of their seven matches so far.

The home side were under pressure in the morning session as they reached lunch at 96-4, with Smith dismissing Michael Richardson lbw and Ben Stokes caught and bowled in the same over.

A 99-run partnership for the fifth wicket from Collingwood and Borthwick put Durham back in control and John Hastings, batting at nine, then added a useful 40.

Lancashire require 299 runs on the final day if they are to win their second match of the season.

BBC Newcastle's Martin Emmerson:

""Someone asked me today how many points I think Durham need to avoid relegation. While they have not yet won I don't think this season will boil down to that.

""They have drawn six and only lost one and are in decent nick.

""The weather robbed them of a win last time out against Middlesex, but if things go OK tomorrow they should take their first victory of the campaign against Lancashire - the side who have beaten them more times than any other (14 - along with Sussex).

""Durham won't be counting their eggs, however. Yorkshire pulled off a record run chase here last year so it is doable.

""But Lancashire have not been the best with the bat this season and their 340 for victory looks a tall order after losing both openers in the final 14.1 overs of the day to leave them on 41-2. They require one more run than Yorkshire managed.

""Credit to Scott Borthwick, as well, who made a gutsy 92 for Durham in difficult conditions earlier.""

BBC Radio Lancashire's Scott Read:

""Losing the wicket of Alex Davies in the final over took the shine off the day for Lancashire but they still have a chance of getting a result.

""The Red Rose bowled themselves back into the game this morning, taking four Durham wickets.

Teenager Sam Hain became the youngest Warwickshire player to hit a first-class century as the Bears got right on top against Northants at Wantage Road.

The 18-year-old, on 87 overnight, went on to make 134 as the Bears declared on 602-9 after number nine Barker (102 not out) had also reached three figures.

Sam Hain's career to date 1995 - Born in Hong Kong to English parents, brought up in Queensland, Australia.

Spotted by former Bears captain Michael Powell playing schools cricket in Edinburgh.

2011 - Made debut for Warwickshire Second XI, aged 14.

2012 - Plays for Australia at Under-19 World Cup, aged 16.

March 2013 - Signs two-year deal with Warwickshire.

June 2013 - Batting at number eight, out lbw for 1 on List A debut v Worcestershire.

May 2014 - Scores 42 on County Championship debut v Middlesex.

June 2014 - At 18 years, 11 months, becomes youngest Bears player to make a first-class century - beating a record set by Ian Bell, at the age of 19 years, two months

But there were contributions all the way down the order as Northants were set 290 to avoid an innings defeat.

Chris Woakes took three quick wickets before the visitors closed on 51-3.

Opener James Middlebrook (29 not out) and Matt Spriegel (10 not out) stopped the rot with an unbroken stand of 35 after England all-rounder Woakes had reduced the home side to 16-3.

But Division One's winless bottom side Northants now have a tough fight on their hands if they are to prevent their sixth defeat in seven Championship matches this season.

Although Barker made his first century of the summer - his fourth in first-class cricket - the day still belonged to Hong Kong-born Australia Under-19 international Hain.

In becoming the Bears' youngest-ever centurion, Hain broke a record set by England's Ian Bell 13 years ago.

Resuming on their overnight score of 274-4, Hain lost Tim Ambrose early on, but he was well supported by Rikki Clarke, who made 46 in a stand of 86.

Woakes (49) and Jeetan Patel (34) also weighed in with useful scores as the entire Bears' tail wagged to splendid effect.

BBC Radio Northampton's Chris Egerton:

""A dismal day for Northants who had to toil long and hard in the field as Warwickshire posted their highest-ever score against them.

""The morning was dominated by Sam Hain. Born in Hong Kong and brought up on the Gold Coast, he is a self-described ""fair dinkum Pom"" but he plays with good temperament and no little technique. Many view him as the next England batsman to come through the Edgbaston system after Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott.

""After Hain fell, Northants' fielding became ragged under pressure while a collection of lower order partnerships ensured Keith Barker reached his hundred despite a leg injury.

""It is not impossible to imagine Northants batting out the final day to avoid defeat with seven first innings wickets to defend, especially on a flat pitch, but there is an air of resignation among the members that a sixth defeat in seven looks more likely unless they can summon up some heroics from somewhere.""",Northants v Warwickshire: Hain & Barker hit tons as Bears bloom,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75599000/jpg/_75599598_75583728.jpg,2014-06-17 17:52:37,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/cricket/27878614

Adam Lyth and Jack Leaning ground out half-centuries as Yorkshire made steady progress against Sussex on an attritional second day at Arundel.

Replying to the home side's 316, Lyth (66) put together an opening stand of 56 with Alex Lees.

Lyth's 153-ball knock, his fifth half-century of the season, ended when he was caught hooking Steve Magoffin.

Leaning (75 not out) batted for four hours in posting a career-best score as Yorkshire ended 208-3, 108 runs behind.

At the start of the day, resuming on 300-9, Sussex added a further 16 runs with Jon Lewis scoring 11 of them before he was last out for 61.

The miserly bowling of Magoffin made sure Yorkshire had to show patience throughout, as the 34-year-old Queenslander's 23 overs brought two wickets and cost only 22 runs.

James Vince's double century saw him become the first player to 1,000 runs this season as Hampshire beat Essex by 470 runs with a day to spare.

Vince hit 33 boundaries in his career-best 240, while Will Smith ended 151 not out as Hants declared on 440-3.

The pair put on a record stand for Hampshire against Essex of 387 as they set the visitors a massive 606 to win.

Essex were all out for 135 as the hosts equalled the second-biggest victory by a runs margin in Championship history.

It fell 13 short of the record of 483 runs, set by Surrey against Leicestershire at The Oval in 2002.

But it did beat Hampshire's previous first-class best victory of 361 runs against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1984, while it was Essex's heaviest-ever defeat in terms of runs.

South Africa international Kyle Abbott (3-23) impressed with the ball again and finished with match figures of 8-67.

Smith, whose earlier unbeaten ton was his highest score for Hampshire, took the final wicket to fall when he had Tymal Mills caught by Vince to cap a memorable day for both players.

BBC Essex's Nick Gledhill:

Tom Fell hit his maiden first-class century as Worcestershire piled up the runs to set Leicestershire a testing final-day target at Grace Road.

Steve Rhodes reaches his 50 Worcestershire coach Steve Rhodes celebrated his 50th birthday on day three of the Championship game at Grace Road.

Born in the year Worcestershire celebrated their first County Championship, in 1964, Rhodes went on to enjoy two title wins himself, 25 years later in 1988 and again in 1989.

It is 30 years since the young Yorkshireman first arrived at New Road.

It is 20 years since he made his Test debut, winning the first of his 11 caps, in June 1994.

Is is 10 years since being appointed Worcestershire captain. After retiring to become assistant coach, he stepped up as coach when Tom Moody left in 2005, becoming the re-titled director of cricket a year later.

Backed by another ton from captain Daryl Mitchell (120), Fell made 124 as the visitors declared on 444-8.

Fell shared century stands of 178 with Mitchell and 111 with Alexei Kervezee (57), while Tom Kohler-Cadmore weighed in with his maiden half-century (56).

Set 404 to win, Division Two's bottom club Leicestershire closed on 20-0.

Angus Robson and Greg Smith saw their side through seven overs of seam from Jack Shantry and Charlie Morris, before one maiden over of spin from Saeed Ajmal.

But the hosts, still without a win in seven matches this season, will still have to face the Pakistan Test spinner, the county's top wicket taker, on a final-day pitch - and would need to equal their record score in the fourth innings of a match.

Earlier, Leicestershire seamer Nathan Buck took 5-123, his third five-wicket haul of the season in Championship cricket.

For Worcestershire, Mitchell lost his private race with Hampshire's James Vince to become the first player to post 1,000 runs this season.

But his fourth Championship century of the summer has still put his side back into a winning position - quite a turnaround after being bowled out on the first day for just 237.

BBC Radio Leicester's Richard Rae:

""A tough day at the office for the over-worked Leicestershire seamers, notably Nathan Buck and Charlie Shreck, as the wicket flattened out under the sun, but they did not help themselves with poor catching, especially in the slips.

""Dan Redfern's dropping of Tom Fell off Richard Jones, when the batsman was on just 29 early in the day, was a particularly bad and inevitably expensive miss.

262,"Aggers says England's future looks bright - but the side lacks a frontline spinner

After the miserable Ashes tour in the winter, it was hugely uplifting to see England play with such energy and purpose in the first Test of the summer against Sri Lanka at Lord's.

They piled up a massive first-innings score, bowled with heart and skill on a flat pitch and came within a whisker of pulling off a spectacular victory in Monday's pulsating final session.

One of the most encouraging aspects of England's play was the innovative fields set by captain Alastair Cook on the final day.

Cook was heavily criticised in Australia for being too reactive and lacking imagination, but here he was deploying all manner of weird and wonderful strategies.

Before tea, Kumar Sangakarra looked a dead cert for his second century of the match. But when he came out after the interval, he must have been flabbergasted to see five fielders in a ring on the off side, from slip round to straight mid-off.

Last time I saw a field like that was playing Subbuteo cricket on a table top, but there was method in the madness as Sangakkara promptly chopped on to his stumps.

England captain Alastair Cook set some unusual fields on the final day at Lords

Cook later revealed that the extraordinary field was James Anderson's idea, but the whole episode reflects a sea change in England's mentality and approach.

It shows that the dressing room are now open to ideas, that the team can be flexible and that the captain has the confidence to take a risk in the quest for a breakthrough.

I can never imagine Cook being reckless, but he showed he can think outside the box and do something unusual. That can only bode well for the future.

Later, with England desperate to break the partnership between Angelo Mathews and Prasanna Jayawardene, we saw Chris Jordan bowling with a 'Bodyline' field - lots of close catchers on the leg side.

The approach forced Jayawardene on to the back foot and, soon afterwards, he was trapped lbw in front of middle stump.

On pitches like the one at Lord's, you have to make things happen and it was great to see England being so innovative and proactive right up until the final ball.

The fact that all nine wickets fell to England's seamers on the last day highlights the biggest outstanding issue still facing this side - the absence of a frontline spinner.

Moeen Ali could well develop into a top-rank slow bowler but, at the moment, he is only really good enough to be a support spinner.

On the final day of a Test, you are really looking for a spinner to bowl for much of the day. Even if they are not taking wickets, they are creating pressure, but Cook had no one to turn to.

Alastair Cook as England Test captain Played 22 Won 9 Lost 6 Drawn 7

The real problem for England is the dearth of candidates to replace Graeme Swann, who retired midway through the Ashes.

Do they want to throw a young lad like Kent's Adam Riley in against India later this summer? Could you really bring Lancashire's Simon Kerrigan back after he fell apart on his debut against Australia at The Oval last year?

We all know that Monty Panesar has the credentials, but he is having all sorts of off-field issues at the moment and is clearly not selectable.

England may choose to get by this summer by preparing green-top pitches to suit their seamers, but they do not have much Test cricket between now and the 2015 Ashes, and this problem is not going to go away.

The other big concern is Cook's form with the bat. Following scores of 17 and 28 at Lord's, the skipper has now gone 22 innings without a century and desperately needs a score in the second Test at Headingley, which starts on Friday.

263,"Alastair Cook and the England fielders react after an edge off the final ball falls just short of second slip

England captain Alastair Cook says his team can use their performance in the first Test against Sri Lanka as a springboard for an exciting new era.

The hosts took six wickets after tea in a thrilling final session but were denied a victory by Sri Lanka's final pair, who batted out five balls to salvage a draw at Lord's.

""We made a lot of the running in this Test match,"" said Cook.

""We were ahead throughout and we can take a lot from that.""

In their first Test since the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter, England came agonisingly close to victory on the final day as James Anderson, who claimed 4-25, took two wickets in an over shortly after tea.

It was a great Test match and that's what cricket is all about - to go all the way down to the wire with both sides leaving everything out there Alastair Cook England captain

The match went to the wire as Stuart Broad claimed Sri Lanka's ninth wicket with the first ball of the last over.

""I thought we were just going to get over the line, so it's disappointing not to,"" Cook added. ""But you couldn't ask for anything more.""

Umpire Paul Reiffel gave Nuwan Pradeep out lbw off the penultimate ball, but the tourists were given a reprieve when their review showed a thick inside edge.

Broad found the outside edge with his next delivery but the ball dropped just short of Chris Jordan at second slip.

Asked if he was frustrated or proud, Cook said: ""It's probably a mixture of both. At tea it looked quite a long way away.

""But when you get so close, and then get a decision which 'wins' you a Test match overturned, it's quite hard to take. Then for that last nick not to carry too...

""But it was a great Test match and that's what cricket is all about - to go all the way down to the wire with both sides leaving everything out there.""

Cook was particularly pleased with England's batting display as they racked up more than 500 runs for the first time in three years.

Joe Root, who was dropped for the last Ashes Test in Sydney, scored 200 not out in the first innings, and Gary Ballance an unbeaten 104 at number three in only his second Test to set up England's victory push.

""A lot of the guys can take a lot of credit for the way we batted as a unit,"" said Cook.

""Rooty was outstanding with a double-hundred. It's great to see him back to his best. Gary showed his class at international level. We took that bit of a gamble and it's paid off. He looks a class player.""

Most Test wickets for England 383 Ian Botham (102 Tests) 350 James Anderson (93 Tests) 325 Bob Willis (90 Tests) 307 Fred Trueman (67 Tests) 297 Derek Underwood (86 Tests)

Cook remains concerned by his own form after scores of 17 and 28 extended his run of innings without a century to 22.

""I'd love a score,"" he said. ""Leading from the front as a captain, you want to score runs. The longer it goes on, the harder it gets.""

Root said England proved they could play attacking cricket after Australia coach Darren Lehmann described them as a ""dour"" side last year.

""Twelve months ago we were told we were playing dour cricket. I don't think anyone can say that now,"" he said.

""We spoke long and hard about making big scores, individually and as a team, and that's a great start to the summer.""

England were fined 10% of their match fees by the International Cricket Council for maintaining a slow over-rate, with Cook fined 20%.

Surrey moved up to third place in the Division Two table by completing an emphatic 10-wicket victory over Derbyshire on the final morning.

Set just 21 to win after bowling out the home side for 288 on the third day, they knocked off the runs in 5.5 overs.

Rory Burns picked up the single to take them to 21-0 and secure their second Championship win of the summer.

Surrey's only Championship victory in 2013 was also against Derbyshire, by four wickets at The Oval.

He finished five not out, with opening partner Zafar Ansari, who made a century in the first innings, on 15.

The pair were in no hurry at the start of play as Burns played out a maiden over from Mark Footitt, but Ansari collected a couple of boundaries off the same bowler before they reached the target.

Surrey will take great particular encouragement from the performances of Ansari, who also took five wickets in the game, and teenage seam bowler Tom Curran.

They were in control after 19-year-old Curran took 5-51 as the home side were bowled out for just 153 on the opening day.

For Derbyshire, who were relegated along with Surrey in 2013, their defeat checked any momentum gained by beating Leicestershire last week, and meant they remained next to bottom.

Surrey skipper Gary Wilson told BBC London 94.9:

""We actually got a bit lucky with the toss - it was a good toss to lose. They made the right decision in having a bat first, it was a dry wicket, but the way our bowlers performed on that first morning was outstanding and Tom, especially, was very good.

""Everyone is really pleased for Zafar. It's always special when someone gets that first first-class hundred and he certainly deserved it.

Record Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan will work with Australia as a spin-bowling consultant for their Test series against Pakistan.

The Sri Lankan, who took 800 Test wickets, travels to the United Arab Emirates for October's two-Test series.

""I have bowled to most of the Pakistani batsmen in the past, so hopefully I can help a bit,"" said Muralitharan, 42.

In 2003 he threatened never to return to Australia because of abuse from fans over his controversial bowling action.

Muralitharan, who retired from Test cricket in 2010, was no-balled by umpire Darrell Hair in the 1995 Boxing Day Test in Melbourne and by Ross Emerson during a one-day international in Brisbane the following year.

Although his action was subsequently cleared by the International Cricket Council, Emerson later no-balled Muralitharan in a 1999 ODI against England in Adelaide, enraging Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga who led his team off the field for 15 minutes.

Despite the controversies, Muralitharan has played in the past two Big Bash Twenty20 competitions in Australia.

The world's top-ranked Test side boast a strong pace attack, but have struggled to replace Shane Warne since his retirement from international cricket in 2007.

Off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who has 112 Test wickets at an average of 32.99, is currently Australia's leading slow bowler.

Muralitharan said: ""Nathan Lyon has been bowling brilliantly, but hopefully I can help him a little bit on how to bowl in these subcontinent conditions.""

Despite whitewashing England 5-0 in the latest Ashes series, Australia's batsmen have struggled against quality spin bowling on turning pitches, losing 4-0 in India in 2013.

Muralitharan said he intended to help prepare Michael Clarke's side to face Pakistan's 36-year-old spinner Saeed Ajmal.

""Ajmal is a difficult customer for all the best batsmen in the world but he bowls a little bit similar to me, so perhaps if I can bowl to the Australian batsmen it might help a little bit and give them some tips,"" he said.

267,"Chris Froome became only the second-ever British winner of the Tour de France last year, following Sir Bradley Wiggins's success in 2012

A special exemption allowing Chris Froome to take steroids ahead of the Tour de Romandie followed correct procedure, say doping bosses.

A French newspaper claimed the International Cycling Federation (UCI) failed to refer the request to the relevant committee.

But the World Anti-Doping Agency said it was ""satisfied"" with the process.

What is prednisolone? Prednisolone is a medicine used in inflammatory and allergic disorders. It is a corticosteroid and works by preventing or reducing inflammation. It is used to treat a number of conditions that are characterised by excessive inflammation. Corticosteroid are prohibited when administered by oral, intravenous, intramuscular or rectal routes, but exemption requests may be made. Sources: nhs.uk; wada-ama.org.

Team Sky had asked the UCI to grant a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) after Froome contracted a chest infection.

Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper had asserted that Team Sky's request for Froome to take corticosteroid prednisolone ahead of the race at the end of April was authorised by the UCI medical supervisor without referring the case to the TUE committee.

However, a Wada statement said it was ""satisfied that the UCI's decision to grant a Therapeutic Use Exemption to Chris Froome was conducted according to the rules of the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, and therefore will not be reviewing this case any further"".

The UCI has also looked into the newspaper's claims but said ""nothing out of the ordinary occurred"" in the process to grant an exemption.

In a statement, the sport's governing body said: ""Any rider in the same situation with comparable supporting medical evidence would have been given an authorisation to take similar oral treatment.""

The UCI is reviewing its anti-doping rules and said it was looking at the TUE process with Wada.

Mark Cavendish timed his sprint to perfection to win the fourth stage of the Tour of Switzerland.

The 29-year-old completed the 160.4km leg from Heiden to Ossingen in three hours 35 minutes three seconds.

Fellow Briton Sir Bradley Wiggins crashed in the closing stages and finished almost 12 minutes behind.

Cavendish's Omega Pharma - Quick-Step team-mate Tony Martin retained his six-second overall lead from Tom Dumoulin, with Wiggins almost 14 minutes adrift.

Team Sky sports director Dan Frost said of Wiggins: ""He sustained grazing and bruising to the muscles on his right leg, which will be treated overnight and the team doctor will be reviewing his injury in the morning.

""Bradley has been carrying a mild chest infection from the weekend so he has been taking antibiotics and his condition has improved. Racing with this illness has affected him a bit, but he's shown his commitment and has worked really well for the team.""

Britain's Sir Bradley Wiggins has withdrawn from the Tour of Switzerland through injury, less than three weeks before the start of the Tour de France.

Wiggins, 34, injured his right thigh in a crash on Tuesday's fourth stage.

""We felt the best plan of action would be to withdraw him,"" said Team Sky doctor Steve Baynes.

A day after Wiggins's crash, fellow Briton Mark Cavendish pitched over his handlebars in a crash near the end of stage five, which Sacha Modolo won.

Omega Pharma-QuickStep's Cavendish, who won stage four, fell heavily after tangling with Matt Goss - of Orica Green Edge - just 300m from the finish.

The Tour de France, won by Wiggins in 2012, starts in Yorkshire on 5 July.

Wiggins's participation was already in serious doubt after he told the BBC he would not be competing ""as things stand"".

The four-time Olympic gold medallist was absent as Chris Froome won the race last year, and claimed Team Sky's focus was again on his fellow Briton.

Wiggins was left with bruising and swelling to his right thigh after crashing 28km from the end of Tuesday's stage.

He will now switch his focus to the National Road Championships in Monmouthshire on 26 June.

""I was the last man in the peloton, trying to stay out of trouble, when it happened,"" said Wiggins.

270,"Michael McKillop celebrates after winning his T37 1500m at the London Paralympics

London 2012 Paralympics hero Michael McKillop says he is on course for the IPC European Athletics Championships despite an injury-affected nine months.

A foot injury had kept the Northern Irish middle distance runner out of action until two weeks ago but he expects to compete in Wales.

""I think I've enough time to be ready for mid-August,"" said McKillop, who has a mild form of cerebral palsy.

""Swansea is like another home games so I really want to be there.""

McKillop's injury problems arose as he attempted to resume training following his summer break after winning two gold medals at last year's IPC World Championships in Lyon.

""After about three or four days of running I got severe foot pain in the left side and I went to the physio at the Sports Institute of Northern Ireland.

""They had a look at it and thought I would be out for a couple of weeks. But they didn't really know where the pain was coming from and recovery ended up taking a lot longer.""

Eventually, McKillop was sent to see a foot specialist in London and after the injury was finally diagnosed, a month in a compression boot was followed by over six more months of rehab spent almost exclusively at the Sports Institute near Belfast.

""I was pretty much living in the Sports Institute from September until about a month ago. In every day, getting treatment, going into the gym, strengthening my foot and working on my upper body because I couldn't run.

""I was aqua jogging and, while that and cross-training has helped me get back running, I need to get track fit and that will take a couple of weeks.""

McKillop acknowledges that he found it difficult to come to terms with his first real protracted period of injury in a relatively short athletics career.

""I had never been out for more than a month. It got depressing and I was not in a good place at times but I pulled through after a lot of support from friends and family.""

The Glengormley man says that his involvement in visiting schools as an athlete mentor as part of the Sky Sports Living for Sport programme also helped keep his spirits up during his injury spell.

Probably, my first races will be mid-July and I'll race myself fit in a way Michael McKillop on his build-up to Swansea championships

""They see me as an inspiration for kids so I've been asked to go around schools and tell my story and try and teach them a few sporting values.

""Hopefully I have inspired a few kids to maybe look at sport as a means of changing their own lives and also maybe looking at Paralympic sport as well.

""And during the period of injury, it got me into a routine, been able to go into schools and meet a lot of young kids who have so much potential in sport and art and education. I learn stuff from the kids every single time I go into the schools.""

However, McKillop's main focus now is getting himself right for the Swansea championships which take place on 18-23 August.

""I've got a month or so on the track to try to get fit enough and sharp enough and then start really hard sessions.

""Hopefully after a couple of sessions, I'll be back doing a couple of British Milers Club or Irish Milers Club races. Probably, my first races will be mid-July and I'll race myself fit in a way.

271,"Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Brazil

BRAZIL (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: The flicks and tricks remain second nature, but this Brazil side is also resilient and well organised, moulded by the pragmatism of 2002 World Cup winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.

They press the opposition high up the pitch, while midfielder Luiz Gustavo acts as an auxiliary third centre-back - allowing the full-backs and the likes of centre-back David Luiz to venture forward.

Brazil usually adopt a 4-2-3-1 formation and are not afraid to be direct, often seeking out the flamboyant Neymar on the left with long balls from the back.

Strengths: Take your pick. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has the required major tournament know-how, the players are talented and well-drilled, the strong team spirit is abundantly evident and a passionate home crowd will surely inspire the team again, as they did at the Confederations Cup last summer.

Weaknesses: The paucity of centre forward options is a potential concern. First-choice Fred has been injured for five months this season, Jo's form has faltered, and Diego Costa opted to represent Spain.

First-team regulars Neymar, Paulinho and Oscar have also had a critical press over their club performances.

Key player

Believe the hype; Neymar is pivotal to Brazil. Full of energy and deft touches, and able to dribble at incredible speed, he is the player most capable of changing a game for Luiz Felipe Scolari's side.

The 22-year-old World Cup poster boy must put aside a difficult second half of the season with Barcelona after the club were investigated for tax fraud over his transfer last summer.

Neymar has been in prolific form for Brazil

One to watch

Strong in the air and composed in possession, captain Thiago Silva was the only defender shortlisted for the 2013 Fifa Ballon d'Or.

He is worthy of a place in the great 1970 Brazil side in the opinion of World Cup winner Rivelino.

The boss

Reappointed in November 2012, World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has recovered from a poor start to his second spell in charge to shape Brazil into a side he is ""100% sure… will be the champion"" this summer.

The 65-year-old led Portugal to the Euro 2004 final, 2006 World Cup semi-finals and last eight at Euro 2008 between his spells as Brazil boss.

The key to this transformation, according to defender Dante, is Scolari's paternal approach.

How they qualified

As hosts.

CROATIA

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Croatia

Prospects

Croatia lack the depth of talent associated with the golden generation of the late 1990s but they have enough quality to challenge for a place in the knockout stage.

Few nations can boast a midfield pairing with the class of Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic, while Bayern Munich forward Mario Mandzukic scored an unrivalled 18 goals from open play in the Bundesliga this season.

A ponderous defence, absence of a top-class holding midfielder and limited options in wide positions are all cause for concern.

Key player

Luka Modric excelled for Real Madrid this season in a deep-lying midfield role, which is the position from which he now dictates the tempo for his country.

The slightly-built playmaker's passing accuracy of 89.73% was the highest by a non-Barcelona player in La Liga.

The 28-year-old may no longer be instantly recognisable, however, having had his long, flowing hair cut off the day after winning the Champions League.

One to watch

Ivan Rakitic, 26, has been one of the top performers in Europe this season and captained Sevilla to victory in the Europa League final with a typically classy and all-action display.

The former Switzerland Under-21 international scored a career-best 15 goals in 2013-14. Popular Spanish sport newspaper Marca has described the 26-year-old as a todocampista, a player capable of playing anywhere in midfield.

The boss

Former Croatia captain Niko Kovac was appointed head coach in October after Igor Stimac resigned.

He guided his country though a two-legged play-off against Iceland and will be heading to his third World Cup, having played in 2002 and 2006.

Born in Berlin, he has spoken of Croatia's players needing to adopt German virtues of thoroughness and discipline.

How they qualified

Croatia earned 16 points from their first six fixtures but then lost three games for the first time in a qualifying campaign: twice against Scotland and at home to Belgium.

Given a second chance to qualify via the play-offs, Croatia beat Iceland 2-0 on aggregate.

World Cup record

Croatia memorably finished third on their World Cup debut in 1998 but they failed to progress from the group stage in 2002 and 2006.

MEXICO

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Mexico

Prospects

Mexico are hurriedly trying to regroup after their worst ever World Cup qualifying campaign in which they used 47 players and four coaches.

The latter of those, Miguel Herrera, has relied heavily on domestic players and implemented an attack-minded 5-3-2 formation.

It's anyone's guess as to whether Mexico can rediscover the form of 2012, when they won 10 of 12 internationals plus Olympic gold.

Key player

The current Player of the Year for North and Central America and the Caribbean, Oribe Peralta, top scored with 10 goals in the qualifying campaign - half of them coming in the play-off against New Zealand.

The 30-year-old has seized his second chance since being recalled after a six-year absence in 2011. An unerring finisher, Peralta's 22 goals for Santos Laguna this season have earned him a move to Mexican giants America.

One to watch

Dynamic box-to-box midfielder Hector Herrera made headlines last summer when his transfer to Porto became the first major deal negotiated by Nicky Blair, the football agent son of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Herrera impressed with his energy and incisive passing as part of Mexico's Olympic gold medal-winning side in 2012. An injury to Juan Carlos Medina means he may be asked to sit deep.

The boss

Overlooked for the 1994 World Cup squad as a player, Miguel Herrera led Mexico to Brazil after being named as the nation's fourth coach in six weeks prior to the qualification play-off against New Zealand.

The squat, straight-talking 46-year-old got the job after winning a first Mexican league title

How they qualified

Mexico looked destined to miss out on the World Cup until the USA scored two stoppage-time goals to beat Panama, thus preventing them from finishing fourth and taking the play-off spot.

Mexico seized their lifeline, beating New Zealand 9-3 on aggregate to qualify.

World Cup record

This will be their 15th appearance - a tally bettered only by Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy.

Quarter-finalists on home soil in 1970 and 1986, they have bowed out at the last-16 stage in the last five tournaments.

Squad

Goalkeepers: Jose de Jesus Corona (Cruz Azul), Guillermo Ochoa (Ajaccio), Alfredo Talavera (Toluca).

CAMEROON

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Cameroon

Prospects

It is a long time since the Indomitable Lions were the pride of African football.

They lost all three of their games at the 2010 World Cup and have since failed to qualify for the last two Africa Cup of Nations.

Underpinning this mediocrity is ongoing player friction and discontent with the running of Cameroon's football federation, which was briefly suspended by Fifa last July because of government interference.

An all-too-familiar dispute over bonuses has preceded this summer's World Cup, but few observers expect a squad top heavy with defensive-minded players to earn any performance-related pay

Key player

Samuel Eto'o is the captain and record goalscorer but he continues to be a divisive figure. He briefly retired from international duty last September in the wake of a dispute with coach Volker Finke, and and in the latest fallout with team-mates he then claimed there was a ""plot"" among them not to pass him the ball in the World Cup play-off against Tunisia.

Eto'o served a seven-match ban in 2011 for leading a players' boycott in a row over unpaid match fees. The Cameroon prime minister once had to persuade him to play in 2012.

Samuel Eto'o is playing in his fourth World Cup after 1998, 2002 and 2010

One to watch

Central defender Nicolas NKoulou is coveted by many of Europe's big clubs and financially-troubled Marseille are expected to sell him this summer, despite rejecting a €12m bid from Napoli in December.

The 24-year-old started all three of Cameroon's matches at the last World Cup and was voted in the French top flight's team of the year in 2012 and 2013.

The boss

A revolutionary of the German game in the 1990s with unfashionable Freiburg, fluent French speaker Volker Finke was appointed Cameroon's head coach midway through the qualifying campaign.

The 66-year-old former school teacher is a self-confessed student of African football.

How they qualified

They received a World Cup lifeline in June 2013 when Fifa awarded them a 3-0 win over Togo, who had fielded a suspended player. Cameroon had lost the match 2-0 but the ruling put them top of their group. They then beat Tunisia 4-1 in their play-off.

World Cup record

Brazil will be their seventh World Cup - an African record - but Cameroon have only won one match in four editions since reaching the quarter-finals in 1990.

The nadir came in 2010 when they lost all three group matches for the first time.

Fifa ranking: 56

Squad

Goalkeepers: Loic Feudjou (Coton Sport), Charles Itandje (Konyaspor), Sammy Ndjock (Fethiyespor).

Defenders: Benoit Assou-Ekotto (QPR, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Henri Bedimo (Lyon), Aurelien Chedjou (Galatasaray), Cedric Djeugou (Coton Sport), Nicolas Nkoulou (Marseille), Dany Nounkeu (Besiktas), Allan Nyom (Granada).

Midfielders: Enoh Eyong (Antalyaspor), Jean Makoun (Rennes), Joel Matip (Schalke), Stephane Mbia (Sevilla, on loan from QPR), Benjamin Moukandjo (Nancy), Landry Nguemo (Bordeaux), Edgar Salli (Lens), Alex Song (Barcelona).

272,"Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Argentina

ARGENTINA (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: Argentina often fielded a bold 4-3-3 formation in qualifying, although a more conservative 5-3-2 was deployed for tricky away fixtures. The former system allows Lionel Messi to find space between the lines while Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain stretch play.

But with Angel Di Maria deployed as part of a midfield three, the formation offers little defensive protection. Coach Alejandro Sabella admits ""we are not a team who attack based on possession or order - we are an anarchic team, with very anarchic players.""

Strengths: Incomparable firepower. Between them, Argentina's five strikers have 124 goals this season - all for top clubs. Their front three are supported by Angel Di Maria, forming ""Los Cuatro Fantasticos"" - the Fantastic Four. On paper, no other side in Brazil can rival that attacking talent. And with all three group games in Brazil's south, they'll get plenty of away support, plus easy travel and cool weather.

Weaknesses: The same, fundamental flaw that ended their 2010 campaign - the team lacks balance, as coach Alejandro Sabella openly admits. Against elite opposition they can't rely on Javier Mascherano to be their only midfield tackler, yet they don't have another ball-winner in his class.

Keeper Sergio Romero made just three league appearances for Monaco this season and could be a weak link. Lionel Messi's recent club form is also a legitimate concern - despite scoring 41 times for Barcelona in 2013-14.

Key player

Often accused of failing to reproduce his Barcelona form at international level, Lionel Messi had gone 16 competitive matches without scoring prior to the appointment of Alejandro Sabella in 2011. However, the coach's decision to hand Messi, 26, the captaincy has proved inspired - he scored 10 times in 14 World Cup qualifiers.

One to watch

Messi's role is pivotal, but Angel Di Maria defines the team shape. He's a winger shoe-horned into a midfield three as a playmaker but has the stamina and discipline to make it work. Also used deeper by Real Madrid at times this season, he recorded 17 La Liga assists - the highest figure in the top five European leagues.

The boss

Alejandro Sabella earned his chance after guiding Estudiantes to victory in the Copa Libertadores in 2009. Prior to that he had spent nearly 20 years as assistant to Daniel Passarella. He was part of Argentina's backroom team at the 1998 World Cup.

How they qualified

Easily. They were the only side to win in Colombia, beat Chile twice, and impressed in home victories against Uruguay (3-0) and Ecuador (4-0). A first ever defeat by Venezuela, home draw with Bolivia and meaningless final-game loss to Uruguay were rare blips.

World Cup record

They have twice won the tournament (1978 and 1986) and have finished runners-up on two other occasions. But they have not reached the semi-finals since 1990.

Fifa ranking: 5

BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA

Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Bosnia-Hercegovina

Prospects

Despite being the only World Cup debutants, Bosnia are odds-on with most bookies to reach the last 16 thanks to their attacking firepower and technical ability.

Their cavalier tactics in qualifying - a 4-4-2 diamond - yielded 30 goals, 18 from strike duo Edin Dzeko and Vedad Ibisevic.

While the squad is overflowing with playmakers, it lacks effective ball-winners to screen the defence. Expect them to change formation against Argentina but go for the jugular against Nigeria and Iran.

Edin Dzeko ended the season in fine form for Premier League champions Manchester City

Key player

One of the best players in Serie A this season, Roma's Miralem Pjanic turned down Luxembourg and France to represent the country he left just before war broke out. He's a technically gifted dead-ball specialist capable of spectacular goals, but with veteran Zvjezdan Misimovic in favour as Bosnia's 'number 10', Pjanic operates from deep or out wide.

The boss

Voted the best player in Paris St-Germain's history, Safet Susic represented Yugoslavia at the 1982 and 1990 World Cups. He says of his cavalier approach: ""We know that we expose ourselves too much and that there is a huge risk in the way we play - but that is the price we are willing to pay. In the end, we play to score more goals than the opposition, and it has paid off so far.""

How they qualified

Beaten in the play-offs by Portugal in their previous two qualifying campaigns, the Bosnians were determined to top their group this time round. They edged out Greece on goal difference following a final-game win in Lithuania.

World Cup record

They will be the only debutants at the 2014 World Cup.

Fifa ranking: 21

Squad

Goalkeepers: Asmir Begovic (Stoke City), Asmir Avdukic (Borac Banja Luka), Jasmin Fejzic (VFR Aalen).

Strikers: Vedad Ibisevic (VfB Stuttgart), Edin Dzeko (Manchester City), Edin Visca (Istanbul BB).

IRAN

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Iran

Prospects

Iran are Asia's highest ranked team but are the outsiders in Group F, although few will relish facing them. They were dour and defensive in qualifying, with 10 clean sheets - the most of any side in Brazil. But their build-up is often slow and predictable and they were desperately short of cutting edge in recent friendlies against Belarus and Montenegro (both 0-0) and Angola (1-1). A bizarre squabble over badly fitting training kit does not bode well either.

Key player

Midfielder Javad Nekounam, 33, is captain and talisman, but the new golden boy is Reza Ghoochannejhad - Charlton's Iran-born, Dutch-raised forward.

The 26-year-old made his international debut last year and scored six goals in as many games in 2013.

The boss

Carlos Queiroz has been outspoken in his criticism of Iran's Football Federation, which he described as ""lethargic, lacking ambition"" when he took over in 2011. Despite resistance from conservative elements, he has called up several players who grew up outside of Iran, including USA-born Steven Beitashour. Portugal's coach in 2010, he has praised the passion of Iranian fans but admits he doesn't have a ""magic wand"" to solve the side's flaws. He will leave his post after Brazil.

How they qualified

Having made serene progress in the early stages, Iran's qualifying hopes were in jeopardy after managing just two goals and two wins in their opening five matches of the final group stage. But they ended the campaign with three successive victories, latterly beating South Korea away to top the group.

World Cup record

Iran have failed to progress from the group stage in their three appearances (1978, 1998, 2006), with their only win coming against the USA in 1998.

NIGERIA

Prospects

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Nigeria

After failing to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, the Super Eagles have undergone a radical transformation under Steven Keshi, who has sought to lower the average age of the squad. His selection policy, at times controversial, has paid off - last year the Super Eagles won their first African title since 1994. They produced a competent showing at the Confederations Cup, but improvement is needed to reach the knockout stages in 2014.

Key player

Victor Moses has quickly become an integral figure since making his debut in 2012. He provided real cutting edge at this year's Africa Cup of Nations and was sorely missed at the Confederations Cup, for which he was injured.

The boss

Sacked as Togo coach a few months before the 2006 World Cup and likewise as Nigeria assistant in 2002, Stephen Keshi richly deserves the chance to finally test his managerial mettle on the grandest stage of all. He is considered a father figure by many players, but has had to fend off repeated criticism over his controversial focus on selecting youngsters ahead of bigger names. His contract expires after Brazil.

How they qualified

Easily. One of two unbeaten African sides (along with Ivory Coast), they ended five points clear in their group, then beat Ethiopia 4-1 in a play-off. They scored 11 goals - fewer than any other side who booked their place in Brazil.

World Cup record

The Super Eagles reached the last 16 in 1994 and 1998 but fell at the first hurdle in their two subsequent tournament appearances (2002 and 2010).

BELGIUM (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: Belgium's powerful side try to dominate possession and their opposition, pinning them deep inside their own half. Full-backs offer width; wide players stretch play further while a staggered central midfield trio allow for intricate passing

Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini and Manchester City's Vincent Kompany are two of 12 Premier League players in the Belgium squad

A feature of their usual 4-3-3 system is the frequent positional interchanging between their attacking players.

Strengths: Their, er, strength for one thing; Belgium are a physically imposing side and seldom outmuscled.

They also have an abundance of versatile attacking players and, crucially, a tight-knit team spirit instilled by coach Marc Wilmots.

Weaknesses: Despite all their possession, Belgium can have trouble breaking the opposition down. Wilmots's men play a high line trying to squeeze the pitch leaving them susceptible to the counter-attack. While the wide players like to drift infield and do not routinely help out with defensive duties - which can leave the full-backs exposed.

Key player

Chelsea's Eden Hazard, 23 is vital to Belgium's hopes. Given licence to roam, Hazard plays across the final attacking third trying to open up the opposition with his intricate play. His clever runs can leave space for the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Kevin Mirallas and Dries Mertens.

One to watch

The unsung hero of this talented Belgian side is defensive midfielder Axel Witsel. The 25-year-old was an ever-present in qualifying and led the team in passes made. His shielding work gives the rest of the team faith to attack.

The boss

A celebrated player, and then a less successful politician, Marc Wilmots became national coach in June 2012 after three years as an assistant. His managerial CV was restricted to undistinguished spells at Schalke and Belgian side St Truiden, but he did guide Belgium from 54th to a best-ever fifth in the Fifa rankings.

How they qualified

In emphatic fashion, registering a national record seven successive qualifying wins during an unbeaten campaign.

World Cup record

Belgium qualified for six straight World Cups from 1982 to 2002, reaching the knockout phase five times and coming fourth in 1986.

Fifa ranking: 11

Squad

Possible starting XI

Goalkeepers: Thibaut Courtois (Atletico Madrid, on loan from Chelsea), Simon Mignolet (Liverpool), Sammy Bossut (Zulte Waregem).

Defenders: Toby Alderweireld (Atletico Madrid), Laurent Ciman (Standard Liege), Nicolas Lombaerts (Zenit St Petersburg), Vincent Kompany (Manchester City), Daniel Van Buyten (Bayern Munich), Anthony Vanden Borre (Anderlecht), Thomas Vermaelen (Arsenal), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham).

Midfielders: Nacer Chadli, Mousa Dembele (both Tottenham), Steven Defour (Porto), Kevin De Bruyne (Wolfsburg), Marouane Fellaini, Adnan Januzaj (both Manchester United), Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Kevin Mirallas (Everton), Divock Origi (Lille), Axel Witsel (Zenit St Petersburg).

Forwards: Romelu Lukaku (Everton, on loan from Chelsea), Dries Mertens (Napoli).

ALGERIA

Prospects

Write off Algeria at your peril. No longer World Cup whipping boys, the Desert Foxes are boosted by a stronger professional league, improving standards at grassroots level and an influx of emigre players, those with Algerian parents or ancestry.

Zinedine Zidane, Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri have all previously slipped through Algeria's net. The Greens will be hoping they have turned off that particular tap that has been flowing in France's direction for many a year, and with it enhanced their own standing in world football.

World Cup stars of yesteryear Diego Maradona and Rivaldo, as well as Javier Zanetti, have been queuing up to sing the virtues of the Greens' class of 2014 - the only Arab nation present in Brazil. Maradona predicts Algeria ""will cause a surprise"", while Rivaldo says ""the possibilities of reaching the second round are abundant"".

Key player

France-born Sofiane Feghouli, 24, is an attacking midfielder or winger for Valencia who was described by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a year ago as ""exceptional"" and ""a physical beast"". He was named in a preliminary French senior squad for a friendly with Uruguay in 2008, aged 18.

One to watch

Retiring skipper Madjid Bougherra, formerly of Rangers, brings his decade-long international career to an end after the World Cup. He pre-dates any of his team-mates in Brazil by over two years, providing dogged defensive determination to Algeria's backline, as England found out in their goalless draw at the World Cup four years ago.

The boss

Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic, 61, took charge in July 2011 and the disciplinarian has cast aside several established players in favour of a new generation, many of whom represented France at youth level. Brazil will be his World Cup bow as a coach, having been sacked by Ivory Coast three months before the 2010 finals.

How they qualified

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Algeria

Algeria were the last African qualifiers, beating Cup of Nations finalists Burkina Faso 1-0 in the second leg of their play-off to advance on away goals after a 3-2 first-leg defeat. They won all but one game in the previous group stage.

World Cup record

In 1982, Algeria became the first African nation to win two matches in the same finals, but they failed to qualify from the group on goal difference after Germany and Austria contrived a result that allowed them both to progress.

Algeria have not won a game in their subsequent two finals (1986 and 2010).

RUSSIA

Prospects

Fabio Capello and Russia work to each other's strengths: they are desperate to be a presence on the global and European stage; he is eager to show the footballing world he is more than just a club boss.

Their miserly back-line predominantly come from CSKA Moscow, while perennial Champions League dark horses Zenit St. Petersburg provide the rest of the spine.

For the most part, Capello only calls up Russian-based players so he has got to know his squad and their strengths quickly. The midfield is key of them, playing high-tempo, pressing football. Yet their Achilles heel can be when they are subjected to it themselves.

Key player

Exciting attacking prospect Alexander Kokorin is the torch-bearer of youth in Capello's ageing side. The Italian will make room for the 23-year-old, be it on the left, behind a striker, or even as the main front man. A growing influence, Kokorin scored four goals in eight starts during qualifying and hit double figures for the second successive season in the Russian top-flight.

Fabio Capello will face Algeria for a second World Cup in a row, after steering England through a dire 0-0 draw in 2010.

One to watch

Russia's ageing back-line is headed by Sergei Ignashevich, one of four CSKA Moscow team-mates that could feasibly start either in goal or defence as they try to take their miserly defensive record to the world stage. The 34-year-old stalwart needs protecting from pace these days and could wilt in the Brazilian sun. He will certainly be in the party mood however if he manages to win his 100th cap at a World Cup.

The boss

Former England boss Fabio Capello inherited a side that had been meekly eliminated from Euro 2012. He quickly instilled a greater mental fortitude into the team and dropped fading force Andrey Arshavin. The Italian's authoritarian style divided opinion in England, but has earned approval in Russia - he has been given an extended contract until 2018.

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Russia

How they qualified

Despite back-to-back defeats by Portugal and Northern Ireland, they edged the former to win Group F by a point. They conceded just five times in 10 games.

World Cup record

Russia has competed at two World Cups since it became independent from the USSR in 1991, failing to progress beyond the group stage in either tournament.

Despite a perceived fearsome reputation the USSR flattered to deceive on the world stage and, akin to England, enjoyed their best tournament in 1966 when they finished fourth.

Forwards: Maxim Kanunnikov (Amkar Perm), Alexander Kerzhakov (Zenit St Petersburg), Alexander Kokorin (Dynamo Moscow).

SOUTH KOREA

Prospects

When South Korea and Japan were awarded the 2002 World Cup as co-hosts it was with a view to spreading the football gospel. To provide better coaching, facilities and infrastructure not only for both countries but for Asian football as a whole.

South Korea certainly embraced the gift given to them by Fifa. Their coach Hong Myung-Bo was part of Dutchman Guus Hiddink's fourth-placed finishers at that tournament. Two further Dutch coaches followed, as did several South Korean playing exports to western European club sides.

Once seen as whipping boys, the Taeguk Warriors are anything but these days and are seen as genuine challengers to qualify. This is their eighth consecutive World Cup finals appearance and they have progressed past the group stage in two of the last three editions.

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: South Korea

Key player

Twenty-one-year-old Son Heung Min is turning into the main creative force under Hong. Bayer Leverkusen's club record signing at £8.5m, he already has four years' worth of Bundesliga experience under his belt. Created 126 chances at Leverkusen this season, including four assists. For a youthful South Korea to be successful in Brazil.

One to watch

Kim Young-Gwon mirrors the warrior-like centre-back role performed with distinction by current head coach Hong Myung-Bo during his playing days. Aged just 24, Kim has been tipped for a bright future by club manager Marcello Lippi, Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach.

The boss

Hong Myung-Bo is a South Korea hero; captain of their 2002 World Cup squad that finished fourth, he was named by Pele in 2003 as one of the greatest 125 living footballers. He led South Korea to a bronze medal at the London Olympics and was the natural choice to take over a country looking for leadership last summer.

He has done so confidently, with a new direction and without fanfare.

How they qualified

They edged Uzbekistan out on goal difference to claim the second qualification spot in Asian Group A, ending two points behind Iran. However, laboured performances, including home and away defeats to Iran and away to Lebanon, prompted coach Choi Kang-hee to quit at the end of the campaign.

World Cup record

They have made group stage exits in six of eight tournaments. The Koreans rode their luck to reach the semi-finals on home soil in 2002, and lost to Uruguay in the last 16 in 2010.

274,"Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Switzerland

SWITZERLAND (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: Switzerland play a neat passing game and press the opposition. They display far more urgency and attacking intent than the Swiss side criticised for defensive tactics at the last World Cup.

The two central midfielders keep a disciplined shape in front of the back four, although one will drive forward when the Swiss attack. The left-footed Xherdan Shaqiri starts wide on the right in a 4-2-3-1 system but regularly drifts into central positions, allowing marauding right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner to venture down the wing. The link-up play between the two is a key part of the team's attacking arsenal.

Strengths: Bayern Munich's Shaqiri is one of the most highly-regarded young players in Europe and he is among seven members of Switzerland's strongest XI who played for a top-six club in Italy or Germany this season. Full-backs Lichtsteiner and Ricardo Rodriguez are a class pairing; they encapsulate the team's energy and provided the most goal assists by a defender in their respective leagues this season.

Weaknesses: There are fitness and quality concerns in central defence and the team can be vulnerable to the counter attack, especially down the right due to Lichtsteiner bombing forward and Shaqiri not tracking back. Josip Drmic may be the top-class striker they need but he's unproven at international level.

Key player

Kosovo-born Xherdan Shaqiri, 22, is still part of the supporting cast at Bayern Munich but he takes a lead role for Switzerland as their key creative force.

An instinctive player, the stocky left-footed livewire starts wide on the right but regularly roams infield. Three hamstring tears this season are a concern.

One to watch

Josip Drmic could be the answer to Switzerland's prayers for a top striker. A stellar 2013-14 season included two goals in the March friendly against his parents' native Croatia and 17 goals for Nurnberg, earning him a move to Bayer Leverkusen.

The boss

Ottmar Hitzfeld will retire after the World Cup, six years after taking charge. The German, 65, has infused the side with youth since the failure to qualify for Euro 2012 and he says: ""This is a team that doesn't hide. We are willing to take risks."" His 19 major club trophies include two Champions League titles.

How they qualified

Switzerland qualified with a match to spare for the first time, finishing unbeaten in a relatively weak group and keeping clean sheets in seven of their 10 matches.

World Cup record

The Swiss have reached three quarter-finals, but none since hosting the tournament in 1954.

In 2010, they failed to get out of their group despite an opening 1-0 win over champions Spain.

Fifa ranking: 6

Possible starting XI

Squad

Goalkeepers: Diego Benaglio (Wolfsburg), Roman Buerki (Grasshopper), Yann Sommer (Basel).

Defenders: Johan Djourou (Hamburg), Michael Lang (Grasshopper), Stephan Lichtsteiner (Juventus), Ricardo Rodriguez (Wolfsburg), Fabian Schaer (Basel), Philippe Senderos (Valencia), Steve von Bergen (Young Boys), Reto Ziegler (Sassuolo).

ECUADOR

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Ecuador

Prospects

Ecuador's World Cup plan hinges on wingers and a prayer. They shift the ball out quickly to the flanks, where captain Antonio Valencia offers pace and power down the right and Jefferson Montero is full of daring and dribbles on the left. The full-backs join in as auxiliary wingers, a position they often play for their clubs.

The tactic can be effective, particularly on the counter attack, but playing with two wide men and two forwards leaves a ponderous central defence exposed.

The death of forward Christian Benitez last summer has also upset the balance of the side, with no like-for-like replacement available.

Key player

Unplayable at times, infuriating at others, left winger Jefferson Montero is pivotal to Ecuador's prospects of advancing to the knockout stage. Coach Reinaldo Rueda is constantly on his case to become more consistent but admits: ""He's the kind of player spectators love to watch because he plays like a kid in the street, throwing opponents off balance.""

Mexico-based Montero, 24, has been linked with a summer move to Europe.

One to watch

Midfielder Christhian Noboa is integral to Ecuador's modus operandi. The 29-year-old has the vision and range of passing to supply the wingers and also has the task of protecting Ecuador's suspect centre-backs.

Noboa, of Dynamo Moscow, ate some snow on his first day in Russia seven years ago and was sick for the next week.

The boss

Colombian Reinaldo Rueda was appointed in 2010 after guiding Ecuador's Group E opponents Honduras to their first World Cup for 28 years in South Africa. Rueda's first year in charge of Ecuador was disastrous and he hurriedly reshaped the team after they failed to win a game at the 2011 Copa America

How they qualified

Ecuador were second in the South American standings after 10 matches but only won one of their last six matches. Crucially, that victory in the penultimate fixture was against nearest rivals Uruguay to all but secure the last automatic qualifying spot.

Coach Reinaldo Rueda dedicated the achievement to key forward Christian Benitez, who died suddenly last July from heart failure.

They only dropped two points in Quito, the altitude sickness-inducing capital, but failed to win a single away game.

World Cup record

Ecuador's first World Cup was 2002, when they finished bottom of their group. Four years later, they won two group games but lost to England in the last 16.

Fifa ranking: 26

Squad

Goalkeepers: Maximo Banguera (Barcelona SC), Alexander Dominguez (LDU Quito), Adrian Bone (El Nacional).

FRANCE

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: France

Prospects

It is now apparent that France's daily sports newspaper L'Equipe was rather hasty to ask ""Is this the worst French team in history?"" after the first leg defeat against Ukraine in a World Cup play-off.

If that game was the nadir for a France side still bruised by abject displays and player unrest at the last two major tournaments, then the 3-0 victory in the second leg has signalled a renaissance.

Coach Didier Deschamps says France ""are no longer among the elite teams""; those that are will not relish facing them - though the loss of Franck Ribery to injury was a major blow on the eve of the tournament.

Key player

Striker Karim Benzema was briefly dropped from the national side last autumn amid a 15-match goal drought for France, but he has thrived as the spearhead of a new-look three-man attack with four goals in his last five internationals as of 7 June.

Benzema, 26, responded well to early-season criticism from Real Madrid's supporters, ending the season with 24 goals for the club in all competitions.

One to watch

Midfielder Paul Pogba, 21, has excelled since defying Sir Alex Ferguson and leaving Manchester United for Juventus in 2012. He was voted Europe's best Under-21 player for 2013 and Pogba's agent claims the midfielder is ""as valuable as a Salvador Dali"" painting.

France coach Didier Deschamps has hailed Pogba's athleticism and quality but says the player must learn to adopt ""the highest level concentration and application"".

The boss

A World Cup-winning captain in 1998, Didier Deschamps took charge after Euro 2012.

He had the worst record of any France coach after a year in the job, but his desire to build an athletic side that ""imposes itself on its opponents"" has gradually reaped results. He has also brought unity to the squad after years of dressing-room disharmony.

How they qualified

They became the first European side to overturn a two-goal deficit in the play-offs, beating Ukraine with an impressive 3-0 home win - albeit benefiting from an offside goal from striker Karim Benzema. Prior to that second leg, 84% of French fans had predicted failure. France went into the play-offs after finishing three points behind Spain in their group.

World Cup record

Winners in 1998, runners-up in 2006 and semi-finalists in 1958, 1982 and 1986, their best performances have tended to come close to home. Only once have they reached the knockout stage outside of Europe - that was at Mexico 86.

HONDURAS

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Honduras

Prospects

Qualifying for a second successive World Cup was an unprecedented achievement, and Honduras coach Luis Fernando Suarez says ""it's time to take the next step"". A first World Cup win would represent the progress that Suarez seeks, but it is hard to disagree with the bookmakers' assessment of Honduras as tournament outsiders.

They are a physical and compact side who play 4-4-2 and it's a reflection of the team's lack of creativity that the full-backs tend to offer their most potent threat. Set pieces and counter attacks provide the Central American nation's best hope of causing an upset.

Key player

Jerry Bengtson was the team's nine-goal top scorer in the World Cup qualifying stage and is considered so important to the Honduran cause that he avoided sanction for walking out on the squad ahead of a game last summer.

Bengtson, 27, has yet to make an impact in Major League Soccer with New England Revolution but he has always scored goals for his country and is a particular threat with his aerial prowess.

One to watch

Winger Andy Najar was smuggled into the USA by his parents as a 13-year-old and he has proved to be one of Honduran football's best exports in his first full season with Anderlecht.

Now 21, Najar impressed with his pace and dynamism as the Belgian club won a third straight league title. Though not assured of a starting spot for his country, his qualities provide Honduras with a different option.

The boss

Colombian Luis Fernando Suarez has World Cup experience, having guided Ecuador to the last 16 for the first time in 2006 before they were knocked out by England.

Since taking charge of Honduras, he has led them to the semi-finals of the two most recent Gold Cups and coached the Olympic Games team that reached the quarter-finals at London 2012. .

How they qualified

They finished third in the final round of qualifying despite keeping just two clean sheets in 10 games. Highlights included 2-1 wins at home to the USA and away to Mexico, before a 2-2 draw in Jamaica sealed qualification.

World Cup record

They failed to win a game (D3, L3) in their two previous campaigns (1982 and 2010). While they did not score a goal in South Africa they were not embarrassed in losses to Chile and Spain, and salvaged pride with a draw against Switzerland.

Fifa ranking: 33

SPAIN (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: Overrun and out-muscled by Brazil in the 2013 Confederations Cup final, Vicente del Bosque is likely to start with Xabi Alonso alongside Sergio Busquets as duel defensive midfield 'pivots'.

Xavi will dictate the tempo in front of them in a more advanced role than he plays for Barcelona.

But it's up front where things get interesting, Cesc Fabregas will continue as a 'false nine', but in Diego Costa they have a strikingly different Plan B to call upon. Guile comes from Andres Iniesta and Pedro, while Jordi Alba acts as an auxiliary winger.

Strengths: Spain's squad averages 60 caps per man and contains some of the most decorated players in football history, backed up by a bench containing the likes of Diego Costa, Santi Cazorla, Koke and David Silva.

Sergio Ramos leads a defence that hasn't let in a goal in 10 knockout matches at the Euros in 2008 and 2012, and the last World Cup.

Weaknesses: Brazil showed last summer that aggressively denying Spain time and space at the base of their midfield negates the stranglehold they can put on a match through having endless possession.

A long season has left key players carrying injuries, while has time caught up with Xavi's career?

Key player

Playing at centre-back in a team bristling with stars can result in getting overlooked but Spain would truly miss enterprising yet robust defender Sergio Ramos.

Capped 115 times at the age of 27, he has started 18 of their last 19 tournament matches and was ever-present during qualifying.

One to watch

Striker Diego Costa chose adopted nation Spain over Brazil, the country of his birth, and can expect a hostile reception from home fans.

The 25-year-old played twice for Brazil in March 2013 but was able to switch allegiance as neither were competitive fixtures.

The boss

Vicente Del Bosque is aiming to become only the second coach in history to win two World Cups. Add in the 2012 Euros and it makes Real Madrid's decision to sack him after two Champions League wins because they wanted ""someone with more emphasis on tactics, strategy and physical preparation"" seem a little foolish.

How they qualified

The holders emerged unbeaten over their eight matches, with back-to-back home draws against Finland and France a mere blip. They did not trail at any stage of qualification.

World Cup record

Spain finally shook off their bridesmaid tag in winning the last World Cup; their previous best had been fourth in Brazil in 1950.

Fifa ranking: 1

Possible starting XI

Squad

Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Pepe Reina (Napoli), David De Gea (Manchester United).

Defenders: Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Raul Albiol (Napoli), Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid), Jordi Alba (Barcelona).

Midfielders: Xavi (Barcelona), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Santi Cazorla (Arsenal), Koke (Atletico Madrid), Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich).

Forwards: David Silva (Manchester City), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid), Fernando Torres (Chelsea), Pedro (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Manchester United), David Villa (Atletico Madrid).

NETHERLANDS

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profiles -The Netherlands

Prospects

As ever with the Dutch at a major tournament, it is difficult to predict how they will fare. The 2010 World Cup finalists went unbeaten in 2013, scoring goals for fun, but that achievement is less impressive when you look at who they faced.

Any team containing Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie will pose a threat but the loss of midfield colossus Kevin Strootman is a huge blow. His absence, plus an inexperienced defence, has prompted Manchester United's manager-in-waiting Louis van Gaal to switch to a unfamiliar 5-3-2 formation that has Dutch purists furrowing their brows.

Key player

Arjen Robben has given a series of coruscating displays for Bayern Munich over the last couple of seasons, including scoring the winner in the 2013 Champions League final. Let's not forget Robin van Persie, who scored 11 goals in nine qualifiers to overtake Patrick Kluivert as the Netherlands' all-time record scorer.

One to watch

A superb season has seen Daley Blind firmly emerge from the shadow of his father, legendary Ajax and Oranje player Danny.

Ajax boss Frank de Boer has overseen his transformation from a defender to a defensive midfield 'pivot' with great success, but Louis van Gaal is expected to play him as a left wing-back. Once booed by the Ajax crowd, they now revere a player who won the Dutch league's Player of the Year award this season.

The boss

New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has won league titles with Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ Alkmaar. Appointed as Netherlands boss in 2012, he has Danny Blind and Patrick Kluivert, who won the Champions League at Ajax under him, on his coaching staff.

How they qualified

They won nine of their 10 matches and scored 34 goals, with only a 2-2 draw against Estonia denying them a perfect record. That said, few countries had easier opposition - none of their opponents were ranked in Fifa's top 30.

World Cup record

The Dutch suffered World Cup final heartbreak for a third time in 2010 when they lost to Spain, adding to the defeats their great teams suffered in 1974 and 1978. Brazil will be their 10th World Cup finals.

Fifa ranking: 15

Squad

Goalkeepers: Jasper Cillessen (Ajax), Tim Krul (Newcastle), Michel Vorm (Swansea)

Defenders: Daley Blind, Joel Veltman (both Ajax), Stefan de Vrij, Daryl Janmaat, Terence Kongolo, Bruno Martins Indi, (all Feyenoord), Paul Verhaegh (FC Augsburg), Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa).

Midfielders: Jordy Clasie (Feyenoord), Jonathan de Guzman (Swansea), Nigel de Jong (AC Milan), Leroy Fer (Norwich), Arjen Robben (Bayern Munich), Wesley Sneijder (Galatasaray), Georginio Wijnaldum (PSV Eindhoven).

Forwards: Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven), Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (Schalke 04), Dirk Kuyt (Fenerbahce), Jeremain Lens (Dynamo Kiev), Robin van Persie (Manchester United).

CHILE

Prospects

New coach Jorge Sampaoli has brought a swagger back to Chile's football, combining aggressive pressing with a fluent passing game. Fun to watch, tough to play against, La Roja have the potential to reach the quarter-finals for only the second time in their history - if their best 11 stay fit.

Key player

Lightning quick Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez, 25, hit a rich vein of goalscoring form for club and country over the course of the season. Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal is equally indispensable, although the 27-year-old has recently had surgery on his knee.

One to watch

Jorge Valdivia is as much a playboy as he is a playmaker but he remains a fantastic talent.

""El Mago"" (The Magician) is in his 30s, but his brilliant eye for a defence-splitting pass is undimmed. The classic number 10 has served two lengthy bans from international football for but retains the faith of coach Sampaoli, who calls him an ""irreplaceable talent"".

The boss

Jorge Sampaoli replaced Claudio Borghi midway through qualifying, quickly reviving Chilean fortunes. A self-confessed disciple of fellow Argentine Marcelo Bielsa (who led Chile in 2010) he is a passionate, energetic touchline presence. Early in his career he was blocked from watching his lower league team play, so climbed a nearby tree, from where he bawled instructions at his players.

How they qualified

They finished third in South American qualifying despite a mid-campaign wobble which saw them lose four games in a row. A change in coach halted the slump, and they recovered to win five of their last six games.

World Cup record

This is only the third time they have qualified in eight tournaments, but they did reach the last 16 in 1998 and 2010 - losing to Brazil on both occasions. They got to the semi-finals on home soil in 1962, again losing to the Brazilians.

Fifa ranking: 14

Squad

Goalkeepers: Claudio Bravo (Real Sociedad), Johnny Herrera (Universidad de Chile), Cristopher Toselli (Universidad Catolica).

Defenders: Gary Medel (Cardiff City), Gonzalo Jara (Nottingham Forest), Jose Rojas (Universidad de Chile), Eugenio Mena (Santos), Mauricio Isla (Juventus).

Midfielders: Jorge Valdivia (Palmeiras), Felipe Gutierrez (Twente), Jose Pedro Fuenzalida (Colo Colo), Francisco Silva (Osasuna), Arturo Vidal (Juventus), Charles Aranguiz (Internacional), Marcelo Diaz (Basel), Carlos Carmona (Atalanta), Miiko Albornoz (Malmo).

Forwards: Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona), Esteban Paredes (Colo Colo) Eduardo Vargas (Valencia), Jean Beausejour (Wigan Athletic), Mauricio Pinilla (Cagliari), Fabian Orellana (Celta).

AUSTRALIA

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile - Australia

Prospects

Australia are the lowest ranked country to qualify, and the remit for new coach Ange Postecoglou is to bring through the youth. His predecessor Holger Osieck was sacked in October after back-to-back 6-0 defeats by Brazil and France, having been accused of staying too loyal to the Socceroos' ageing players.

Key player

Australia's player of the year and newly appointed captain, Mile Jedinak, will have to play a vital role as chief midfield protector if the Socceroos are to enjoy a fruitful World Cup. In the prime of his career, the Crystal Palace skipper can also play in defence.

One to watch

Mathew Ryan has just been named as the Belgian league's goalkeeper of the year in his very first season in European football.

The man tasked with replacing Mark Schwarzer in the national team is learning from one of the best at Club Brugge - his head coach is legendary Belgian Michel Preud'homme, winner of the Yashin Award for best goalkeeper at the 1994 World Cup.

The boss

Ange Postecoglou stated ""when your country calls, you answer"" after signing a five-year deal. As a player, Greek-born Postecoglou won four Australia caps. He is a former national youth-team coach and led Brisbane Roar to two A-League titles. He has forged a reputation for starting and reviving numerous careers.

How they qualified

Now firmly established as an Asian Football Federation member, the Socceroos qualified automatically behind Japan but their passage to Brazil was not easy. Winless in their first three matches, they went unbeaten over the last five and secured their place seven minutes from time in the final game against Iraq.

World Cup record

They have reached their third successive finals, and their fourth in total. Under Guus Hiddink, they reached the last 16 in 2006 but lost in stoppage time to eventual winners Italy.

Fifa ranking: 62

Squad

Goalkeepers: Eugene Galekovic (Adelaide United), Mitchell Langerak (Borussia Dortmund), Mat Ryan (Club Brugge).

Defenders: Jason Davidson (Heracles Almelo), Ivan Franjic (Brisbane Roar), Ryan McGowan (Shandong Luneng Taishan), Matthew Spiranovic (Western Sydney Wanderers), Alex Wilkinson (Jeonbuk Hyundai), Bailey Wright (Preston North End).

Midfielders: Oliver Bozanic (Luzern), Mark Bresciano (Al Gharafa), James Holland (Austria Vienna), Mile Jedinak (Crystal Palace), Massimo Luongo (Swindon Town), Matthew McKay (Brisbane Roar), Mark Milligan (Melbourne Victory), Tommy Oar (Utrecht), James Troisi (Melbourne Victory), Dario Vidosic (Sion).

Forwards: Tim Cahill (New York Red Bulls), Ben Halloran (Fortuna Dusseldorf), Matthew Leckie (FSV Frankfurt 1899), Adam Taggart (Newcastle Jets).

276,"Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Colombia

COLOMBIA (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: After years of underachievement whilst employing defensive tactics, Colombia have reaped the benefits of attack-minded variations of 4-4-2 and 4-2-2-2.

Playmaker James Rodriguez roams inside, retreating to the left when out of possession, while the full-backs surge forward to provide width, often leaving just one genuine holding midfielder covering.

It's thrilling when it works but leaves them vulnerable to counter-attacks.

Strengths: The squad has plenty of attacking talents in fine form. Jackson Martinez hit 29 goals for Porto this term, while Carlos Bacca scored 21 for Sevilla. Huge numbers of fans will travel to cheer on the team and their itinerary involves relatively short flights from their Sao Paulo base.

Moreover, hot conditions won't bother them - they played qualifiers in the sweltering Caribbean port of Barranquilla, opting for mid-afternoon kick-offs in the belief their rivals would wilt in the heat.

Weaknesses: The absence of the iconic Falcao - a supreme predator with 20 goals in 51 caps and 155 goals in 198 club games since arriving in Europe.

Key centre-back Luis Perea is also ruled out so there are big question marks over the back four. Captain Mario Yepes, 38, is cripplingly slow, while Cristian Zapata and Pablo Armero have lost their places at club level and Juan Zuniga has barely played due to injury.

Key player

With Falcao not fit, the burden of expectation falls on Monaco team-mate James Rodriguez, an elegant number 10 who created more chances (43) than any other player in South American qualifying. The gifted left footer, who cost Monaco £37.5m last summer, topped the Ligue 1 charts for assists (12) this season. Shut him down and Colombia may struggle.

One to watch

Juan Cuadrado has blossomed at Fiorentina and was Serie A's best winger this term, with his explosive pace and ferocious shot yielding 15 goals. His passing accuracy (89.1%) was the highest of any regular Colombian player in World Cup qualifying.

The boss

Carlos Valderrama says Jose Pekerman, the Cafeteros' first foreign coach for over 30 years, has given Colombian football its identity back by reverting to an attacking philosophy.

The Argentine replaced Leonel Alvarez after Colombia made a stuttering start to qualifying for Brazil. He led his native country to the last eight of the 2006 World Cup.

How they qualified

Fairly comfortably, finishing a close second to Argentina. Their haul of 30 points from 16 games represents their best ever return. Outstanding performances included a 4-0 win at home to Uruguay and a 3-1 win in Chile, plus a gritty goalless draw in Argentina.

World Cup record

In four campaigns they've reached the last 16 only once, losing to Cameroon in 1990.

Painful memories still linger from USA 94; defender Andres Escobar was murdered in his hometown of Medellin after scoring a crucial own goal at the tournament.

Fifa ranking: 8

Possible starting XI

Squad

Goalkeepers: David Ospina (Nice), Faryd Mondragon (Deportivo Cali), Camilo Vargas (Independiente Santa Fe).

Defenders: Mario Yepes (AC Milan), Cristian Zapata (AC Milan), Pablo Armero (West Ham, on loan from Napoli), Camilo Zuniga (Napoli), Santiago Arias (PSV Eindhoven), Eder Alvarez Balanta (River Plate), Carlos Valdes (San Lorenzo).

Midfielders: Fredy Guarin (Inter Milan), Juan Cuadrado (Fiorentina), James Rodriguez (Monaco), Abel Aguilar (Toulouse), Juan Fernando Quintero (Porto), Carlos Sanchez (Elche), Carlos Carbonero (River Plate), Alexander Mejia (Atletico Nacional),

Forwards: Victor Ibarbo (Cagliari), Jackson Martinez (Porto), Carlos Bacca (Sevilla), Adrian Ramos (Hertha Berlin), Teofilo Gutierrez (River Plate).

IVORY COAST

Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Ivory Coast

Prospects

The Ivorians' golden generation may have a grey-ish tinge but a kind draw (for once) has given them a golden chance of reaching the last 16 for the first time. But while their attacking options are formidable, the back line doesn't inspire confidence. This Ivorian team has flattered to deceive, with their failure to win at least one Africa Cup of Nations mystifying. They must avoid another early exit to shed their ""chokers"" tag.

Key player

Manchester City powerhouse Yaya Toure scored four times in six qualifiers, a tally bettered only by Lille forward Salomon Kalou.

Yaya Toure and Kalou were the Ivorians' top scorers in qualifying

The boss

The appointment of Sabri Lamouchi in May 2012 was hugely controversial. A France international who played at Euro 1996, he had no previous coaching experience. He dropped Didier Drogba after a disappointing 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, but recalled the veteran striker last August.

How they qualified

Along with Nigeria, they were the only African side to end unbeaten. They easily topped their preliminary group ahead of Morocco before winning a play-off against Senegal 4-2 on aggregate. There were some nervy moments when they trailed 1-0 in the second leg in Casablanca, but Salomon Kalou's injury-time equaliser booked their place in Brazil.

World Cup record

They were drawn in the ""Group of Death"" in their two previous tournaments. On both occasions they ended third, trailing Argentina and the Netherlands in 2006 and Brazil and Portugal in 2010.

Fifa ranking: 23 (joint)

Squad

Goalkeepers: Boubacar Barry (Lokeren), Sylvain Gbohouo (Sewe Sport), Sayouba Sande (Stabaek).

Defenders: Kolo Toure (Liverpool), Sol Bamba (Trabzonspor), Didier Zokora (Trabzonspor), Serge Aurier (Toulouse), Arthur Boka (Stuttgart), Ousmane Viera Diarrassouba (Caykur Rizespor), Constant Djakpa (Frankfurt), Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro (Toulouse).

Midfielders: Yaya Toure (Manchester City), Cheick Tiote (Newcastle), Serey Die (Basel), Max Gradel (Saint Etienne), Diomande Ismael (Saint Etienne), Didier Ya Konan (Hannover), Mathis Bolly (Dusseldorf).

Forwards: Gervinho (Roma), Didier Drogba (Galatasaray), Salomon Kalou (Lille), Wilfried Bony (Swansea), Giovanni Sio (Basel).

GREECE

Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Greece

Prospects

Despite their lofty Fifa ranking of 12th, the bookies rate Greece as outsiders to progress from Group C and the weakest European side in Brazil. Shock winners of Euro 2004, you can get odds of over 300/1 on Greece lightning striking twice this summer. There is a chronic lack of midfield creativity and little goal threat up front - especially if Kostas Mitroglou isn't fit and firing. But boss Fernando Santos knows how to get the most out of his limited resources and the Greeks' team spirit is second to none.

Key player

Greece's hopes of advancing beyond the group stage for the first time may depend on which Kostas Mitroglou we see in Brazil - the deadly ""Mitrogoal"" who hit 23 goals in 23 games for Olympiakos and Greece prior to the turn of the year, or the injury-cursed flop who made just three appearances for Fulham in 2014.

The boss

Portuguese coach Fernando Santos took over in 2010, but admits the legacy of predecessor Otto Rehhagel, under whom Greece won Euro 2004, remains ""an identity that is not easy to change. We've tried to play a different way [but] then we slipped back into our comfort zone, our defensive strength"". He will leave his post after Brazil.

How they qualified

Greece finished as runners-up to Bosnia-Hercegovina in Group G but were seeded for the play-offs, and beat Romania 4-2 on aggregate, thanks largely to Mitroglou.

World Cup record

Their two previous campaigns (1994 and 2010) ended at the group stage.

They did at least claim their first victory in South Africa, beating Nigeria, but bowed out following defeat by Argentina in Rehhagel's final game in charge.

Fifa ranking: 12

Squad

Goalkeepers: Orestis Karnezis (Granada), Panagiotis Glykos (PAOK), Stefanos Kapino (Panathinaikos).

Defenders: Kostas Manolas, Giannis Maniatis, Jose Holebas (all Olympiakos), Sokratis Papastathopoulos (Borussia Dortmund), Giorgios Tzavellas (PAOK), Loukas Vyntra (Levante), Vasilis Torosidis (Roma), Vangelis Moras (Verona).

Midfielders: Alexandros Tziolis (Kayserispor), Andreas Samaris (Olympiakos), Kostas Katsouranis (PAOK), Giorgos Karagounis (Fulham), Panagiotis Tachtsidis (Torino), Ioannis Fetfatzidis (Genoa), Lazaros Christodoulopoulos (Bologna), Panagiotis Kone (Bologna).

Forwards: Dimitris Salpingidis (PAOK), Giorgios Samaras (Celtic), Konstantinos Mitroglou (Fulham), Theofanis Gekas (Konyaspor).

JAPAN

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Japan

Prospects

The Asian champions have the technical ability to out-pass all of their Group C opponents but their Achilles heel remains a lack of striking options, meaning goals usually come from midfield. They will learn from last year's chastening Confederations Cup campaign, when they ran out of steam late in matches, exposing defensive weaknesses. But November's draw in the Netherlands and a win in Belgium have revived hopes that Japan could yet be a surprise package.

Key player

Keisuke Honda, 27, revels in his central, attacking role for the Blue Samurai. But he has looked out of sorts since a January move to AC Milan, where he's been mainly deployed on the right wing. Like Manchester United's Shinji Kagawa, he will hope to leave his poor club form behind in Brazil.

The boss

Alberto Zaccheroni is Japan's sixth foreign head coach. The Italian went unbeaten in his first 16 games, including victory at the 2011 Asia Cup. His honeymoon ended with the Confederations Cup disappointment and poor performances in friendlies but results have improved recently. He led AC Milan to the Serie A title in 1999.

How they qualified

Japan were the first country to qualify for the 2014 finals, doing so in early June 2013. They achieved the most points (17) and top scored (16 goals) in Asia's final qualifying group stage.

World Cup record

Japan made their debut in 1998 and will be appearing at their fifth straight World Cup finals. They have twice reached the last 16, first doing so on home soil in 2002 when beaten by eventual third-placed team Turkey.

Fifa ranking: 46

Squad

Goalkeepers: Eiji Kawashima (Standard Liege), Shusaku Nishikawa (Urawa Reds), Shuichi Gonda (FC Tokyo).

Defenders: Masato Morishige (FC Tokyo), Yasuyuki Konno (Gamba Osaka), Yuto Nagatomo (Inter Milan), Maya Yoshida (Southampton), Masahiko Inoha (Jubilo Iwata), Atsuto Uchida (Schalke 04), Hiroki Sakai (Hannover 96), Gotoku Sakai (VfB Stuttgart).

Midfielders: Yasuhito Endo (Gamba Osaka), Keisuke Honda (AC Milan), Shinji Kagawa (Manchester United), Makoto Hasebe (FC Nuremberg), Hiroshi Kiyotake (FC Nuremberg), Hotaru Yamaguchi (Cerezo Osaka), Toshihiro Aoyama (Sanfrecce Hiroshima), Manabu Saito (Yokohama F Marinos).

277,"Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Germany

GERMANY (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: Blessed with far more flair than many Germany sides of the past, their fluid 4-2-3-1 is underpinned by Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira - recently back from a long-term injury - anchoring the side from the base of midfield.

Ahead of them lies creative fulcrum Mesut Ozil, who is likely to be flanked by Thomas Muller plus one from a number of other options. Marco Reus, a likely starter, withdrew through injury on 7 June.

Strengths: They have an incredible array of attacking midfielders that guarantee goals. Manuel Neuer can lay claim to being the world's best goalkeeper and Philipp Lahm, whatever position he plays in, brings calmness and tactical nous along with his vice-captain Schweinsteiger. The free-scoring Muller has a priceless knack of being in the right place at the right time.

Weaknesses: More than you'd imagine. Left-back is an issue for coach Joachim Low, while the defence as a whole has been porous of late and was given a torrid time by Chile's movement in a friendly in March. Khedira and Schweinsteiger have had injury-hit seasons and can Ozil shake off his Arsenal torpor?

Miroslav Klose is just one goal shy of Ronaldo's all-time World Cup finals tally of 15, but turning 36 means his powers are surely on the wane.

Key player

Philipp Lahm was described by Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola this season as ""the most intelligent player I've ever coached"". The best right-back in Europe over the last decade has made a seamless transition this season under the Bayern boss into the Sechser (sixer) position in midfield and may well do the same for Germany.

One to watch

Borussia Dortmund's Erik Durm has been transformed from a forward into a full-back over the last year, and his club manager Jurgen Klopp has called him an ""extraordinary talent"".

Blessed with incredible stamina and pace, 22-year-old Durm has usurped Marcel Schmelzer at left-back for club and country.

The boss

At the helm since 2006, Joachim Low signed a new contract until 2016 earlier this year but the pressure is on to win a trophy after some agonising near-misses. His win percentage is the highest of any Germany manager.

How they qualified

Germany breezed through their qualifying group, only dropping points in a bizarre 4-4 draw with Sweden - having led 4-0. They scored 36 times in 10 matches, with seven of their attacking players totalling three goals or more.

World Cup record

Germany have reached the final seven times, winning for the third time in 1990.

Runners-up in 2002, they were third in 2006 and 2010.

PORTUGAL

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Portugal

Prospects

With Cristiano Ronaldo in your team, the sky's the limit. However, getting out of a very tricky group will be their primary objective before they can start thinking of a potential quarter-final against Argentina. The likes of Pepe and Joao Moutinho give them a strong spine, but they remain without a world-class striker, meaning the goalscoring burden rests with Ronaldo.

Will Cristiano Ronaldo finally bring his club form to the World Cup stage in Brazil?

They could be forgiven for thinking they are playing in Lisbon such is the expected level of support for them from the Brazilian public. There have been too many laboured team displays since they were beaten on penalties by Spain in their Euro 2012 semi-final.

Key player

Who else but CR7? Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo scored 51 goals in 47 club appearances this season and already has a museum dedicated to him. Debate rages about who is better out of him and Lionel Messi, but in Portugal they now argue over who wins out of Ronaldo and Eusebio.

However, carrying injuries into this tournament won't help his bid to right the wrongs of two disappointing World Cups for him in 2006 and 2010.

One to watch

Blessed with a calmness that belies his 21 years, William Carvalho made an ice-cool debut off the bench in the play-off second leg against Sweden.

The Angolan-born defensive midfielder has had a superb first season in the first team at Sporting Lisbon and the likes of Manchester United have been circling. A Sporting fan, he famously turned Benfica officials away from his house when they tried to sign him as a 13 year old.

The boss

Paulo Bento was banned for six months after he manhandled officials during a controversial Euro 2000 semi-final with France but he has matured into a top-class coach. Capped 35 times, he has the respect of his players and his greatest triumph has arguably been getting Cristiano Ronaldo, his former team-mate at Sporting Lisbon, to replicate his extraordinary club form on the international stage.

Derided in some quarters for so-called negative tactics, he recently had his contract extended to the end of Euro 2016.

How they qualified

They progressed via the play-offs for the second successive World Cup, with Ronaldo's hat-trick against Sweden equalling Pauleta's national record 47-goal tally, which he has since broken.

They only lost to Russia in their group but finished second after drawing with Northern Ireland and Israel, twice.

World Cup record

Portugal are heading to their sixth World Cup. They came third on their debut in 1966 and were also semi-finalists in 2006. Three years ago, they lost to eventual champions Spain in the last 16.

GHANA

Prospects

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Ghana

The Black Stars were fancied to repeat, or even improve on, their run to the quarter-finals in 2010 in Brazil. That was until the draw was made and they were pitted with the world's second and fourth-ranked sides.

However, confidence is not an issue in the Ghana camp and why should it be? Their team, offensively at least, is packed with experience and world-class talent. Michael Essien's return has been crucial, while Asamoah Gyan's time in the Middle East hasn't blunted his goalscoring touch.

Key player

Michael Essien's return from international exile came just at the right time for Ghana. 'The Bison', who says he sleeps for ""up to 12 hours a day"" was certainly wide awake during the epic play-off thrashing of Egypt where he reminded everyone just how an effective and tactically adept midfielder he is. He has a special bond with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who says he would play him in any position bar ""goalkeeper or striker"".

One to watch

Kwadwo Asamoah has quietly established himself a key man for both club and country.

At Juventus, where he has won two titles in two seasons, the midfielder is described as ""irreplaceable"" by manager Antonio Conte. He has won Ghana's Footballer of the Year award for the last two years.

The boss

Former Ghana captain James Kwesi Appiah spent four years as assistant with the national side before his promotion. Softly spoken and unassuming, ""I'm a coach who doesn't talk that much"", the Ghana players have nicknamed him the 'Silent Killer' and he certainly isn't afraid to take on the big names in his dressing room if they step out of line.

He wasn't a popular appointment originally, as he wasn't deemed to be high profile enough. He is the first Ghanaian to lead his nation at a World Cup.

How they qualified

Having won their group with five wins out of six, Ghana thrashed Egypt 6-1 in the home leg of their play-off to ensure a 2-1 loss in the return leg was academic.

They ended as the top scorers in African qualifying with 25 goals.

World Cup record

In 2010, Ghana seemed certain to become the first African semi-finalists after Uruguay's Luis Suarez was sent off for handling on the line in the dying seconds of extra-time. However, Asamoah Gyan missed the spot-kick and Ghana then lost the penalty shootout.

Brazil will be their third successive finals, having first qualified in 2006 when they went on to reach the last 16.

Fifa ranking: 37

UNITED STATES

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: USA

Prospects

Head coach Jurgen Klinsmann says the minimum aim is to reach the knockout stage, and a national record 16 wins in 2013 - including against an admittedly depleted Germany - gives cause for confidence.

Defence is a concern and then there's the lack of continuity - 37 players were used in qualifying.

Key player

US coach Jurgen Klinsmann scored 11 goals in three World Cups for Germany in the 1990s.

With eight goals during the qualifying campaign, and 36 in 103 caps, captain Clint Dempsey continues to provide the attacking thrust he demonstrated so regularly in the Premier League with Fulham and Tottenham. An honourable mention, too, for Sunderland forward Jozy Altidore, who excelled during the final qualifying group phase.

One to watch

Nicknamed 'Zeus', Graham Zusi has made lightning quick progression in international football.

The right-sided midfielder is a gifted passer and deadball specialist, and his tremendous work ethic makes him a Klinsmann favourite. He is not just popular in America, in Mexico he is known as San Zusi (Saint Zusi) as his goal against Panama helped Mexico make it to Brazil.

The boss

Since taking over three years ago former Germany player and head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has led the US to a series of notable results. These include their first victories away in Italy and in Mexico, a debut win in Jamaica in a World Cup qualifier and a victory over his native Germany.

This, plus a record-breaking 12-game winning sequence in 2013, led to his contract being extended to end of the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. His new deal, signed in December 2013, also gives him the extra title of the US Soccer Federation's technical director.

How they qualified

They recovered from an opening 2-1 defeat by Honduras to finish four points clear at the top of the six-team final group phase, winning all five home matches.

World Cup record

The USA will be playing in their 10th World Cup, and seventh in succession.

They were third in 1930 and quarter-finalists in 2002, losing 1-0 to Germany.

278,"Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Uruguay

URUGUAY (seeded)

How do they play?

Style & formation: As qualifying went on, coach Oscar Tabarez settled on a pragmatic and counter-attacking 4-4-2. The industrious Edinson Cavani leads the line, with Luis Suarez given licence to roam.

Tabarez, however, is not afraid to switch formations, doing so in away matches and during the Confederations Cup to counteract the opposition, including playing 3-5-2 and 4-3-3. Expect him to vary it up in Brazil.

Strengths: In Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani and the evergreen Diego Forlan, Uruguay possess magnificent striking options.

Oscar Tabarez has also reintroduced the Uruguayan characteristic 'garra' - an inner belief that they are tougher than their opponent, both technically and mentally.

Weaknesses: Diego Godin aside, part of Atletico Madrid's miserly defence, Uruguay's defensive department is ageing. Diego Lugano and midfield enforcer Edgidio Arevalo headline the over-thirties. They have worn the shirt with pride but for some Brazil very much has an end of party feel to it.

Key player

Luis Suarez, 26, is Uruguay's all-time leading scorer with 39 goals in 76 caps; he beat Diego Forlan's previous record during last year's Confederations Cup. The Liverpool forward's pace, fleet-footedness, power and control make him one of the game's most potent strikers. He may have scored three goals at the 2010 World Cup but his handball on the line in the quarter-final against Ghana is the abiding memory of him from South Africa.

He is a doubt to start the World Cup after picking up a knee injury.

One to watch

Diego Godin has always been in the shadows of his centre-back partner Diego Lugano, but not anymore. Godin became a leader of men at Atletico this season and was voted La Liga player of the month for April and May.

The boss

Oscar Tabarez demands more respect than most in Uruguay. The former teacher has revamped the youth set-up, led them to fourth at the World Cup and won a Copa America during his second spell. He has made a proud nation proud again.

World Cup record

Winners of the inaugural World Cup on home soil in 1930, they also lifted the trophy in 1950 - the only other time Brazil have hosted the tournament. Uruguay have also finished fourth on three occasions: 1954, 1970 and 2010.

Record v England

They have never lost to England at a World Cup, winning 4-2 in a 1954 quarter-final and drawing 0-0 in the group stage of England's successful 1966 campaign. Overall, they have won four and drawn three of 10 meetings but lost the most recent encounter 2-1 at Anfield in a 2006 friendly.

Fifa ranking: 7

Squad

Goalkeepers: Fernando Muslera (Galatasaray), Martin Silva (Vasco da Gama), Rodrigo Munoz (Libertad).

Midfielders: Alvaro Gonzalez (Lazio), Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo), Walter Gargano (Parma), Egidio Arevalo Rios (Morelia), Diego Perez (Bologna), Cristian Rodriguez (Atletico Madrid), Gaston Ramirez (Southampton), Nicolas Lodeiro (Botafogo).

Forwards: Luis Suarez (Liverpool), Edinson Cavani (Paris St-Germain), Abel Hernandez (Palermo), Diego Forlan (Cerezo Osaka), Christian Stuani (Espanyol).

COSTA RICA

Prospects

Arguably the most talented Costa Rica squad ever assembled for a World Cup, they can consider themselves unlucky to have been drawn in Group D. There are several European-based players among a squad that will fight tooth and nail for each other, but will that be enough?

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Costa Rica

The loss of first-choice forward Alvaro Saborio, who has scored 32 goals in 93 games for his country, just two weeks before the start of the tournament, plus the absence of Everton full-back Bryan Oviedo, is a huge blow to their chances.

Key player

Goalkeeper Keylor Navas has already reached a half century of caps at the age of 26 and he kept seven clean sheets in 14 qualifying matches. He is now first choice for Levante in Spain's top flight, with bigger clubs taking an interest.

One to watch

Defensive midfielder Yeltsin Tejeda is not just playing for Costa Rica this World Cup, he's also playing for a move, potentially to Europe. Assistant manager Paulo Wanchope, formerly of Manchester City, West Ham and Derby, believes the 21-year-old has a bright future ahead of him.

The boss

It is a second spell in charge for Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto, who was fired during qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. He has given Costa Rica an identity, given them confidence and made them difficult to break down. He has worked hard to make it to a World Cup finals and despite being drawn in a Group of Death will be optimistic of enhancing his reputation, particularly in his native Latin America.

How they qualified

They finished comfortably as runners-up in the final group stage, with their five wins all coming at home. The Ticos also only conceded seven goals in the final phase, fewer than any other team.

World Cup record

They made a winning World Cup debut against Scotland in 1990, going on to reach the last 16. Group exits have followed in 2002 and 2006.

Record v England

The two national teams have never previously met.

ENGLAND

Prospects

For once England arrive at a major tournament not weighed down by too much expectation, as the home of football takes the beautiful game to its modern day mecca. What was once perceived as being a free hit for Roy Hodgson and his squad has now turned into the quadrennial romantic notion of ""what if?"" A tough group will test England, as will the hot and sticky conditions.

Led by Roy Hodgson, the first English coach to lead England in a World Cup for 16 years, there is pressure on the Three Lions to at least continue proud traditions. Only twice before have they failed to make it out the group stage of a World Cup, in 1950 and 1958, the former of which was held in Brazil.

Wayne Rooney has scored just one goal for England in a tournament since his breakthrough Euro 2004 campaign

Key player

This will be Wayne Rooney's third World Cup and he admits the previous two have been far from successful. Nonetheless, seven goals in six qualifiers helped him nudge ever closer to Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49. England will need him at the top of his game - and to keep his cool - in Brazil.

One to watch

Leighton Baines is under pressure to perform in Brazil having seen off Ashley Cole, England's most-capped full-back, during qualifying but with 18-year-old Luke Shaw waiting in the wings. No one made more assists in qualifying for England than Baines (three) but he can not afford any defensive slips.

The boss

Roy Hodgson, 66, lost just one of his first 22 matches in charge prior to friendly defeats by Chile and Germany. This is the fourth national side he has managed after Switzerland, who he took to the last 16 at the 1994 World Cup, Finland and the United Arab Emirates. England's 13th permanent manager was appointed in May 2012. Hodgson is the first English manager with previous World Cup experience since Sir Bobby Robson in 1990.

How they qualified

England finished their qualifying campaign unbeaten and conceded just four goals. However, they left it to the last game to secure their ticket to Brazil, despite their opposition not being the strongest. Laboured draws against Ukraine, Poland and Montenegro were a tough watch.

World Cup record

Since victory in 1966, England have reached just one semi-final - in 1990. Their capitulation against Germany in 2010 was symptomatic of their struggles when pitted against top-class teams. And don't talk about penalties…

Fifa ranking: 10

Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Celtic), Ben Foster (West Bromwich Albion), Joe Hart (Manchester City).

ITALY

Prospects

Cesare Prandelli's Italy know how to make it to the latter stages of tournaments; runners-up at Euro 2012, third-place at the Confederations Cup. TThey might not be seeded but they are certainly contenders.

A possession-based team, Prandelli has selected an array of strikers to win games for him off the bench. The Azzurri's defence is based around Juventus's mean back-line, with the majestic pass-master Andrea Pirlo pulling the strings just in front of them. There is also a smattering of youth for the future.

Key player

Andrea Pirlo is still making Italy tick despite now being 35-years-of-age. Time may be passing but the master passer remains timeless. It is often said that if you stop Pirlo you stop Italy, easier said than done, especially with a team built to protect him. Pirlo (nine) played more in qualifying than any other team-mate. That says it all.

One to watch

AC Milan forward Mario Balotelli, 23, heads to the World Cup as a maturing performer. He inspired Italy to the Euro 2012 final, scoring twice in the semi-final against Germany, and top scored in qualifying with five goals. Balotelli has managed 12 goals in 30 appearances - and Italy have never lost when he has scored.

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Italy

The boss

Cesare Prandelli is well respected by all in Italian football. Tactically astute, he has hard-line views on behaviour, both on and off the pitch. However, he has relaxed the rules on social media for the World Cup: ""to allow the players maximum freedom to express themselves"".

He signed a new two-year contract in March and if he sees out the contract would become the longest-serving Italian coach since Enzo Bearzot (1975-86), the man who led the Azzurri to 1982 World Cup glory. The Italian Football Federation has faith that Prandelli can repeat the feat.

How they qualified

Arguably too easily. Italy qualified with two matches to spare, along with the Netherlands becoming the first European nation to book their place. Prandelli experimented for the final two matches - both games were drawn, crucial ranking points were dropped, and Italy's seeding hopes dashed.

World Cup record

Italy are four-time world champions (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006); only Brazil (five wins) have won more. The two-time runnersup have reached eight semi-finals in 19 previous World Cups. However, the Azzurri went home without a win to their name when defending champions four years ago.

Record v England

Italy have taken the spoils when it's mattered most in tournament football, winning their Euro 2012 quarter-final on penalties and the third-place play-off at the 1990 World Cup. The overall record is tight from 24 previous meetings, Italy ahead by nine wins to eight.

Fifa ranking: 9

Squad

Goalkeepers: Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus), Salvatore Sirigu (Paris St-Germain), Mattia Perin (Genoa).

279,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Belgium 2-1 Algeria

Goals from Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens saw Belgium come from behind to beat Algeria in their World Cup Group H opener in Belo Horizonte.

The north African side took a shock lead when Sofiane Feghouli scored from the spot after being fouled by Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen.

Manchester United's Fellaini, a second-half substitute, equalised with a looping header shortly after coming on.

And Mertens scored the winner when he finished off a swift counter-attack.

The 80th-minute strike prompted an eruption of relief from the Belgium bench, not least from coach Marc Wilmots, who had spent most of the match looking understandably pensive.

Match facts Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku failed to register a single touch in the opposition area

Algeria ended a run of 506 minutes without a goal at the World Cup finals

Thibaut Courtois is yet to lose a match he has played for Belgium (W11 D7) and has kept 10 clean sheets in 18 games

His side had 65% possession but for most of the game found it difficult to penetrate an Algeria defence marshalled by former Rangers centre-half Madjid Bougherra.

The European side, the seeded team in the group and widely tipped to do well in Brazil after an impressive qualifying campaign, fielded an imposing starting XI, with the Chelsea pair of Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku in attack, while Spurs' Mousa Dembele and former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne sat in midfield.

Pre-tournament fifth favourites with some bookmakers, they looked anything but for 69 minutes.

They were rocked in the 24th minute when forward Feghouli was hauled down by Vertonghen in the area as he aimed to convert Faouzi Ghoulam's cross.

The Valencia player recovered to sidefoot a tame penalty past another Blues player Thibaut Courtois, who dived the wrong way. That was Algeria's first World Cup goal since 1986 - 506 minutes of football.

Belgium's best early chances were from long distance and fell to Zenit St Petersburg's Axel Witsel, who had two efforts saved before failing to convert a header.

Match analysis ""It was a massive win for Belgium. My only concern is, centre-forward wise, do they have one to fire them to the semi-final? I'm not sure they do.""

The pattern changed with the Belgium substitutions. First to test the goal was 19-year-old Lille striker Divock Origi, who forced a brilliant low save from Rais Mbolhi.

Gaps began to grow in a tiring Algeria defence, and a fresh Fellaini took advantage of that when he outmuscled marker Carl Medjani and flicked his effort beyond the reach of Mbolhi.

The winner came from a move that showed off Belgium's attack at its best.

De Bruyne tackled Feghouli in his own half and when the ball found its way to Hazard on the left, the PFA young player of the year sped down the wing and fed Mertens, who slammed his shot high into the net.

Belgium almost grabbed a third through Fellaini, but Mbolhi produced another good save from point-blank range.

Belgium coach Marc Wilmots:

""It was a tough match but we were patient throughout and at the end we were rewarded.

""We stayed calm after doing a small mistake in the first half. We got a new momentum. We saw that Algeria were getting more and more tired. At half-time people were a bit down, but I said 'don't worry, we will score and we will change totally the match'.""

Algeria coach Vahid Halilhodzic:

""It's a major disappointment. I would have liked to have a couple of tougher and more resilient players to resist their attacks but I don't have much of a choice.

""We missed a great opportunity here. But in the second half it was a bit tough. We left too much space to the Belgian team and the two goals scored against us were to be expected.""

Tottenham defender Vertonghen protested against the card and penalty decision in Estadio Mineirao

Feghouli ended Algeria's barren World Cup run in the 24th minute

Story of the match:

Brazil denied by Ochoa brilliance

Scolari's men disappoint in second Group A game

Both sides on four points

Brazil unbeaten in 39 successive matches in own country

Brazil produced an unconvincing display as Mexico held them to a goalless draw with an outstanding performance by goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's side were again well short of their best in a cauldron of an atmosphere at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza.

Match analysis ""Brazil played against a good Mexico side. On several occasions Guillermo Ochoa showed lightning quick reactions - as a single individual he was definitely man of the match. ""It's not the end of the world for Brazil, and they created good chances. ""The real disappointment for me was Fred. The comer flag moved better than he did. Jo was much better. ""We shouldn't judge Jo just on what he did in England with Manchester City. But Fred is one of those players who can come back.""

Neymar and captain Thiago Silva had the best of Brazil's chances but were denied by Ochoa.

Mexico more than held their own, testing home keeper Julio Cesar through substitute Raul Jiminez and peppering his goal in a breathless second half.

The result leaves both sides with a chance of topping Group A. Brazil face Cameroon in Brasilia in their final match, knowing a point will be enough to see them through.

This was a game in which the hosts' reliance on the brilliance of Neymar and Oscar was exposed. Fred failed to appease his critics with a toothless display in attack, while Paulinho and Luiz Gustavo lacked imagination in midfield.

It is not the first time Brazil have struggled against Mexico - no team has beaten them more often in the 21st century - and they were fortunate not to lose again.

Ochoa, who has left French club Ajaccio, was in exceptional form

Neymar was in the thick of the action from the off, dancing away from Mexico defenders, and drawing several fouls.

And it was the Barcelona striker who had the best of the early chances. From Dani Alves' cross he rose high at the back post to head powerfully towards goal. Ochoa threw himself to his right to tip the ball to safety.

In Brazil the save was compared to Gordon Banks' famous dive to keep out Pele's header in the 1970 World Cup.

Ochoa made another vital save with half-time approaching, spreading himself to smother a close-range stab by Paulinho, after Silva chested on a free-kick.

But Mexico gave every bit as good as they got.

Match facts Brazil's Fred only completed eight of his 16 passes against Mexico

Only two of Brazil's last 26 World Cup games have ended goalless

Brazil had won their three previous World Cup meetings with Mexico, by a combined score of 11-0

Ochoa made six saves in this game. No keeper has made more in a game in this World Cup so far (Rais M'bolhi of Algeria also made six saves, against Belgium)

Oribe Peralta led wave after wave of Mexico attacks, but it was Hector Herrera and Jose Juan Vazquez who went closest before the interval with piercing shots from distance, one of which Cesar tipped over, while the other whistled just wide.

Though Brazil remained short of their fluent best, the introduction of Bernard for Ramires at half-time added zip to their attack.

Neymar curled a free-kick wide and went closer still as he chested down Bernard's cross and drilled a fierce low shot at goal, only for Ochoa to deny him once more.

Former Manchester City striker Jo, on as a substitute, dragged a shot wide as Brazil became increasingly desperate for a goal.

Andres Guardado fizzed a shot just over Cesar's crossbar, while the Brazil goalkeeper had to react quickly to turn away a thunderous low shot from substitute Jiminez. Mexico finished the game with purpose and belief. Brazil must do better.

281,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Russia 1-1 South Korea

Former England coach Fabio Capello saw his Russia side come from behind to draw with South Korea in Group H thanks to a goal by Aleksandr Kerzhakov.

The substitute drove the ball home to join Vladimir Beschastnykh as Russia's all-time top scorer with 26 goals.

South Korea had led through a long-range shot from Lee Keun-ho that squirmed through the hands of goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.

Belgium top the group after their earlier win over Algeria.

Analysis ""Russia did not react until the 68th minute when they went a goal down. All of sudden they went two up front and were an attacking force. ""Russia's Akinfeev was struggling holding onto everything all night. That goal from South Korea is schoolboy. For someone who has 70 caps for Russia, that may be his last.""

The late excitement in Cuiaba was in stark contrast to much of what had gone before.

South Korea had been marginally the more inventive side, although they needed a significant amount of luck to take the lead as the edgy Akinfeev gifted them the opening goal.

But the substitutions by Capello - who led England to the last 16 in 2010 - proved crucial for Russia, looking to build a platform from which to advance to the knockout stages for the first time since the Soviet Union reached the second phase in 1986.

Son Heung-min had Korea's best two chances of the first half, linking well with Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young on both occasions. But he failed to hit the target with either chance, while captain Koo Ja-cheol saw a deflected shot fly just wide.

Russia had been limited to long-range efforts, Sergey Ignashevich's free-kick forcing Jung Sung-ryong into an unconvincing save.

Neither goalkeeper inspired much confidence and after Jung had tipped a shot from Victor Fayzulin over the bar in the first minute of the second half, captain Vasily Berezoutski headed into the side netting from the resulting corner.

Match facts Including games as the Soviet Union, this was Russia's first draw in 12 World Cup games

This was the first time in four World Cups that South Korea haven't started with a win

Russia's last eight goals in the World Cup have all come after half-time

South Korea have won only two of their last 11 World Cup games

The sides then traded speculative shots and Akinfeev struggled to keep out a free-kick from Kim Young-Gwon.

But that was nothing compared with the error he made on 68 minutes, when he allowed a 25-yard head-height shot from substitute Lee to slip through his hands and into the net.

Russia, however, had been showing more urgency since the introduction of Alan Dzagoev, and a second Capello substitution paid off almost immediately.

Kerzhakov, the 31-year-old Zenit St Petersburg forward and record goalscorer in Russian domestic football, had been on the field for just three minutes when he struck to earn a deserved point on the eve of the Italian's 68th birthday.

Dzagoev's low shot was well saved but South Korea could not clear and when the ball cannoned into Kerzhakov, he showed the necessary composure to fire home a right-footed shot from six yards out.

Russia saw the chance to press for a winner and Alexander Kokorin went close with two headers before Aleksandr Samedov fired well wide in stoppage time.

Russia boss Fabio Capello told BBC Sport:

""It was a good game, they ran a lot in the first half and then felt tired. You saw the goal they scored, it was not easy to react.

""But the players were really good and most important for me was the reaction. We also twice had a chance to score a second goal.

""I know Kerzhakov did well, he's a fantastic player. He always offers us a way to score goals.""

South Korea coach Hong Myung-bosaid:

""In such a tournament, the first match is the most difficult. There is a lot of pressure on it, so I thought the players played very well.

""I think our players really did their utmost on the pitch today. Tactically and physically, each and every moment they played intelligently.

""We focused our rhythm and organisation on this match. I think it worked well. The condition of players and organisation of the team was good.""

282,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Australia 2-3 Netherlands

Netherlands secured a last-16 place in the 2014 Fifa World Cup as Memphis Depay gave them victory over Australia, who are out of the tournament.

Arjen Robben angled in a shot to put the Dutch ahead, but Tim Cahill soon equalised with a stunning volley.

Mile Jedinak slotted in a penalty for Australia before Robin van Persie lashed home to level it at 2-2.

Mathew Leckie then missed a chance for the Socceroos, and Depay sent in a 25-yard shot for the winner.

Analysis ""Australia are the lowest ranked team here but it was a heroic effort, an incredible goal by Tim Cahill and they should have won the game. That minute cost them with Mathew Leckie missing the chance at one end and the goalkeeper's mistake at the other. What a game, what a World Cup.""

Netherlands demolished holders Spain in their opening game and, though they came nowhere near those heights, they had enough to overcome a bold Australia at the imposing Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre.

Progress to the last 16 was secured after holders Spain were beaten by Chile, who join the Dutch on six points in the group.

Having lost to Chile in their first match, Australia's hopes of reaching the next round are over, but their youthful side certainly gave Netherlands a scare.

Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou said before the game his side intended to attack - and they were true to his words in the opening exchanges.

But a flash of quality from Robben saw the Netherlands take the lead against the run of play. The Bayern Munich forward feinted his way past Alex Wilkinson on the halfway line, raced towards the Australia goal and drove in an angled shot for his third goal of the World Cup.

The Socceroos responded immediately with one of the goals of the tournament so far, Cahill meeting an angled ball from the right with a powerful left-foot volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

Had midfielder Mark Bresciano and defender Matthew Spiranovic shown the same poise, Australia could have taken the lead earlier than they did.

Key facts Arjen Robben has scored eight goals in his past eight games for the Netherlands, and four in his past four World Cup games.

Tim Cahill has netted three goals in his past three World Cup games.

Robin van Persie only completed one pass (out of four attempted) in the first half.

Bresciano ran onto a low Leckie cross only to shoot over from just inside the area, while Spiranovic got away from his marker at a free-kick but side-footed an eight-yard shot straight at keeper Jasper Cillessen.

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal had complained about his view from the dugout before the match - and much of what he saw is not likely to have pleased him, especially defensively.

Cahill and Van Persie were both ruled out of their teams' final group games after being shown their second yellow cards of the tournament, either side of Leckie having a goal disallowed after he was adjudged to have fouled Daley Blind.

But Australia continued to press, and went in front when an Oliver Bozanic cross struck the hand of Daryl Janmaat and Jedinak slotted home from the spot.

The lead did not last long, though, as Van Persie netted his 11th goal in 10 internationals, controlling the ball before turning and firing into the roof of the net.

Australia again opened up the Dutch and Tommy Oar crossed for Leckie, who chested rather than headed the ball straight at Cillessen.

But it was Depay who decided the outcome of the game, the 20-year-old PSV Eindhoven winger curling a shot beyond the reach of Mat Ryan to give Netherlands their first victory in four games against Australia.

Australian coach Ange Postecoglou:

""I just wanted the players to get the reward for the way they went about things today.

""I have put a lot of pressure on the players and the staff that we are going to be a certain type of team and take it to world-class opposition, but it is one thing saying it and another thing doing it.

""They did that today but didn't get their reward. It's heartbreaking and massively disappointing.""

Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal:

""If in the first half you lose the ball so simply or so often, then the formation doesn't matter. I needed to change something at half-time to boost their confidence and change their mindset.

""Fortunately it turned out OK, but it could have turned out differently. In the second half we had more chances and the way the players came from behind was incredible. To recover and correct that situation showed a lot of mental strength.""

284,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Cameroon 0-4 Croatia

Cameroon failed to progress beyond the World Cup group stage once again as they slumped to defeat against Croatia.

The African side fell behind in the 11th minute as Ivica Olic fired home, and were reduced to 10 men after Alex Song lashed out at Mario Mandzukic.

Match analysis ""I was in Cameroon when the team qualified for the World Cup. ""There was so much joy and hope, that after failing to qualify for two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, they had finally turned the corner. ""It won't be the defeat that hurts the most, it'll be the way the team has played. Too defensive, too cautious, too afraid. The antithesis of what made Cameroon perhaps Africa's most famous football nation.""

Ivan Perisic made it 2-0 when he punished goalkeeper Charles Itandje's poor clearance, before Mandzukic headed home Croatia's third.

Mandzukic added his second, tapping in after Eduardo's shot was parried.

Niko Kovac's side now face Mexico in their final Group A game knowing victory would assure them of a place in the last 16 for the first time in four attempts.

But Cameroon have failed to reach the second round for their fifth successive World Cup.

They looked rudderless without injured captain Samuel Eto'o, and their task became more difficult when Song lost his cool five minutes before the break.

The Barcelona midfielder inexplicably lashed out at Mandzukic's back as he tracked the Croatia striker, and referee Pedro Proenca had no hesitation in showing him a red card.

Cameroon were already a goal down, with Olic having tapped in after a lovely pass from the impressive Perisic.

Media playback is not supported on this device Cameroon players bust-up after Croatia defeat

Wolfsburg midfielder Perisic, who has been linked with Everton, then went close with a header before he doubled Croatia's advantage with a excellent run and finish after Itandje found him with a poor kick.

Mandzukic, who was suspended for Croatia's opening game, then showed his aerial prowess by netting a powerful header following Danijel Pranjic's corner.

And the Bayern Munich striker completed the rout with an easy tap-in after the nervy Itandje could only push substitute Eduardo's tame shot into his path.

Cameroon's best attempt came in the dying seconds, when substitute Pierre Webo's header forced Stipe Pletikosa to save brilliantly.

And there was still time for the four-time African champions' full-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto to thrust his head at team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo during an argument in stoppage time.

Cameroon still have to face hosts Brazil, and will have to improve markedly in both performance and discipline if they are to avoid another embarrassment.

""Perth has never been recognised as being a football city and that has to be seen as being correct,"" Brown said.

""But I would hope this occasion will give it a wee bit of stirring.

""Our first game at home next season is going to be a European tie and we have Dundee coming up, so I hope season tickets would be boosted.""

Brown was speaking to BBC Scotland during an open-top bus parade in Perth to celebrate Saints' 2-0 Cup final triumph over Dundee United.

Around 15,000 St Johnstone fans were at Celtic Park for what was the club's first Scottish Cup final in their 130-year history.

And Brown, who stepped down as chairman in 2011 following 25 years at the helm, was thrilled with how far Saints have come, having taken over during a period of financial turmoil.

It means so much to my dad, and to Perth, it's an enormous occasion. It's phenomenal St Johnstone chairman Steve Brown

""Away back in 1986, in the first game we go bottom of the Second Division and we said there's only one way we can go, and that is up,"" Brown added.

""We're very very pleased that for the last five years we've been going quite well and we're now recognised as a club that can be there.

""Yesterday, Dundee United were favourites but in my eyes I don't believe they should have ever been favourites, and our players proved that, which is great.

""That was probably the largest gathering of Perth people ever, and that's a great achievement.""

Brown passed control of the club on to his son Steve, and he was delighted with the huge turnout for the victory parade.

""Its phenomenal, absolutely brilliant to see what it means to Perth with all these people lining the streets,"" said the current chairman.

""We shed a few tears after the final whistle and I spoke to the players after the game, and it was difficult not to break down. It means so much to my dad, and to Perth; it's an enormous occasion.

""We went under the radar and that probably suits us. I'd like to think we're far more established than we were even five or 10 years ago.

Motherwell and St Johnstone enter the Europa League in qualifying round two, with the first legs on 17 July.

The draws for both competitions will be held on 23 June.

Celtic's Ambrose, Forster, Samaras and Izaguirre are heading for the World Cup finals

Those early rounds, which have been confirmed by organising body Uefa, will present a particular challenge for Celtic manager Neil Lennon, whose side are in the Champions League after securing their third successive Scottish league title.

Lennon will be scouting for new talent at the World Cup finals, but time is not on his side should he wish to sign his targets - and have them fit and available - for the qualifiers.

Meanwhile, the Scottish champions' goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, is in England's squad for the World Cup finals, while defender Efe Ambrose is with Nigeria, left-back Emilio Izaguirre is with Honduras and midfielder Tom Rogic is heading to Brazil with Australia.

Forward Georgios Samaras has been named in the Greece squad but will not be returning to Celtic after the World Cup as he was not offered a new deal at the end of his current contract.

Aberdeen became the earliest starters among Scotland's four representatives this season after a final-day defeat at home by Motherwell meant they finished the season third in the Scottish Premiership.

The hosts are one of the favourites for the tournament and boast an 11-year unbeaten record on home soil, but Brazil will be looking to banish memories of hosting the 1950 World Cup, when they were beaten by Uruguay in the final game.

The flicks and tricks remain second nature, but this Brazil side is also resilient and well organised, moulded by the pragmatism of 2002 World Cup winning-coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.

Scolari has the required major tournament know-how, the players are talented and well-drilled, a passionate home crowd will surely inspire the team and even the iconic yellow jerseys can intimidate the opposition.

Croatia

Semi-finalists at the 1998 World Cup in France, Croatia have struggled on football's biggest stage ever since and only just qualified for Brazil by beating minnows Iceland in a play-off.

Mario Mandzukic, 28, averaged better than a goal every other game in 2013, helping Bayern Munich win a historic treble and top scoring for Croatia with four goals in qualifying. The goals have dried up recently, though, registering just twice in his last 11 appearances.

Bayern coach Pep Guardiola says ""there is nobody better in the air in the world"" than the striker, but his red card for a studs-up lunge in the play-off win over Iceland will limit his World Cup involvement.

Mexico

Mexico used 47 players and four coaches in a turbulent qualifying campaign which left a host of questions unanswered.

There is undoubtedly talent within their playing pool, but the 2012 Olympic gold medallists have little time left to find a winning formula.

Only a late comeback from the USA against Panama saved El Tri from elimination in the final round of Concacaf qualifiers. That set up a two-legged tie against New Zealand, which they won 9-3 on aggregate.

The Swiss have several talented youngsters coming through from the sides that won the Under-17 World Cup in 2007 and reached the final at the 2011 European Under-21 Championship.

Switzerland's perfectly-timed rise to become one of the seeded nations for the World Cup is founded on a resilient defence, with two central midfielders shielding the back four.

A record of nine clean sheets in Switzerland's last 15 matches - including in a 1-0 win over Brazil - is testament to the strength of their aforementioned defence.

Ecuador

During qualifying Ecuador only dropped two points at home, against Argentina, but failed to win a single away game taking just three points from those eight matches.

There's no doubting Ecuador have talented attacking players but there is a lack of top-class defenders. Their results away from Quito, the altitude sickness-inducing capital, do not bode well either.

They only dropped two points at home, against Argentina, but failed to win a single away qualifier, taking just three points from those eight games.

France

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: France

At the last four World Cups France have either failed to win a game (2002, 2010) or reach the final (1998, 2006).

That Jekyll and Hyde streak remains. Daily sports newspaper L'Equipe asked ""is this the worst French team in history?"" after a first leg defeat in their play-off with Ukraine.

The headline which then followed a rousing second-leg comeback read simply: ""Respect.""

Honduras

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Honduras

Honduras have qualified for back-to-back World Cups for the first time in their history but are yet to win a match in their two previous appearances, in 1982 and 2010.

The squad lacks real pedigree, and they are one of the tournament's outsiders.

Their lack of technical ability could be partly compensated for by familiarity with the hot and humid conditions expected in parts of Brazil.

Argentina

Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Argentina

Argentina pose one of the greatest attacking threats in the tournament, with the likes of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero.

They often fielded a bold 4-3-3 formation in qualifying, although a more conservative 5-3-2 was deployed for tricky away fixtures.

But with Angel Di Maria deployed as part of a midfield three, the formation offers little defensive protection.

Bosnia-Hercegovina

Media playback is not supported on this device Team Profile: Bosnia-Hercegovina

Despite being the only World Cup debutants, Bosnia are odds-on with most bookies to reach the last 16 thanks to their attacking firepower and technical ability. Their cavalier tactics in qualifying - a 4-4-2 diamond - yielded 30 goals, 18 from strike duo Edin Dzeko and Vedad Ibisevic.

While the squad is overflowing with playmakers, it lacks effective ball-winners to screen the defence.

Expect them to change formation against Argentina but go for the jugular against Nigeria and Iran.

Iran

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Iran

This is Iran's fourth World Cup finals and they are yet to compete in the knockout stages. They will hope the attacking threat of Fulham midfielder Ashkan Dejagah and veteran captain Javad Nekounam gets them out of the groups this time.

A predominantly domestic-based squad will do well to improve on Iran's World Cup record of one win in nine attempts.

They only conceded twice in eight matches during the final qualifying phase but stronger opponents lie ahead.

Nigeria

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Nigeria

Nigeria qualified top of their qualification group before convincingly beating Ethiopia 4-1 in a play-off. Relying on their strength at the back with captain and goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, they also have striking flair with forwards Victor Moses and Peter Odemwingie.

After failing to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, the Super Eagles have undergone a radical transformation under Steven Keshi, who has sought to lower the average age of the squad.

His selection policy, at times controversial, has paid off - this year the Super Eagles won their first African title since 1994. They produced a competent showing at the Confederations Cup, but improvement is needed to reach the knockout stages in 2014.

Group G

Germany

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Germany

The three-time World Cup winners topped their group in qualifying scoring 36 goals in the process.

Blessed with far more flair than many Germany sides of the past, their fluid 4-2-3-1 is underpinned by Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira anchoring the side from the base of midfield.

Ahead of them lies creative fulcrum Mesut Ozil, who is usually flanked by the dangerous Marco Reus and Thomas Muller.

Portugal

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Portugal

Cristiano Ronaldo's four goals over two legs in their play-off match against Sweden booked Portugal's place in Brazil.

With Ronaldo in your team, the sky's the limit. However, getting out of a very tricky group will be their primary objective before they can start thinking of a potential quarter-final against Argentina.

The likes of Pepe and Joao Moutinho give them a strong spine, but they remain without a world-class striker, meaning the goalscoring burden rests with Ronaldo.

Ghana

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: Ghana

The Black Stars were fancied to repeat, or even improve on, their run to the quarter-finals in 2010 in Brazil. That was until the draw was made and they were pitted with the world's second and third-ranked sides.

However, confidence is not an issue in the Ghana camp and why should it be? Their team is packed with experience and world-class talent. Michael Essien's return has been crucial, while Asamoah Gyan's time in the Middle East hasn't blunted his goalscoring touch.

United States

Media playback is not supported on this device Team profile: USA

USA topped their group in qualifying to secure their seventh successive appearance at the World Cup finals.

Head coach Jurgen Klinsmann says the minimum aim is to reach the knockout stage. A national record 16 wins in 2013 - including against a depleted Germany - gives cause for confidence.

Defence is a concern and then there's the lack of continuity - 37 players were used in qualifying.

Group H

Belgium

Despite being in a tricky group, Belgium qualified for their first finals since 2002 after remaining unbeaten during their qualifying campaign.

Belgium gave a series of controlled and powerful displays throughout qualifying. Disciplined defensively, they are prepared to be patient but look to break with pace.

They have an abundance of versatile attacking players and, crucially, a tight-knit team spirit instilled by coach Marc Wilmots.

Algeria

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: Algeria

Write off Algeria at your peril. No longer World Cup whipping boys, the Desert Foxes are boosted by a stronger professional league, improving standards at grassroots level and an influx of players with Algerian parents or ancestry.

Zinedine Zidane, Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri have all previously slipped through Algeria's net. The Greens will be hoping they have turned off that particular tap that has been flowing in the direction of France, and with it enhanced their own standing in world football.

World Cup stars of yesteryear Diego Maradona and Rivaldo, as well as Javier Zanetti, have been queuing up to sing the virtues of the Greens' class of 2014 - the only Arab nation present in Brazil. Maradona predicts Algeria ""will cause a surprise"", while Rivaldo says ""the possibilities of reaching the second round are abundant"".

Russia

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup team profile: Russia

Fabio Capello and Russia work to each other's strengths. Of their potential starters at the World Cup, nine boast 40 caps or more. The miserly back-line predominantly come from CSKA Moscow, while perennial Champions League dark horses Zenit St Petersburg provide the rest of the spine.

For the most part, Capello only calls up Russian-based players so he has got to know his squad and their strengths quickly.

The midfield is key to them playing high-tempo, pressing football. Yet their Achilles heel can be when they are subjected to a similar style themselves.

South Korea

Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2014 team profile: South Korea

When South Korea and Japan were awarded the 2002 World Cup as co-hosts it was with a view to spreading the football gospel. To provide better coaching, facilities and infrastructure not only for both countries but for Asian football as a whole.

South Korea certainly embraced the gift given to them by Fifa. Their coach Hong Myung-bo was part of Dutchman Guus Hiddink's fourth-placed finishers at that tournament. Two further Dutch coaches followed, as did several South Korean playing exports to western European club sides.

Once seen as whipping boys, the Taeguk Warriors are anything but these days and are seen as genuine challengers to qualify.

290,"BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is predicting the outcome of every game at the 2014 Fifa World Cup.

The second round of group games include must-win matches for England, against Uruguay, and Spain, who face Chile, after both teams suffered defeats in their opening fixtures.

Brazil and Mexico are the first teams to play their second game, on the same day as the opening fixtures in Group H. Those results are also included in Lawro's predictions.

Before the tournament, Lawro picked his two teams to go through from each group and reach the knockout stage.

He is backing Argentina to win the World Cup and lift the trophy at the Maracana on 13 July, and believes England will reach the quarter-finals.

Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

291,"Thirty-two teams, 64 games, 31 days and one prize - the World Cup is here.

The tournament gets under way in Sao Paulo on Thursday with hosts Brazil facing Croatia, while England get their campaign up and running against Italy on Saturday.

Only one side can lift the trophy in Rio on Sunday 13 July, but who are the teams to watch?

Match of the Day presenter and former England captain Gary Lineker - who will be doing a video blog during the tournament for the BBC Sport website - guides you through the eight groups.

Group A

Brazil, Croatia, Mexico, Cameroon

Media playback is not supported on this device Lineker's World Cup guides: Group A

Lineker's verdict:

""Brazil have been given a group that is tricky but not terrifying.

""This is not the best Mexican team we've seen - they only just qualified through the play-offs and they normally cruise through. Cameroon don't seem confident that they can do much and Croatia are a decent European side. We know all about Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric and they will be hard to beat.

""Brazil will dominate, but who will go through with them? It will go down to the last match between Croatia and Mexico, but I'm backing Croatia.""

Group B

Spain, Netherlands, Chile, Australia

Media playback is not supported on this device Lineker's World Cup guides: Group B

Lineker's verdict:

""Group B is fascinating - a very strong group indeed - with the opening fixture a repeat of the 2010 final between Spain and the Netherlands.

""Four years ago the Dutch went against their instincts and tried to kick Spain off the park, but under Louis van Gaal they will surely go back to their normal style.

""Chile play some beautiful possession football but Spain are arguably even stronger than in their last three major tournaments - which they won - as they have a striker now in Diego Costa who has been a revelation for Atletico Madrid.

""Spain will win the group and I'll back Van Gaal to get the Netherlands through.""

Group C

Colombia, Greece, Ivory Coast, Japan

Lineker's verdict:

""A tight group and difficult to predict.

""Colombia are very technical and keep the ball while the Ivory Coast have produced some of the world's finest players. Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba are world class but the team lack depth. They can cause problems though.

""Japan are growing in stature all the time - they've come a long way since I played there in the early 1990s - and they will be able to cause a few upsets. I don't fancy Greece at all.

""Yaya Toure might pull it out of the bag for the Ivory Coast and they will join Colombia in the second round.""

Group D

Uruguay, England, Italy, Costa Rica

Media playback is not supported on this device Lineker's World Cup guides: Group D

Lineker's verdict:

""I don't share the nation's fear of this group - it could have been so much worse. England are up against a slightly ageing Italian side and a Uruguayan side who are very dependent on a front three of Luis Suarez, Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani.

""If you can contain them, the rest of that team are pretty weak. Costa Rica aren't too bad and could take a few points off the other teams.

""England and Italy are both notorious for starting major tournaments slowly and I wouldn't be surprised if the opener in Manaus was a draw.

""I'm confident that England will go through and I'll go with Italy to join them.""

Group E

Switzerland, France, Honduras, Ecuador

Media playback is not supported on this device Lineker's World Cup Group Guides - E

Lineker's verdict:

""The French have been given a really good draw. If you can afford to leave players out like Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, then you must be in pretty good shape. But it's about whether they can score enough goals.

""They've got Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema - he's clearly a lovely, gifted footballer who scores brilliant goals, but for a centre-forward I'd like to see him get into the box a bit more. I'm not sure if he's absolutely top drawer. You have to expect the French to go through as group winners.

""You can't fancy Honduras as the other qualifier, while Ecuador do well when they play at altitude at home, but they won't have that advantage in Brazil. So I'm going to go for Switzerland, who are organised and have one or two good players coming through.""

Fixtures: Sunday 15 June: Switzerland v Ecuador 17:00, France v Honduras 20:00, Friday 20 June: Switzerland v France 20:00, Honduras v Ecuador 23:00, Wednesday 25 June: Honduras v Switzerland, Ecuador v France 21:00.

Argentina, Bosnia, Nigeria, Iran

Lineker's verdict:

""This group features one of the favourites - Argentina, who will take some stopping. History tells us that South American teams win the World Cup when it's staged on their continent. Argentina have the greatest player I think we've seen in many a year - Barcelona's Lionel Messi.

""He'll be massively keen to win a World Cup. Former player Diego Maradona did it at a similar age and I think Messi's been saving himself during the Spanish season.

""Bosnia-Hercegovina qualified well. Their Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko might be an outside bet for the Golden Boot. Then there's Nigeria, who won the Africa Cup of Nations - they probably have to be favourites with regards to the African team that will go the furthest. You can't give much hope for Iran. I think it'll be Argentina to win the group and Nigeria to go through too.""

Lineker's verdict:

""This is probably the most open group in the tournament - because you can make a case for all four teams. Germany have some fresh produce coming through - I expect them to be strong. Ghana don't have too many household names, but they have very good players and are well organised.

""Portugal have Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, of course - he's been brilliant this season and won the World Player of the Year award. He has a phenomenal goalscoring record and almost single-handedly took Portugal to the World Cup when his hat-trick helped see off Sweden in the play-offs. Teams will gang up on Ronaldo though.

""You can make a case for the USA - Jurgen Klinsmann is a wily coach and they've recently had some good results in internationals. But I'm going to go for Germany to win the group and for Portugal to finish second.""

Fixtures: Monday 16 June: Germany v Portugal 17:00, Ghana v USA 23:00, Saturday 21 June: Germany v Ghana 20:00, Sunday 22 June: USA v Portugal 23:00, Thursday 26 June: USA v Germany, Portugal v Ghana both 17:00.

Group H

Belgium, Algeria, Russia, South Korea

Media playback is not supported on this device Lineker's World Cup guides: Group H

Lineker's verdict:

""It's not the most exhilarating-looking group, unless you look a little deeper. Belgium are the obvious favourites. To a man, people are saying they are dark horses, but if everyone is saying it how can they be a dark horse?

""They have three world-class players in Atletico Madrid's on-loan keeper Thibaut Courtois, Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany and Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard. They are very strong defensively and have firepower. To go through with them? It's a tough call.

""Russia have Fabio Capello in charge - he frankly messed up four years ago in South Africa while coaching England. There's also Algeria and South Korea in the group. Here's something... Algeria are priced about 12-1 to be the African team to go the furthest - it could be worth a punt at those sort of odds. Having said all that, I'm saying Belgium to win the group, with Russia second.""

Fixtures: Tuesday 17 June: Belgium v Algeria 17:00, Russia v South Korea 23:00, Sunday 22 June: Belgium v Russia 17:00, South Korea v Algeria 20:00, Thursday 26 June: South Korea v Belgium, Algeria v Russia both 21:00.

292,"Manchester City will be allowed a 21-man squad in next season's Champions League

Manchester City will be required to name only five home-grown players in a reduced 21-man squad for next season's Champions League.

City were hit with restrictions on their European squad in May, after breaching financial fair play rules.

The club had been due to name eight home-grown players but Uefa has bowed to pressure from players' union FIFPro.

Uefa said it was ""appropriate"" to reduce the number of home-grown players present in the smaller squad.

Gianni Infantino, Uefa's general secretary, said: ""It came after a request from the players union FIFPro saying when you take these kind of sanctions and measures you cannot harm the players - and the rights of a player who has a contract - for the behaviour of the clubs.

What is financial fair play? • The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) was set up in June 2012 to oversee the application of the Uefa Club Licensing System and Financial Fair Play Regulations • Clubs cannot repeatedly spend more than their generated revenues, and clubs will be obliged to meet all their transfer and employee payment commitments at all times • Higher-risk clubs that fail certain indicators will also be required to provide budgets detailing their strategic plans • Teams participating in Uefa club competitions have had their transfer and employee payables monitored since the summer of 2011. The break-even assessment covering the financial years ending 2012 and 2013 will be assessed during 2013-14 Read more at Uefa.com

""So we looked at it and it was felt appropriate there for the number to be proportionally reduced as well.""

In addition to the squad restrictions, City were fined £49m - £32m of which is suspended - after being named as one of nine clubs to fall foul of Uefa's financial fair play rules.

The Premier League champions can spend just £49m on players this summer, plus any money the receive in transfer fees. City's wage bill for 2014-15 must stay the same as last season.

During last season's Champions League campaign, City registered 23 players because of the eight home-grown players rule, using 21.

The reduction in the home-grown players limit means City should be able to cope with the expected departure of Joleon Lescott, with Micah Richards and James Milner also being linked with a move.

England goalkeeper Joe Hart, midfielder Jack Rodwell, left-back Gael Clichy and defender Dedryck Boyata were also named as home-grown players in last season's Champions League squad.

UEFA defines home-grown players as those who, regardless of their nationality, have been trained by their club - or by another club in the same national association - for at least three years between the age of 15 and 21. Half of those players must have had that training with their current club.",Champions League: Man City home-grown quota cut by Uefa,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75456000/jpg/_75456088_mancity.jpg,2014-06-11 15:17:19,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27798163

Yes, he made Sturridge's goal and he did his best for the team, but being wide is not his best position. England have got other players who are more effective there.

The question I would ask England manager Roy Hodgson - is Wayne a left or right-sided midfielder? And the answer is no.

What now for Wayne Rooney?

Analysis ""Wayne Rooney will want to get his name up there alongside the big players at this tournament. ""There is an inner determination with Wayne, he has a deep drive inside him and will want to come away having stamped his name on the World Cup with goals and assists.""

So, what to do with Wayne Rooney is now England manager Roy Hodgson's big dilemma at this World Cup. Hodgson has a decision to make.

Because of how well they played against Italy, Raheem Sterling and Sturridge have to start against Uruguay in a game England need to win. You cannot leave either of them out.

Sterling excelled in that number 10 role but that does not mean there is no place for Rooney, though.

I would have him in behind Sturridge, where he has proven himself time and time again, and move Sterling to the right, where he plays for Liverpool the vast majority of the time.

But either play Rooney off the striker, or do not play him at all.

Hodgson felt Rooney played well last night when he was on the left in the first half. If that was the case, why did he swap him over to the right for the second half?

Rooney was unhappy and uncomfortable out there and I understand why. We should not be playing our top goalscorer out of position. Put him where he can do some damage.

He has got 39 goals for England and is only 10 off Sir Bobby Charlton's record.

At the age of 28 he could and probably should go on and break it - but he won't if he is playing out of position.

England have defensive issues too

Rooney did get one big chance to score his first goal at a World Cup finals - but he missed it, badly.

Leighton Baines put him in down the left side of the area and I thought there was a gap for a bending shot into the opposite corner of the goal.

So did the keeper, because he went that way - but Rooney pulled it wide of the near-post instead.

It would have looked great if it had gone in but it didn't and it has turned into another stick to beat him with.

Despite that miss, Rooney's attacking statistics still compare well with the other members of England's front four.

England's front four against Italy Player Rooney Sterling Sturridge Welbeck Stats: Opta Minutes played: 90 90 80 61 Touches: 43 58 38 39 Shots (on target): 3 (0) 4 (0) 3 (2) 1 (0) Chances created (assists) 3 (1) 1 (0) 1 (0) 0 (0) Passing accuracy 87.9% 90% 85.7% 88.9% Tackles 1 2 0 3

Rooney had three shots on goal - only Raheem Sterling had more. He also created three chances, more than any other England player.

But playing Rooney on the left had consequences for the team, not just his personal performance.

Despite his work-rate, he has been criticised because of the amount of space Italy found when they came forward down his flank, something they did time and time again in the first half.

That was because Rooney did not want to be chasing their right-back into our left-back position - he wanted to be high up the pitch causing Italy problems, which he did with his cross for Sturridge's goal.

Whether they targeted it as England's weak link or not, Italy's right side of Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva was their strongest department and it was down that side that Italy won the game.

Left-back Leighton Baines got more protection when Rooney switched with Danny Welbeck and went over to the right in the second half but it was still from that flank that Candreva crossed for Mario Balotelli to head the winner.

Encouraging signs for Uruguay test

There is definitely room for improvement defensively but I still saw far more positives than negatives in that England performance.

The biggest positive was Sterling, who was the star of the show.

The way he started the game was brilliant - in the first five minutes of his first World Cup, in his first competitive match and against such big opponents, he made his intentions clear by turning, heading for goal and firing a great shot into the side netting.

I am hoping for more of the same from him against Uruguay and Hodgson would not be restricting him if he puts him on the right or even the left side - he can still do what he does out wide.

Looking at the way Uruguay defended against Costa Rica in their opening game, there are definitely ways Sterling's pace can exploit their weakness at the back.

It will not be easy. Joel Campbell impressed for Costa Rica and, if he is fit enough to play this time, Luis Suarez will obviously be a threat for Uruguay.

But neither team scared me that much and I am still confident that we can win our next two games and get into the last 16.

Hodgson has done what most people - including me - had asked for by playing Sterling and Sturridge together.

Now he needs to resolve the Rooney issue and get the best out of England's best player too.

Hereford United still face two winding-up petitions despite having a case against them dismissed in court in London on Monday.

The club were on the Companies Court Winding Up List of cases to be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice, the latest winding-up threat served by Revenue and Customs (HMRC) over unpaid tax.

A court spokesman said that the case had been ""dismissed by the registrar"".

The deadline is then extended. 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference. 13 June - Accepted by the Southern League, subject to criteria laid down by the league. 16 June - New court case 'dismissed' as it had not been advertised properly.

BBC Hereford & Worcester report that the case is to be resubmitted by HMRC.

It appears as though the winding-up petition brought against the former Conference Premier side was not advertised properly prior to the hearing.

This is the third time that the club have been summoned to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand to face winding-up petitions from HMRC since the turn of the year.

In the previous two cases the money was found to settle the debt before the case was due to be heard, the second of them following Bulls fans' heartening fund-raising efforts.

But the club, expelled from the Conference last week after failing to pay their football creditors, have changed hands since then - and are now under the control of London businessman Tommy Agombar.

United had a further case, brought by former manager Martin Foyle over unpaid wages, adjourned for 28 days on 2 June.

Agombar met with Herefordshire County Council officials on Monday afternoon, following a call by Jesse Norman, the MP for Hereford and south Herefordshire, to defer any decision on potential changes to the leases on Hereford United's Edgar Street stadium for at least a month.

Norman told BBC Hereford and Worcester that is vital key issues are established before any major decisions are taken.

One to watch

Chile's Jorge Valdivia is a lavishly gifted playmaker. He has courted controversy off the field, but has rewarded coach Jorge Sampaoli's faith in him and scored the second goal in the 3-1 win over Australia on Friday.

This classic number 10 has served two lengthy bans from international football for alcohol-related indiscretions, and was kidnapped in Brazil in 2012.

However Sampaoli has called the 30-year-old an ""irreplaceable talent"", and compared him favourably to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Now playing his club football with Palmeiras in Brazil for the second time, Valdivia's goal against Australia was only his fifth for his country and his first since May 2010.

The key battle

Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez could face several of his club-mates, and potentially condemn them to an early exit from the tournament, when Chile play Spain in Manaus.

Sanchez, who became the most expensive player in Chilean football history with his £23m move from Udinese in 2011, scored one and laid on another in the 3-1 victory over Australia that has given his country such a good platform going into their meeting with the World Cup holders.

Chile's Alexis Sanchez, here fending off Australia's Mile Jedinak, scored 21 goals for Barcelona last season

The 25-year-old's Barca colleague Gerard Pique has been a mainstay of Spain's success in recent years, and could be set to play against Sanchez, but Del Bosque has admitted he could make ""some changes"" to his side in the wake of the defeat by the Netherlands that sent shockwaves through the tournament.

If Pique retains his place in Spain's back four, how he and his fellow defenders cope with Sanchez will go a long way to determining whether or not the World Cup holders' title defence ends a lot earlier than many would have predicted.

Stats of the day

Chile have never beaten Spain in their 10 previous encounters, losing eight and drawing two.

Spain's 5-1 defeat by the Netherlands was the heaviest margin of defeat by a reigning World Cup champion in the history of the tournament. The previous heaviest were Brazil losing 3-0 to France in 1998 and West Germany losing 6-3 to France in 1958.

By netting against Spain, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben became the first and second Netherlands players to score in three different World Cup tournaments - 2006, 2010 and 2014.

Tim Cahill, with four goals and one assist, has been involved in 56% of Australia's nine goals in World Cup history.

Cameroon only had one shot on target in the whole of their opening group game against Mexico - in the 91st minute.

Croatia have not won any of their past five World Cup matches, losing three and drawing two, with their most recent finals victory coming in 2002, when they beat Italy 2-1.

World Cup nostalgia

Spain beat Chile 2-1 in South Africa four years ago, but their first World Cup encounter took place at today's venue, the Maracana, in 1950 when Spain won 2-0.

Gerd Muller helped West Germany beat Australia 3-0 on this date at the 1974 World Cup.

Both Chile and Australia were in action on 18 June at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, having been drawn in the same group as the hosts and East Germany.

The Socceroos' interest in their first World Cup finals was effectively ended by their 3-0 defeat by West Germany, and it was to be a further 22 years before Australia made it to another tournament.

On the same day, Chile were held 1-1 by East Germany in West Berlin, and after a goalless draw with Australia in their final group match, the South Americans were also heading home.

Today's Brazilian lesson

Spain's vital match with Chile takes place at the Maracana, one of the most famous footballing venues in the world.

The Maracana Stadium was originally built for the 1950 tournament

It hosted Brazil's ill-fated meeting with Uruguay in 1950, where the host nation, needing only a draw to win the World Cup, were defeated 2-0 in front of 200,000 people.

Media playback is not supported on this device Day seven of the World Cup. BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker looks at the conditions for Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus.

The result was deemed a national catastrophe and dubbed O Maracanaco, a Portuguese term roughly translated as 'The Maracana Blow'.

Nevertheless it has subsequently witnessed such memorable moments such as Pele's 1,000th career goal and an emotional memorial service for Garrincha, one of Brazil's greatest and most loved footballers.

The refurbished 73,500-capacity stadium will host the final on Sunday, 13 July.

298,"Laurent Blanc scored the first World Cup golden goal, while another innovation was inspired by a set of traffic lights

The 2014 World Cup has seen innovations such as goalline technology and vanishing spray introduced to football's showpiece global event for the first time.

France benefited from the use of goalline technology in their opening win over Honduras, and the spray has been welcomed as an aid to referees in keeping players back 10 yards at free-kicks near the penalty area.

While those developments appear set to stay, what other innovations have previous World Cups witnessed - and were they all a success?

Red and yellow cards (from 1970)

Now as commonplace in a referee's equipment as a whistle, red and yellow cards were the brainchild of English referee Ken Aston, who officiated in the notorious 1962 World Cup game between Chile and Italy which became known as the Battle of Santiago, as well as the 1963 FA Cup final.

Aston was placed in charge of referees for the 1966 World Cup in England, when there was confusion after the hosts' stormy quarter-final against Argentina over which players had been cautioned, and Argentina skipper Antonio Rattin refused to leave the pitch after being sent off.

Driving in his car, and halted by a set of traffic lights on Kensington High Street, Aston had his idea: ""The traffic light turned red. I thought, 'Yellow, take it easy; red, stop, you're off'.""

With language barriers no longer a problem, red and yellow cards were introduced at the 1970 World Cup and have been adopted worldwide since, with variants appearing in many other sports.

Sent off in a World Cup final Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti (Argentina v West Germany, 1990)

and (Argentina v West Germany, 1990) Marcel Desailly (France v Brazil, 1998)

(France v Brazil, 1998) Zinedine Zidane (France v Italy, 2006)

(France v Italy, 2006) John Heitinga (Netherlands v Spain, 2010)

What happened next? Five yellow cards were shown by German referee Kurt Tschenscher in the opening game of the 1970 World Cup between Mexico and the USSR, but not a single red card was shown at the tournament.

On 14 June 1974, Chile's Carlos Caszely was the first man to be shown a red card in a World Cup, after picking up a second caution.

English referee Graham Poll famously erred at the 2006 tournament, showing Croatia defender Josip Simunic three yellow cards before brandishing a red.

Substitutions (from 1970)

Jimmy Greaves was a spectator at the 1966 final

As Geoff Hurst scored his hat-trick for England in the 1966 final, the man he replaced, Jimmy Greaves, was watching from the sidelines, dressed in a suit and tie, because substitutes were not permitted at the World Cup until 1970.

England's super subs David Platt (v Belgium in 1990), Michael Owen (v Romania in 1998) and Steven Gerrard (v Sweden in 2006) are the only England substitutes to score at a World Cup

Keith Peacock of Charlton was the first substitute used in the English Football League on 21 August 1965, but at the World Cup, that honour went to Soviet forward Anatoliy Puzach in the opening game of 1970 against Mexico.

What happened next? Until 1990, teams were able to name five substitutes, of whom two could be used.

From 1994 onwards, any members of the squad - except suspended players - were eligible to come off the bench, with the 1994 limit of two outfield subs, plus a goalkeeper, superseded by the standard three-substitution rule since 1998.

Golden goals (1998-2002)

With teams increasingly cagey in extra time of drawn knockout games, and some seemingly happy to chance their arm in a penalty shootout, the 'golden goal' immediately won the game as soon as either side scored in extra time.

From 1993, it was trialled in minor competitions such as the Auto Windscreens Shield in England, when a golden goal twice decided the final (in 1995 and 1998), as it did in the 1996 and 2000 European Championship finals, and the 2001 Uefa Cup final.

World Cup golden goals 1998 (second round) - Laurent Blanc for France v Paraguay

for France v Paraguay 2002 (second round) - Henri Camara for Senegal v Sweden

for Senegal v Sweden 2002 (second round) - Ahn Jung-Hwan for South Korea v Italy

for South Korea v Italy 2002 (quarter-final) - Ilhan Mansiz for Turkey v Senegal

Four World Cup ties at two tournaments were settled by golden goals - Laurent Blanc in 1998, and Henri Camara, Ahn Jung-Hwan and Ilhan Mansiz in 2002.

Far from promoting attacking football, at times it seemed to have the reverse effect as teams played conservatively because they did not want to concede.

What happened next? A variation, the 'silver goal' - whereby a knockout game would stop after the first period of extra time if one side were in front - was used at Euro 2004, but both golden and silver goals were discontinued that year.

Italian side Perugia attempted to sack South Korea's Ahn Jung-Hwan after his golden goal knocked Italy out of the 2002 World Cup, while the player responded by refusing to turn up for pre-season training.

Replays - or coin tosses or the drawing of lots - were traditionally the method used to separate sides level after extra time, with Italy beating Yugoslavia in the 1968 European Championship final replay, two days after the final.

Penalty shootouts were used in club competitions such as the European Cup from 1970 (although not in England's FA Cup until 1991), and first appeared at a major tournament when Czechoslovakia overcame West Germany in the Euro 76 final.

Adopted for the 1978 tournament, a shootout was not required at a World Cup until 1982, when West Germany knocked France out at the semi-final stage.

What happened next? A World Cup match has been settled on penalties on 22 occasions, including the 1994 and 2006 finals.

Germany (if you include West Germany) are the most successful team, with four wins and no defeats, while England are the only team to have lost three World Cup shootouts and not won one.

Belgium, Paraguay and South Korea all hold a 100% record in shootouts, scoring five out of five kicks. Switzerland are the only country to miss every penalty they have taken in a shootout. They were beaten 3-0 by Ukraine in 2006.

Three points for a win (from 1994)

What else was new in 1994? The back-pass rule, introduced in 1992 to encourage attacking play after a less than memorable 1990 World Cup, was in force

introduced in 1992 to encourage attacking play after a less than memorable 1990 World Cup, was in force It was also the first year in which World Cup match officials were able to eschew the traditional black shirts in favour of brighter colours

in favour of brighter colours Also making their World Cup debuts were numbers on the front of players' shirts, and names on their backs

on the front of players' shirts, and on their backs Apart from penalty shootouts, the only person to miss a penalty at the tournament was singer Diana Ross during an elaborately choreographed opening ceremony

Three (rather than two) points for a win were introduced into the English Football League in 1981 in a bid to encourage more attacking play.

It gradually made its way into most other major leagues over the next decade and a half, but was not adopted at a World Cup until 1994, after negative tactics marred the 1990 tournament.

What happened next? It made no difference in 1994, 2002 or 2006, when the same teams would have qualified from the group stage under two points for a win.

However, in 1998, Paraguay would have finished top of Group D ahead of Nigeria, which would have given them different opposition in the second round, when both teams bowed out.

In 2010, New Zealand - undefeated after drawing all three group games - would have qualified for the second round in place of Slovakia, who lost to the Netherlands in round two.

Golf carts for injured players (1994)

Italy legend Franco Baresi was injured during the final, but returned to play the full 120 minutes - and miss his penalty in the shootout

One of a raft of innovations for the 1994 World Cup in the United States was that, rather than being treated on the pitch or carried off on a stretcher, players would be driven off by an electric cart to receive medical treatment.

The vehicles used - compared to golf buggies or milk floats - added a slightly comedic air to a colourful World Cup.

What happened next? Golf carts have not reappeared at any subsequent World Cups, although some occasional examples remain, such as at English club side Reading.

As recently as last summer, Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano was sent off for kicking the driver of an injury cart as he was wheeled off during a World Cup qualifier against Ecuador.

300,"From Rio de Janeiro

If England manager Roy Hodgson needed to advertise the air of positivity that still surrounds his squad despite the opening World Cup defeat by Italy, Daniel Sturridge was the perfect front man for the campaign.

England losses can never be a cause for celebration - but the trademark pessimism that usually greets such results remains conspicuous by its absence here in Rio.

Brazil 2014: Hodgson opens up Roy Hodgson has tried hard to make his team more accessible by having training next to the beach, choosing a hotel in Rio which is open to the public, Q&As with fans and trips to different parts of Rio.

Hodgson and his players may have left the Amazonian rainforest after going down 2-1 to the Italians with an air of despondency and disappointment, but there is no doubt it had cleared by the time they touched down after their long flight back to base.

In past tournaments, a loss of such significance is usually the signal for a bout of navel-gazing and questions about where England had gone wrong at such an early stage of the World Cup.

The inquest, of course, could still come should they lose the decisive meeting with Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday. For now, though, both the England camp and those who observed them here in Brazil and back home liked most of what they saw in the Arena Amazonia.

In the absence of any serious expectations of winning this World Cup, the minimum requirement was to at least hint at a brighter future. The performances of the likes of Liverpool striker Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck and, briefly as a substitute, Ross Barkley delivered that.

England boss Roy Hodgson looks relaxed alongside Sir Trevor Brooking during training

And at England's Urca Military Base training headquarters, adjacent to Sugarloaf Mountain and away from the increasing hustle and bustle of the Copacabana - where the Fanfest is in full effect and the flags of all World Cup nations are on show, the mood remains upbeat and buoyant.

Sturridge and Welbeck were presented to the media on Monday, an England double act stretching back to their under-21 days and now rivals at each end of the East Lancashire Road at Liverpool and Manchester United.

South Africa 2010: Camp Capello The boot-camp regime of an austere, soulless England training base, where boredom ate away at the players.

If Welbeck was the smiling and modest straight man, the exuberant Sturridge was animated, witty and full of confidence that a World Cup meeting with Liverpool team-mate and Uruguay talisman Luis Suarez will not result in the end of England's involvement.

Sturridge, going through bottles of water at regular intervals after another gruelling training session in fierce heat at England's picturesque base, was right on message about Suarez. No special treatment and no talk of fear or apprehension - England will be taking on the Uruguay team, not one man.

And when he revealed his mum's pre-match message before Italy was ""mash it up son"", England's goalscorer in that defeat looked like a man in the mood to do something similar when the World Cup roadshow moves that short flight to Sao Paulo.

Sturridge said: ""I don't think there are fears or anxieties. We're all excited. We understand if we continue playing like we did, we will get results. It's not if we will win, it's when.""

England looked sharp as they trained in the build-up to Thursday's game against Uruguay

England have no time to wait, though - that win needs to come right away.

The optimism around England still extends, at least for now, to those of us in the media who have become somewhat fatalistic about these campaigns, especially after the torture of the non-event that constituted their effort in South Africa four years ago.

In contrast to some of the public perception, no-one in this travelling party wishes ill on England in order to conduct a forensic examination of their failings - although judgement cannot be escaped should the worst happen against Uruguay.

Germany 2006: Sven says 'relax' Sven-Goran Eriksson had such a laid-back attitude, players' wives and girlfriends were allowed to stay alongside the squad. They became a focus of media attention and the term ""Wags"" was coined.

England's players were in lively mood going through their paces in the open part of their Urca training session - and there was the added bonus of the sight of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain doing some short, sharp drills that suggested he is now closing in on full fitness after his knee injury.

He was wearing strapping but went through a strenuous session away from the main squad and looked good.

There are, inevitably, issues to resolve and Wayne Rooney's position in England's team - if not his actual place, as Hodgson still seems to retain faith in the Manchester United striker - is still a matter for discussion.

It is increasingly clear that Rooney is, to a large extent, a wasted asset on the flanks and most expert eyes believe he either plays as a striker, behind the striker or not at all.

Sturridge and Welbeck both caught the eye during England's opening defeat by Italy

Sturridge showed enough against Italy to demonstrate he must remain as the spearhead, so Hodgson must decide whether to move Sterling, so effective against Italy, to reposition Rooney.

He must also weigh up how any change will impact on left-back Leighton Baines, who struggled badly against Italy, not helped by a lack of protection from Rooney who, in his defence, was attempting to adapt to an unfamiliar role.

The bigger England picture, though, remains bright and healthy. Confidence, if Sturridge's body language is any measure, has not been damaged by the disappointment of Saturday.

Only time will tell if England threw their best punch at Italy on Saturday - but a glance around the camp on Monday suggested they still have a few shots left to land.",World Cup 2014: England remain positive despite Italy defeat,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75575000/jpg/_75575470_daniel_sturridge_pa.jpg,2014-06-16 21:22:59,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27875038
301,"It seemed this World Cup would see all the biggest stars shine on the grandest stage of all.

Neymar was the first to take his chance. Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben followed suit. Karim Benzema got in on the act. Then Lionel Messi lived up to his billing.

There was only one man we were still waiting for and Monday was Cristiano Ronaldo's opportunity to join the party.

The 29-year-old two-time Ballon D'or winner had declared himself ""100%"" fit during Sunday's pre-match news conference, adding that he has nothing to prove at this level despite underperforming in his two previous World Cups, with just two goals in 10 matches.

But the Real Madrid forward fluffed his lines as Portugal were demolished 4-0 by Germany.

There were, of course, mitigating circumstances. His preparations were disrupted by tendinosis in his left knee and by a thigh injury, while a 37th-minute red card for Portugal defender Pepe diluted the forward's effectiveness.

Nonetheless, Ronaldo failed to shine as Thomas Muller stole his thunder.

Portugal conceded four goals in a World Cup for the first time in their history

That might not have been in the script, but the Portugal captain still looked in high spirits as he left the Arena Fonte Nova on Monday. However, his refusal to conduct any media interviews was perhaps more instructive.

In the early stages of the contest, it appeared that he would make a statement on the pitch. One typically surging run set up Hugo Almeida for the game's first opening, before Ronaldo drew a sharp save from Manuel Neuer after busting clear.

Key facts This was the fourth World Cup in a row that Germany opened their campaign by scoring four goals or more.

Only Spain (17) have won more penalties at the World Cup than Germany (13).

Those actions were redolent of the man who almost single-handedly sealed Portugal's place in Brazil with a sensational hat-trick in the qualifying play-off second leg in Sweden; of the player who finished the season with 50 goals or more in all competitions for the fourth consecutive year as Real Madrid won their 10th European Cup.

In Europe's top five leagues last season, only Liverpool's Luis Suarez could match his haul of 31 goals, and nobody came close to his minutes-to-goals ratio (81.94), number of shots - both in total and on target - and the number of goals from outside the penalty area. Ronaldo also created more chances in La Liga than any of his previous campaigns at the Bernabeu.

He's the best player in the world, voted from the best... He's always a threat, even with 10 men he looks dangerous. Per Mertesacker talking about Cristiano Ronaldo

He looked like Portugal's only threat in those opening stages, but his influence began to wane, Germany scored twice to take control, Pepe went sent off, a third goal arrived and his team were buried.

Team-mates constantly looked to Ronaldo - just after the half hour, Fabio Coentrao inexplicably attempted to find him in the box when he was in a glorious position to score himself - but it is difficult to remember many individuals shining at a World Cup without a strong side around them.

On Sunday, Ronaldo told reporters: ""I believe one player is not a team. I'm here in the national team to help. I can make a difference in some of the games, but I can't carry the whole team on my back.""

This probably goes some way to show the difference between his form for club and country.

Before the Germany defeat, Ronaldo averaged 3.8 shots per game in World Cup matches compared to 5.73 in La Liga last term. His other numbers were no more flattering: 1.5 shots on target per game compared to 3.1 for Real, a goal every 422 minutes rather than every 81.94, and an assist every 844 minutes against 282.22.

When the former Manchester United winger's name was read out before kick-off, the noise was deafening, but his followers would not get what they came to see.

On the hour mark, he was given a platform. A free-kick, 25 yards out, left of centre. Ronaldo territory.

He marked out his run-up - a good 10 yards - placed the ball delicately and glared at his target with legs apart, arms rigidly pointed down, chest pushed out. There was a collective holding of breath, cameras lenses were trained. Then he shot straight into the wall.

There would soon be more frustration as referee Milorad Mazic rejected Portugal's penalty appeal after a challenge on Eder. An irate Ronaldo chased after the Serbian official, gesticulating wildly.

Thomas Muller World Cup facts Muller has scored six goals in his last four World Cup games.

Thomas Muller is the first player to score a hat-trick against Portugal in a World Cup game.

Another free-kick dribbled along the ground before he finally connected brilliantly with one. It was heading in, only for Neuer to position himself well enough to punch it away to safety.

By then, the game had already gone. But at least Ronaldo proved his fitness ahead of games against Ghana and the United States, games which Portugal must win if they are to advance to the last 16.

""He's the best player in the world, voted from the best,"" Germany defender Per Mertesacker told BBC Sport. ""He's always a threat; even with 10 men he looks dangerous.

""We tried to deal with him, not leave him in one-against-one situations. We tried to cope with him with good defensive work and we did it collectively well today.""

He smells the situation - he's always there, where the ball is. Lukas Podolski on Thomas Muller

At the forefront of a fine Germany team performance was Muller.

Coming into the finals, there was no shortage of debate about boss Joachim Low's decision to name just one recognised striker in his squad - 36-year-old Miroslav Klose - but Bayern Munich attacker Muller played the lone forward's role to perfection in the oppressive Salvador heat.

He was a handful from the first minute with his constant harrying, non-stop running, intelligent movement and knack of being in the right place at the right time.

Having won the Golden Boot and the award as the best young player in South Africa four years ago, Muller picked up where he left off and - at just 24 years of age - has now scored eight World Cup goals compared to Ronaldo's two.

Self-christened as 'The Raumdeuter' - the 'interpreter of space' - because of his intelligent play and ability to pick up pockets of space among opposition defences, Muller was unstoppable.

Muller has now scored eight goals in seven World Cup matches

""Thomas is a crazy guy and he always has his foot in the right position,"" Germany's Lukas Podolski explained. ""He smells the situation - he's always there, where the ball is.""

Fellow forward Andre Schurrle added: ""He's very important because he searches all the time for free space, he's on his legs for 90 minutes and he tries to do everything. He can go on to become an all-time great.""

Thomas Muller facts Age: 24 Club: Bayern Munich Position: Forward Caps: 48 Goals: 19

Former Germany striker and current team manager Oliver Bierhoff highlighted Muller's ""will to score, to try every match for 90 minutes to be in the game"", adding: ""If he doesn't have a good day he's still trying to do something, interacting with his colleagues.

""It's difficult for the opponents to understand what he's doing. Often he doesn't know it himself. Technically he is very good, he's hungry, he's always aware something can happen and never giving up. He can play the 'false nine' role very well.""

Although Muller will dominate the headlines, Germany were exceptional as a unit.

Following strong starts by the likes of Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands and France, Low's side have laid down a marker of their own and, after finishing third, third and second at the last three World Cups, will be confident of challenging for a title they have not won since 1990.

They ensured the first week in Brazil continues to thrill. Ronaldo, though, has some catching up to do.

Striker Gwennan Harries says Wales cannot underestimate Belarus when the sides meet in their Women's World Cup qualifier on Thursday.

Jarmo Matikainen's side are five points behind Group Six leaders England following the 1-0 win over Turkey on Saturday.

Wales beat Belarus 1-0 in Cardiff earlier in the campaign.

""We can't take them lightly. It's going to be a tough game,"" said Bristol Academy's Harries.

""They're only two places behind us in the Uefa rankings and they're a very difficult side to break down.

""We've seen that when they came to us. They sat back and we ran out of ideas at times.""

Wales' remaining group games 19 June: Belarus (away) 21 August: England (home) 17 September: Ukraine (away)

Harries has not featured in the qualifying campaign because of a serious knee injury, sustained against the Netherlands in November 2012, and recently suffered a setback.

Wales strengthened their grip on second place in the group with an unconvincing victory over Turkey at Haverfordwest's Bridge Meadow.

""It shows how far we've come because, go back a couple of years, we probably would have played well in these types of games but lost,"" said former Cardiff City and Everton player Harries.

""It shows we've got that real quality, real spirit and fight. We're grinding out these victories. This is the most points we've had on the board.""

England need four points from their last three games, which includes a trip to Wales, to reach the 2015 World Cup final after a comfortable 3-0 win in Belarus.

Wales are six points ahead of third-placed Ukraine, who have two games in hand.

Four runners-ups from the seven groups will go into two rounds of play-off matches for the remaining World Cup spot.

""It's a huge ask and let's not forget we're ranked fourth in that group,"" added Harries.

""We're really outperforming where we should be in this group.

308,"Frank Lampard believes team-mate Wayne Rooney still holds the key to England's World Cup hopes, after claiming there is ""an agenda"" against the striker.

Scrutiny of Rooney's place in the side intensified when he was played in a wide role in the 2-1 loss to Italy.

But he looks certain to start against Uruguay as manager Roy Hodgson ponders whether to move him into a more central role and switch Raheem Sterling wide.

Midfielder Lampard said: ""He is an exceptional player as we all know.""

Lampard, facing the media at England's training headquarters, added: ""If we are going to do well in this World Cup, players like Wayne are going to come to the fore because that is what they do.""

The last time England exited a World Cup in the group stage was 1958 when they drew all three games, including against Brazil (pictured)

Hodgson's decision to use Rooney, 28, on the flank and 19-year-old Liverpool winger Sterling through the middle against the Italians has led to a debate about whether the Manchester United striker is in danger of losing his place.

However, the indications are he will face Uruguay in Thursday's Group D game in Sao Paulo - one England cannot afford to lose if they are to keep their World Cup hopes alive.

Sterling said he and Rooney returning to their regular roles could be positive but added it was ""up to the manager"".

Lampard, 35, who played in Euro 2004 when Rooney made his name as an Everton teenager, insisted the striker was strong enough to cope with the scrutiny on his position.

""Of all the players I've met in an England shirt, Wayne is one of the toughest,"" he said.

Analysis ""If Wayne Rooney does not play in the number 10 position behind Daniel Sturridge in England's next World Cup game against Uruguay on Thursday, then I would not play him at all."" Read more of Alan Shearer's views on Rooney's England role in his latest blog.

""I remember him coming into the dressing room at 17, warming up, just getting his kit on and going out and playing. He still has that mindset. I'm not picking the manager's team for him but Wayne is a very tough boy.

""Top players understand what it is. They understand what comes with it. It's great and then some negativity comes along. I think Wayne looks ready to show what he can do on the pitch. He looks very focused to me.""

England coach Gary Neville told BBC Sport that Rooney can cope with the ""drama"" of the attention on him, but Lampard believes the debate is threatening to undermine the World Cup campaign for the squad as a whole.

""If you are a human being, no matter how tough you are, if every time you read a paper or look at the TV, and there are people debating his position, I don't see how that can be positive,"" he continued.

""If you want people to do well I don't see how you can keep focusing on one player rather than the team and say that might not be detrimental, no matter the ability of the player, whether it is Lionel Messi, Neymar or whoever.

Group D permutations for England If England beat Uruguay they will face Costa Rica knowing victory is likely to see them qualify. If England draw then victory against Costa Rica could be enough, if Costa Rica lose against Italy on Friday. If England lose then they would need to beat Costa Rica and hope Italy beat Uruguay and Costa Rica.

""Players like Raheem Sterling are coming through and doing very well and we are slightly over-fixated on one player who has been our best player, our top goalscorer in qualifying and will break the England goalscoring record.""

309,"John Collins described returning to Celtic as an ""honour""

Celtic have appointed John Collins as assistant manager to Ronny Deila.

Former Celtic midfielder Collins, 46, described returning to the Scottish Premiership champions as ""an honour"".

Collins, a former Scotland international, will assist Deila following his appointment as Neil Lennon's successor earlier this month.

Media playback is not supported on this device Collins scores penalty against Brazil at World Cup 1998

""It is a huge honour for me to return to Celtic, the club which has always been such a major part of my life,"" Collins told Celtic's website.

Collins made 229 appearances for the club from 1990 to 1996 and also featured for Monaco, Everton, Fulham and Hibernian during his playing career.

The 58-time capped Scotland international managed Hibs and Charleroi, and held the director of football post at Livingston.

He said he was relishing the prospect of joining Deila's backroom staff.

""I am grateful to Ronny for giving me this wonderful opportunity and I look forward to working closely with him and the players to ensure that we can continue to bring the good times to Celtic,"" he said.

""I know what a great club Celtic is and I know exactly what the club means to our fans.

Ronny Deila says John Collins shares his football philosophy

""I will support the manager in every way and I am sure that together with our players, the backroom staff and the fans, we can all play our part in bringing success to the club.""

Deila expressed delight at his backroom appointment, adding: ""I have had a number of meetings with John, I can see what the club means to him and I can see the qualities that he will bring to Celtic.

""He is a first-class coach and has ideas on football which are very similar to mine so I am sure he will be a great addition to my team.""

Following Deila's appointment, Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said they were considering ""three or four options"" for an assistant boss.

England will have to raise their performance to beat Ukraine in Thursday's Women's World Cup qualifier, says boss Mark Sampson.

England maintained their 100% qualifying record with a 3-0 group win in Belarus on Saturday and have already beaten Ukraine 4-0 at home in May.

But Ukraine, third in Group Six behind leaders England, thrashed Montenegro 7-0 on Saturday.

""We'll have to go up a level,"" said Sampson, 31.

""Our passing will have to be crisper, we'll have to be quicker on the counter-attack and sharper in the final third.""

""We're expecting a tough encounter.""

""A lot of people felt the 4-0 scoreline was harsh on Ukraine when we beat them at Shrewsbury. They were hard to break down and good on the counter,"" he added.

""So it's going to be a real challenge and we'll have to be better than we were in Belarus on Saturday, even though I felt it was a good quality performance.""

Sampson's attacking options will be improved if Manchester City striker Toni Duggan recovers from the ankle injury that forced her out of Saturday's match.

Duggan scored eight goals in the six group games ahead of the trip to Belarus and Sampson said: ""We'd certainly like to have Toni available for selection.

""She has shown her capabilities in these group games and we'll be doing everything we can to get her fully fit in time.""

Victory in Lviv would clinch England's place at the finals in Canada in 2015 if Wales, second in the group, fail to beat Belarus, also on Thursday.

Claims that World Cup holders Spain are no longer the force they were have been exaggerated, says midfielder Xabi Alonso.

Spain face Chile in Rio on Wednesday keen to atone for their 5-1 humiliation by the Netherlands.

The 32-year-old Real Madrid player said: ""What you've heard in the press seems a little exaggerated to me.

""You cannot consider that this generation is finished. On the contrary, we are still alive.""

Alonso, who has made 110 caps for Spain, added: ""We want to demonstrate that and we have a perfect opportunity to do so. We still have a lot of things to say and we can still compete.""

Striker Fernando Torres admitted nothing but victory would do, and conceded Spain may have to alter their approach to avoid an early exit.

""The important thing is that we win, hopefully in our usual style, at the high level that allowed us to win the World Cup and the Euros,"" said the Chelsea striker, 30.

""And if we can't win like that, we have to win any way we can, because otherwise we'll have to go back home.""

Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque says his players must be inspired by the need to make amends for their crushing loss to the Netherlands.

Defeat has left the holders desperately in need of victory against Chile.

Del Bosque, who led Spain to victory in the 2010 World Cup and 2012 European Championship, said his players were ""deeply wounded"".

Del Bosque has suggested he will make changes - in both personnel and tactics - against a Chile side who beat Australia 3-1 in their opening match.

""I have assessed the situation and there will probably be some changes, not many but some,"" added the 63-year-old.

""You have to remember that those that didn't play the other day are also top players with big clubs.""

317,"Collins has held a coaching role with the SFA in the run up to his move to Celtic

Convention never was able to pin down new Celtic assistant manager John Collins.

His career path as a player was atypical of British footballers, since he was perfectly suited to thriving on the continent after a move to Monaco.

In a way, Collins' return to Celtic Park as assistant to Ronny Deila is fitting, even if it may at first seem unusual for a coach who previously managed Hibernian to a League Cup triumph and saved Charleroi from relegation to take on the role of a number two.

Collins' playing career Came through Hibernian's youth ranks before joining Celtic, with whom he won 1995 Scottish Cup

Joined Monaco in 1996 and won Ligue 1 the following year

Moves to Everton and Fulham followed

Won 58 Scotland caps, scoring 12 international goals, and played at Euro 96 and 1998 World Cup

Collins' years in coaching have always been eclectic. He was director of football at Livingston and has more recently been working as a youth coach for the Scottish Football Association.

The range of experience is varied, although Collins' latest appointment will provoke doubts among some Celtic fans, even if others are willing to acknowledge that common sense is also being applied.

He will provide Deila with knowledge and insight into Scottish football and the individuals the new Celtic manager will encounter.

There are plenty of other candidates who could act as sources of information, but Collins is likely to share much of Deila's coaching philosophy.

Idealism always came naturally to Collins. It is a misconception, for instance, that his spell at Monaco - where he won the Ligue 1 title and reached the Champions League semi-final - shaped his approach to the game.

It merely justified Collins' sense that it was a matter of self-responsibility to maximise your ability. He used to do sit-ups and press-ups while watching television, much to the surprise of team-mates he was room-sharing with.

Collins never wholly escaped that quizzical reaction. When he was in charge of Hibs, some players claimed that he bared his midriff to use his own muscled torso as an example to the players.

Collins won the League Cup within five months of taking over at Hibs

The former Scotland midfielder has always refuted the allegation - and a few members of the Easter Road squad were in revolt at the time - but it reflected a sense that an air of high-mindedness prevented Collins from succeeding at man management.

The spell in charge of the Edinburgh side ought to be a commendation, given their trophy win, the opening of a new training ground and Collins' success in effectively rebuilding the team following the departure of the best young talents.

There was a clash of personalities with Kevin Thomson when the player left for Rangers, though. And others, like goalkeeper Simon Brown, complained afterwards about Collins' methods.

Gripes are often the response to a coach or manager who sets stringent demands, but Collins' appointment at Celtic does not mean that a similar scenario will unfold at the club's Lennoxtown training base.

Deila, after all, will be in charge and is known to be active on the training ground. The Norwegian is keen on all aspects of player development - including education and personal attributes - and in implementing a culture of excellence at the club. The mantra would sound familiar to Collins because he has long espoused it himself.

New manager Deila has been assessing Celtic's matches from last season

There might be some wariness among the Celtic players, not least because captain Scott Brown was at Easter Road under Collins. But there seems no lingering resentment from Collins, who has often spoken appreciatively of Brown's ability and progress as a leading midfielder.

Nonetheless, he will need to win over any doubters in the Celtic squad. It will help that he is likely to share the idealism of Deila, but also that the Norwegian is renowned for his approach to man management.

It is the dynamic between Deila and Collins that is more significant than the new assistant's own reputation. Collins was a refined footballer and the same applies to his sense of how the game should be played, his insistence that players need to be fully professional in every aspect of their life and not just how they approach training or games.

A rapport between the two men is essential and Deila must be secure enough in his position to accept the suggestion of Collins' appointment.

Deila is not bringing any of his own coaching staff - and it is believed he has no intention of signing any Norwegian players in the coming weeks. However, he thinks very highly of Ghana international goalkeeper Adam Larsen Kwarasey, whom he worked with at Stromsgodset.

Deila has spent his time since moving to Glasgow watching footage of Scottish Premiership games and Celtic matches from last season. He will make his own judgements on the Scottish game and the requirements of his team, but Collins will provide a useful sounding board.

For all that Collins' career has been more noteworthy, there would be little clamour for him to succeed Deila if the Norwegian were to fail in his first season in the same way as Tony Mowbray, who lasted around nine months in the job.

Collins was identified as an ideal candidate for the assistant's role, but it is up to him to develop a relationship with the players and ensure there is no perceived arrogance or an unwillingness to deal with different personalities in different ways.

There will also need to be an accommodation by the Celtic players, since assuming that the difficulties at Hibs will recur at Lennoxtown will be counter-productive for them all. Collins, it has to be assumed, has Deila's full support.

As individuals there is a relationship to build, but there is already common ground in the way the two men think about how football should be played, how players should be coached and how individuals need to be responsible for their own career development and their own standards of behaviour.",Celtic assistant John Collins shares Ronny Deila's vision,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75601000/jpg/_75601531_john_collins.jpg,2014-06-17 19:49:31,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27896679

""It was a big occasion, my first competitive start,"" said Sterling, who plays both wide and off the striker for Liverpool.

""I tried to think of it as just another game and give it my best shot. It wasn't enough but the team did some really impressive stuff and we will go out on Thursday ready to go again.

""I tried to work hard for the team and help not just in the attacking bits but in defence as well. It was a difficult one because they had about three players around me every time.""

Group D permutations for England If England beat Uruguay they will face Costa Rica knowing victory is likely to see them qualify. If England draw then victory against Costa Rica could be enough, if Costa Rica lose against Italy on Friday. If England lose then they would need to beat Costa Rica and hope Italy beat Uruguay and Costa Rica.

He added: ""The people here just try to take the pressure off you so you can express yourself, which is the most important thing as a young player. They want you to show what you can do on the ball. I'm just learning and trying to be fearless in my approach to games.""

Former England defender Ferdinand said Sterling, who has five caps, had been ""amazing"" against Italy.

""He was the star man for us, the go-to guy,"" Ferdinand said.

""Sterling was so direct and so positive every time we got the ball and he was a defender's nightmare. He is quick, skilful and wants to attack you.""

On Thursday, Sterling looks likely to face Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez after he missed Uruguay's opening game 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica following knee surgery.

England, however, are focusing on Uruguay as a team, not just Suarez.

""We have been looking at them but we don't want to give too much away,"" said Sterling. ""We are trying to find ways in which we can really hurt them and I think the manager has been preparing really well for this game.""

322,"Scolari was Brazil's coach when they won their last World Cup in 2002

Brazil played better in their 0-0 draw against Mexico than in their opening World Cup win over Croatia, according to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.

The hosts scored three times against the Croats and might have matched that tally against Mexico but for the brilliant keeping of Guillermo Ochoa.

""In my opinion, the team played at least 10% better,"" said Scolari.

""They had a very good goalkeeper who had a very good day and that's why we didn't win.""

He added: ""The team is doing better and better. We still have a way to go and we can play well. I was pretty happy with what I saw on the pitch.""

Scolari, who led Brazil to their fifth World Cup victory in Japan and Korea in 2002, also praised Group A rivals Mexico for their performance.

""Here in Brazil we tend to believe that other players are not as good as we are and we thought that Mexico weren't any good - but today they played as well as we did,"" said the 65-year-old.

""They had around the same possession, around the same number of shots. They know how to play football. I don't think we got the result we expected yet I'm very pleased.""

Match analysis ""For the past year Scolari has been living on 'Paradise Island', until today. Let's see how he copes with that. ""Mexico were warriors with their heads in the right place. They kept their cool. They nearly came away with a win at the end.""

Meanwhile, Mexico coach Miguel Herrera praised keeper Ochoa, who twice denied Neymar, blocked an effort from David Luiz and tipped over Thiago Silva's header late in the game.

""I can't remember a goalkeeper performing like that in a World Cup,"" said Herrera.

""Playing against the favourites, on their home ground, the team showed that they can compete against absolutely anyone.""

Ochoa, who left French Ligue 1 side Ajaccio at the end of the season, added: ""It was very difficult, and I'm delighted to leave the field with the zero on the scoreboard.

""It was the game of my life.""

323,"Media playback is not supported on this device Gary Lineker on England's bright future

England have a bright future and should go into their match against Uruguay confident of victory, says former captain Gary Lineker.

Roy Hodgson's team, beaten 2-1 by Italy in their opening World Cup game on Saturday, play Uruguay on Thursday.

""It was an encouraging performance against Italy even if it was a rotten result,"" said Lineker.

""There is nothing for England to fear. What they have to do is reproduce the performance they showed against Italy.""

England completed 89.5% of their 267 passes in the opposition half which, going into Tuesday's matches, was the highest of any team in the tournament.

""Those statistics were extraordinary for an England team,"" added Match of the Day presenter Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 England appearances.

""I cannot remember England coming close to another team when it comes to those sorts of passing statistics.""

He said that if England keep playing the same way, then the ""future looks considerably brighter than it did even just a few months ago"", even if they ultimately fail to make it out of their group.

""England have got some terrific young players coming through,"" added the former Leicester, Tottenham, Everton and Barcelona frontman.

England played a 4-2-3-1 formation on Saturday, with Daniel Sturridge, 24, as a lone striker in front of Wayne Rooney, 28, Raheem Sterling, 19, and 23-year-old Danny Welbeck.

""England played some really good football,"" added Lineker. ""Sterling was exceptional. He took people on, he is strong, quick and dangerous.""

Lineker said he expected manager Roy Hodgson to pick a similar team for the game against Uruguay, although he conceded Rooney could be shifted into a different position after starting wide on the left against Italy.

Lineker played in two World Cups, starting 12 games and scoring 10 goals

But he added that ""all eyes will be on Sterling to see if he can perform as well"" as he did against the Italians.

Uruguay were beaten 3-1 by Costa Rica in their opening game and were without Luis Suarez as he continues to recover from knee surgery.

The Liverpool striker had keyhole surgery to repair meniscus damage in his left knee on 22 May.

""I'm sure Suarez will play some part - they have nothing to lose - but can he really be 100% fit?"" asked Lineker. ""I rather think not.""",World Cup 2014: Gary Lineker,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75601000/jpg/_75601861_75601860.jpg,2014-06-18 05:03:36,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27897129
324,"This was nothing like watching Brazil.

The Selecao have rarely looked so ordinary, so human. They trudged from the field at Estadio Castelao to a soundtrack of whistles, shoulders slumped, faces crumpled with frustration.

This was not in the script.

Some 6,000 Mexico fans serenaded their heroes, danced in the stands, revelled in Brazil's moment of anguish. A goalless draw was a setback for Brazil, as much as it was a significant step forward for their opponents.

And yet, as the Brazilian squad fronted up to the media after the match, it was hard not to reflect on the past.

A year ago, almost to the day, Fortaleza had embraced Brazil as few other cities do. Driven on by a partisan crowd, they had done enough to beat Mexico and no more.

Brazil beat Mexico 2-0 in Fortaleza on 19 June 2013 en route to winning the Confederations Cup

Goals by Neymar and Jo gave Brazil momentum that would sweep them all the way to the Maracana and a thrilling victory over Spain in the Confederations Cup final.

As with 12 months ago, Fortaleza played its part. Every corner of every street was decked in yellow and green, every child dressed in those familiar colours.

The pride at hosting Brazil in a World Cup match was tangible and, at times, all-consuming. On the streets around the stadium, crowds gathered to see the team coach pass by. A 200ft Brazil flag draped over a crane set the mood.

The anthem was every bit as stirring, every bit as passionate and patriotic as it had been a year ago. In homes around the country, Brazilian TV put the words on every screen. No-one held back. Neymar was no exception, his tears flowing as the anthem drew to a close.

The stage was set for the Selecao to play their part. Brazil expected. But history did not repeat itself.

Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari spent much of the 90 minutes kicking water bottles around the technical area.

This was an evening of frustration on the field, in the stands and all around the country. This was a match in which Mexico exposed Brazil's over-reliance on the creativity of Neymar and the craft of Oscar.

Fred struggled to impose himself, his touch, once again, letting him down at the crucial moments. The Fluminense striker attempted 16 passes, half of which failed to find their target.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's side were again well short of their best at Estadio Castelao

The opening-day victory over Croatia had done little to pacify the critics. Then, Fred had no shots, no assists and did not make a single run into the attacking third.

His reaction to the slightest of tugs by Dejan Lovren won Brazil a fortuitous penalty but his effectiveness is now being questioned like never before. Jo, who replaced him in the second half, was no more convincing.

Paulinho and Luis Gustavo failed to establish any kind of superiority in midfield. Few would question their guts, but they lacked guile.

This was a Brazil team with style but no substance. A Brazil team that faces more questions, more headaches.

In the distant past, this city holds difficult memories for Brazil, too. It was here, 39 matches ago, that Brazil last lost a match on home turf, 1-0 to Paraguay in 2002. There were periods in the second half against Mexico that record was threatened.

From the outside, this feels like a team straining under the weight of expectation. And yet that was not in evidence as the Brazil players came through the rat-run occupied by the world's media. Every player stopped to speak. There was no sense of panic, no sense this had been the setback the world believed it was.

Defender David Luiz said: ""We are not down. Mexico are a great team, they have great players. We were unlucky in some moments, their goalkeeper had a great game.

""But it is OK, that is what happens in World Cups. We have great belief in ourselves. The country is with us.""

History of all kinds was fresh in the memory at Estadio Castelao. But, as the players left the stadium and boarded the team bus, Scolari may have been reminding them of another memory.

Brazil do not often draw 0-0. This was only the second time in 26 World Cup matches, but the omens are not all negative. At the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, Brazil drew 0-0 with England in the group stage and went on to lift the trophy for the first time.

On the evidence of the draw with Mexico, this Brazil side still has some way to go to repeat that feat.

The pressure is extraordinary, the weight of expectation immense, but this is a team that stands and falls together. Unity is at the heart of what Scolari is trying to build.

Bigger tests may await, but Brazil must improve if they are to win a sixth World Cup this summer.

Did you know?... This is only Brazil's second goalless draw in their past 26 World Cup games. This is the first time in four World Cup games against Brazil that Mexico have not conceded, however they are still yet to score against the Selecao. Brazil's Fred completed eight of 16 attempted passes against Mexico (50%). Brazil have lost just one of their 35 World Cup matches in the first round/group stages of the World Cup since 1970 (W27 D7). Only in three World Cup games since (and including) 1966 have Mexico mustered fewer shots on target than they managed tonight (2).

329,"2004 Belgian GP: Schumacher wins a staggering seventh title by a country mile after finishing second behind McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen at Spa-Francorchamps

During 2012, BBC Sport profiled 20 of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time. Chief F1 writer Andrew Benson profiled the drivers - here he looks at Michael Schumacher.

Michael Schumacher's monumental achievements came about through a perfect storm of an exceptionally talented and hard-working driver, ground-breaking technical achievement, a bottomless pit of money and a ruthless management that exploited every last avenue to its benefit.

The result was a redefinition of what was possible in Formula 1 - five consecutive world championships; 56 victories in seven years from 2000-6; a total of seven titles and 91 wins for Schumacher's career.

Michael Schumacher facts Born: 3 January 1969 First GP win: Belgium 1992 Nationality: German Last GP win: China 2006 Championships: 7 (1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004) Races started: 303 Wins: 91 (155 podium finishes)

At his disposal in the early 2000s, Schumacher had a number of advantages from which probably no other driver in history has benefited for so long.

On top of those already mentioned was arguably the greatest of all - bespoke Bridgestone tyres effectively custom-made for Schumacher himself.

These factors were all instrumental in Schumacher re-writing the record books; he holds virtually every landmark statistic in the sport.

He found himself in the position to exploit them, though, because he was the greatest driver of his era.

That era spanned the gap between the end of the Senna/Prost years and the dawning of a new age with a depth of talent and opposition far richer than Schumacher had to face.

Through the late 1990s and into 2000, only Mika Hakkinen was in his league - the Finn had the speed but not the same discipline and consistency. Then, when Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen arrived in the early 21st century, they only rarely had cars that could challenge Schumacher and Ferrari.

Classic F1 - Belgian Grand Prix 1992

Regardless, Schumacher at his peak would have been a challenge for the best of any era. His combination of blistering pace, metronomic consistency and dubious morality was a potent mix indeed.

His particular excellence was his ability to operate at his peak on every lap, of every race, for years at a time. Ferrari - and before them Benetton, where he won his first two titles - exploited this to leave less-fortunate rivals looking flat-footed.

This is one of two over-riding characteristics that defined his 'first' career. The other is controversy.

It followed Schumacher from the very beginning, when after a jaw-dropping debut with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix he was poached by Benetton - with a little help from F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone - by the next race, despite being under contract.

A first win came in his first full season, on the first anniversary of his debut, and in the mixed conditions in which he so-often excelled.

A second arrived a little over a year later in Portugal, fending off the new world champion Alain Prost with the help of the sort of questionable tactics in defence which were to become all too familiar.

The trickle soon turned into a flood - both in terms of victories and controversies.

Ayrton Senna joined Williams for 1994 and was expected to continue the team's domination of F1, but the new FW16 was a handful, and Benetton had pulled out all the stops with the B194.

Senna, his skill over-riding deficiencies in his car, took pole position for the first race in Brazil but he was chased down and beaten by Schumacher, Senna suffering the ignominy of spinning in the closing laps in his desperation to keep up.

Michael Schumacher joined Ferrari in 1995

When he was taken out at the first corner at the second race at Aida in Japan, Senna stood watching Schumacher's Benetton canter to victory, and became convinced something was amiss. He felt Schumacher was benefiting from electronic driver-aids that had been banned after 1993.

It was the start of a cataclysmic year. Senna was killed at the next race in Imola and Schumacher dominated the season before things started to unravel at Benetton.

A too-perfect start in France got tongues wagging, before Schumacher was disqualified from the British Grand Prix for ignoring black flags.

At the disciplinary hearing into that offence, Schumacher was given a two-race ban - and the team were cleared of using illegal driver aids found in the car's electronics on the grounds there was no evidence they had been used.

The ban - and a second disqualification after winning in Belgium because his under-floor plank was too worn - meant the title went down to the wire between Schumacher and Williams' Damon Hill.

Schumacher won it but only after he deliberately drove into Hill, who was trying to pass him after seeing the Benetton go off the track at the previous corner. The collision put both men out of the race.

After crushing Williams drivers Hill and David Coulthard in 1995, Schumacher joined Ferrari. His first season at Maranello was one of his greatest.

He won three races in a car that was miles off the pace, his driving on a separate level from the rest. The best was a stunning victory in torrential rain in Spain, where he routinely lapped as much as five seconds faster than anyone else.

When the key people from Benetton - technical director Ross Brawn and chief designer Rory Byrne - joined Schumacher at Maranello for 1997, it was the start of a new era that changed the face of F1.

Working under team boss Jean Todt, they would redefine what an F1 car was capable of - not only in terms of performance, but also reliability and consistency of operation, raising standards to a level that it took rivals years to match.

Michael Schumacher came out of retirement in 2009

Schumacher took the 1997 title to the wire against Williams' Jacques Villeneuve - only to be disqualified from the season (but allowed to keep his victories) after trying for the second time to win a championship by barging a rival off the track. This time, it failed, and he was found guilty.

He came close again in a titanic battle with Hakkinen and McLaren in 1998, broke his leg in a crash in the middle of 1999, and finally delivered in 2000. The long-awaited title - Ferrari's first drivers' crown for 21 years - came after a stupendous flat-out battle with Hakkinen at Suzuka in Japan.

That opened the flood-gates; Schumacher and Ferrari won another four championships in a row. Only in 2003 did he face any sustained opposition.

The winning streak finally ended in 2005, when a rule change intended to stop Ferrari in their tracks did exactly that - Bridgestone were unable to match rivals Michelin in building tyres that now needed to last an entire race.

The rule was quickly reversed for 2006 and Ferrari were competitive once more. But again Schumacher hit below the belt in his title fight, notoriously parking his car on the track in qualifying at Monaco to stop Alonso taking pole.

In the end, Schumacher lost the title battle to Alonso, but his first career ended on a high with a superlative fight-back drive at the final race in Brazil.

After three years away, struggling to find something to give his life meaning, Schumacher was back, this time with Mercedes, but it was as a pale shadow of what he used to be. Only rarely did he get anywhere close to what he was.

His generally underwhelming performances ended with him being forced into retirement by Mercedes' decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. And they have ignited a debate within F1 about the advantages Schumacher had at his disposal, and how in that context his career should be judged.

But while he undoubtedly had the cards stacked in his favour for long periods, the evidence for him being one of the greatest is overwhelming.

For some it's the many outstanding victories; for others it's how he used to blitz the field on his first flying lap on a Friday morning, just to emphasise his superiority.

For this writer, it was all that and more. Above all, it was a qualifying session in Argentina in 1996, when he hauled the recalcitrant Ferrari F310 onto the front row with a display of driving acrobatics that had to be seen to be believed.

At times like that, the avalanche of numbers was irrelevant; it was perfectly clear how good Michael Schumacher was.

A few minutes later, the feet of motor racing legend Mario Andretti are on solid ground, another challenge ticked off a list already crammed with an array of remarkable achievements.

Andretti's F1 title success in 1978 was largely down to the Lotus 79 car with its 'ground effect' aerodynamics

The Italian-born American is a motorsport icon who has always lived his life on the edge. His racing career lasted 35 years. He won championships in Formula 1, IndyCar and USAC dirt cars. He also tasted victory in Nascar and World Sports Cars. The man exists to race.

And to win... six times in F1 during 1978, when driving the Lotus 79 with its 'ground effect' aerodynamics - a design concept that used the pressured air underneath the car to increase downforce.

His domination of races that year draws parallels with Lewis Hamilton's current supremacy at the wheel of his Mercedes, thanks to yet more innovative interpretations of modern Formula 1 design regulations.

Andretti loved racing so much that he competed in Formula 1 and American equivalent IndyCar simultaneously for a period, flying backwards and forwards from his base in Europe to the United States.

""Jet-lag wasn't a problem,"" remembers Andretti, who quit single-seater racing 20 years ago, aged 54. ""I got over it. I wanted to drive. I probably would have driven for nothing. Fortunately, I didn't have to.""

But when he hung up his helmet in 1994 - having partnered Nigel Mansell in the Newman-Haas IndyCar team during 1993 - Andretti knew he would need to make adjustments.

""It's because I've been on the other side,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Travelling to a motor race as a spectator just doesn't do anything for me. I do go to races, but only because my son has a team, or my grandson is driving. Or I may go to an F1 race because I have a business reason to go there.""

Fearful he would struggle to fill the void left by motorsport, the 1978 F1 world champion made a plan to cope with life after racing.

""I enjoyed my driving so much throughout my career,"" said Andretti, who raced for iconic teams such as Ferrari, Lotus and Williams. ""So I was very concerned about how I could find something that would be close enough to replace the satisfactions that I derived from driving when I retired.

""I thought my life would be very, very empty after that. I just didn't know how I could replace that. I knew there had to be an end, though, so after racing I pursued ventures which were challenging.""

Andretti won four titles in IndyCar, F1's equivalent. But not in 1992, when he crashed out of the prestigious Indianapolis 500 race

Having fled his hometown of Montona in Italy following the end of World War II - emigrating to the town of Nazareth in the United States - and spent a life in the cockpit of racing cars, Andretti was well prepared for challenging ventures.

He now owns a chain of more than 50 petrol stations, a car dealership, a clothing line, car washes, go-kart tracks, a gaming facility and his own winery. He also provided the voice for the role of himself in the Pixar animation movie Cars.

""I'm flat-out,"" Andretti added. ""There are months in my calendar where every single day is taken up. Some of it is a bit overwhelming but things keep coming my way.""

Does he have plans to ease off the gas and slow down? ""No and I'll tell you why,"" said the American, who remains the only man to have won the Daytona 500, the Indy 500 and the Formula 1 World Championship. ""When I have a lull, like a week or so, I get antsy. I have to stay active.

""I have a property 70 miles from my home where we have lots of toys like snowmobiles and boats. It's also got tennis courts, as I love playing tennis. I love water-skiing, too. But after a few days there, I get bored. I want to go back to work.""

His desire to find that next thrill does not stop at skydiving. If he hadn't become a racing driver, Andretti says he would have been a fighter pilot, so he jumped at the chance to fly a F-15 fighter plane. ""It was fabulous,"" he said. ""Just supersonic."" Another thing ticked off the list.

Andretti can sing a number of opera arias from beginning to end in Italian

Andretti still gets behind the wheel by giving rides to competition winners in a two-seater IndyCar during the build-up to races. ""It's not the real thing, but it is something at this stage of my life which is very enjoyable,"" he said.

The fight to fill the void continues, though. ""I was given the opportunity to take it to the limit in Formula 1 and I'm always thinking about how I am going to replace it,"" he said.

Will he do another skydive again? ""No, probably not,"" said Andretti, who only decided to do it after noticing the nearby skydiving centre while on site to film a commercial. ""I've already done that now.

""There are so many forms to fill in beforehand and so many disclaimers. If you paid a lot of attention, you probably wouldn't jump, so you have to let go and just do it.""","Mario Andretti the thrillseeker: Skydiving, racing and flying at 74",http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/74920000/jpg/_74920873_3363255.jpg,2014-05-30 08:33:27,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/22532808
331,"Formula 1 is introducing arguably the biggest set of rule changes in its history this season.

Most affected are the engines as the sport goes further than ever before to embrace 'green' technology.

But the appearance of the cars is changing, too.

Here, BBC Sport highlights the key things to look out for in 2014.

Engines, Ers and unreliability

First things first, the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8s, which have been in use since 2006, have been replaced by 1.6-litre V6 turbos.

After several years of a freeze on engine development, engine power will now be a performance differentiator again. And part of the new rules package is a fuel limit.

Drivers will now have to complete races on just 100kg - or about 130 litres - of fuel. That's down from the 150kg or so teams would use last year, when there was no limit. Meanwhile, engines must consume fuel at no more than 100kg per hour.

The fuel limit is not as draconian as it at first appears, though, so don't expect races to become an economy run.

The new engines don't use as much fuel for a start, while much more power is now available from the 'hybrid' technology, known as Ers.

Ers, which stands for 'energy recovery system', is made up of the Kers system that has been around for a while and a second electric motor fitted to the turbo.

The Kers system harnesses kinetic energy from the rear axle during braking via an electric motor to be stored in a battery pack reapply under acceleration. Last year, it was allowed to produce 60kw for up to 6.7 seconds a lap. This year, however, it can produce 150kw for 30 seconds.

Media playback is not supported on this device Learn the physics behind a Formula 1 car

As for the second electric motor, that will harness energy from the turbo that would otherwise be wasted as heat.

The amount of energy that can be generated in this way is unlimited and can be either stored in the battery or used to accelerate.

This electric motor also increases the efficiency of the turbo and can be used to ensure it works the instant the driver applies the throttle.

In the past, turbo engines have always had a slight throttle lag - a delay in power while the turbo gets up to speed. This has been removed in these new engines.

Drivers pushed a button to access the power stored by the Kers system, but the new Ers will be controlled by the engine management computer, so it means there is less work for the drivers to do.

All sounds good, doesn't it? But there is a price to pay.

Such dramatic changes mean reliability will be a major concern, certainly at the start of the season.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has said he believes failure rates in races could be as high as 50%.

U.G.L.Y. spells radical redesign

In addition to the changes to the engines, there are a series of changes to the cars. The effect of these will be to make the cars look different this year, even ugly.

The front nose is the source of most concern.

The new Ferrari, which will be driven be Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen

It's been lowered by 415mm for safety reasons, to just 135mm above the floor of the car.

Coupled with a complicated set of dimensional requirements, this is likely to mean cars resemble a giant anteater. This has already been seen with the new Williams, the first team to reveal the complete look of their car.

Analysis A major revision to the rules for 2014 is just what many believe Formula 1 needs next season following four years of Red Bull domination. Given the aerodynamic excellence of Adrian Newey's Red Bulls, it is no surprise that team boss Christian Horner has spoken negatively of the prospect of engines being a performance differentiator again. Not everyone agrees, though. They always used to be. And many would argue they should be. It is called motorsport, after all. The new rules will inject some much-needed uncertainty into a sport in which results have become all-too familiar, but it would be wrong to assume they will automatically mean the end of Red Bull's hegemony. New rules always favour the teams with most resources, and Newey has proven time and time again that he can exploit them better than others. Equally, efficiency will be key in 2014. And guess who had the most aerodynamically efficient car and fuel-efficient engine. Yes, Red Bull and partner Renault. That is no guarantee they will continue to do so following such major changes. But it would be foolish to presume change necessarily means they will not.

Teams could improve the appearance of the car by using 'vanity panels' that would smooth the shape of the nose but these add weight so designers will be reluctant to use them extensively.

The idea behind the new nose was to increase safety in two ways.

It will reduce the danger in incidents of T-boning, when the nose of one car hits the side of another, by making it less likely that the high nose of a car can hit a driver. And it will prevent a car from being launched into the air when it hits the rear wheels of the one in front.

It is not just the front nose that has been targeted by the FIA, which governs F1. It has also lowered the front of a car's chassis for the same reason.

However, teams want the chassis as high as possible for the best under-car aerodynamics and front-suspension geometry.

The rules dictate that the chassis in front of the driver must be 625mm above the floor of the car, and that the height of the front of the chassis by his feet - the front bulkhead - must be 525mm. But they do not define a minimum distance for the transition between these two heights.

As a result, some teams have created a vertical 10cm wall immediately after the bulkhead, which might not be aesthetically pleasing to some, although there is always the option of using 'vanity panels' to cover the resulting 'step'.

The FIA is not happy about this, as it reduces the impact of its safety-related changes, and officials had been assured by designers no team would make the 10cm height change happen over as short a distance as some now have.

There are other changes, too, all of which will have a significant impact on aerodynamics.

The front wings have been narrowed by 150mm, the lower rear beam wing has been removed and the position of the exhaust has been moved.

Sauber's new car features the 'anteater' nose

The narrower front wings mean it will be more difficult for teams to turn airflow around the outside of the front tyres, which will affect the entire car's aerodynamic downforce.

The removal of the rear beam wing prevents teams joining up the different airstreams over the rear wing and through the car's floor, which will make rear aerodynamics more critical and reduce overall downforce.

Arguably most impactful, though, are the changes to the exhaust, which will end the 'exhaust-blown floors', which have been the defining technology of the last three years.

Using exhaust gases to boost downforce was put to great use by Red Bull and was one of the central reasons for their domination of recent years.

Mandating a single, central exhaust pipe, which exits above the gearbox, means the gases can no longer be harnessed in this way.

Check the small print...

These seismic technical changes are joined by a series of tweaks to the sporting rules.

Most controversial is the decision to award double points at the final race in an attempt to prevent championships being decided early.

Vettel celebrates his fourth World Championship

The proposal, dreamt up by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, follows the recent dominance of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who has won the last four drivers' titles.

The German claimed two of those last three championships with at least three races to go.

There has also been a tweak to the penalty system.

As well the introduction of a new five-second penalty for minor offences, points will be awarded on a sliding scale depending on the misdemeanour. Any driver who racks up 12 points in a calendar year will serve an automatic race ban.

It sounds dramatic, but no driver would have been banned had the new system been in place over the last few years - even Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado, who both had incident-ridden seasons in 2012.

333,"Who would top the ultimate Formula 1 league table?

BBC Sport has examined all the data from every race between 1950 and 2013 to see if the numbers can provide an answer.

We've chosen four driver-based categories - best win ratio, most points per grand prix start, all-time total number of points scored and best pole per grand prix average - and two nationality-based categories ranked by world titles and wins.

BBC Sport's six categories Best win ratio

While statistics cannot tell the whole story they provide a fascinating insight into driver performance across the decades ahead of the season opener in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday.

Five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio comes out on top in three of the four categories, but there are also surprise findings, such as Lewis Hamilton being 10th on the list of most points per grand prix start.

When broken down by nationality, Britain tops the tables both in terms of race victories and world championships, with Germany a close second.

For the first three tables, the current points system - 25, 18, 15, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 - has been applied to every season. Only drivers with at least 20 grand prix starts have been included.

Here's the top 10 in each category, plus analysis from BBC Sport's F1 chief writer Andrew Benson and links to the complete tables.

Best win ratio RANK DRIVER NATIONALITY GP STARTS WINS WIN RATIO 1 Fangio J-M ARG 51 24 A win every 2.13 races 2 Ascari A ITA 32 13 2.46 3 Clark J GB 72 25 2.88 4 Vettel S GER 120 39 3.08 5 Schumacher M GER 306 91 3.36 6 Stewart J GB 99 27 3.67 7 Prost A FRA 199 51 3.90 8 Senna A BRZ 161 41 3.93 9 Moss S GB 66 16 4.13 10 Hill D GB 115 22 5.23

No matter how many times you hear them, Juan Manuel Fangio's Formula 1 career statistics are still gobsmacking.

Twenty-four wins in 51 races - every other race, give or take. With four different teams, over seven years. An incredible achievement. All the more so given the man did not come to Europe until he was 39.

It is no wonder that even now, 60 years after his heyday, many still regard the Argentine as the greatest racing driver that ever lived.

But this table also underlines the claim to greatness of Stirling Moss, as well as the importance of machinery in the overall statistics of F1.

Talented and determined though he was, very few experts would pick Damon Hill as one of the 10 greatest drivers in history. But there he is in 10th place, the result of spending the vast majority of his career at Williams during one of their golden eras.

It's not surprising that this list, formulated by applying the current points system, is remarkably similar to the best-win-ratio list - there are, of course, most points for a win.

But the differences are just as interesting. Lewis Hamilton, 11th on win ratio, is there in 10th place, a reflection of the excellence of his career so far. Likewise the remarkable Sebastian Vettel is even higher in this list, the result of the superlative standards he and Red Bull have set since 2009.

And there are some interesting names on it that rarely feature in F1 'best ofs' - Nino Farina, the first world champion, and Jose Froilan Gonzalez, Ferrari's first winner. They may have been overshadowed by their brilliant 1950s contemporaries Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari, but this underlines their quality.

Most striking of all is that Fernando Alonso, who holds the record for most career points based on the traditional scoring system, is not in the top 10 on a points-per-start ratio once all seasons are converted to the current system. He's not far off, though - just outside in 11th.

A telling list, this. Skewed to the modern era for two reasons - the better reliability of the cars and the increased number of races.

Alonso's appearance in third behind just Schumacher, whose points from the 1997 season have been included in the table despite him being stripped of his second place in the championship, and Alain Prost underlines the remarkable consistency he has shown in his career. Rubens Barrichello's fifth place is due to the record-breaking length of his time in F1.

And David Coulthard in eighth is a reminder that, although he wasn't on the level of Schumacher and Mika Hakkinen, the now ace broadcaster was a mean old pedaller himself over a long period.

The natural reaction is to assume that Ayrton Senna would top this but of course there's that man Fangio again.

Like Jimmy Clark, the Argentine's pole-ratio record is even more remarkable than his wins, which underlines the extent to which each dominated his era.

Sebastian Vettel is the highest modern driver but Lewis Hamilton's position just a couple of places behind him despite the superiority of Vettel's equipment over the last five years underlines why Hamilton is regarded as the out-and-out fastest of his era - and one of the fastest ever.

The headline here is buried in fifth place. Britain's 14 world titles is a remarkable achievement and one to be celebrated - how many people in the street would know that?

But comfortably the most successful country, when population is taken into account, is tiny Finland.

Germany ranks highly but this mighty nation owes its position to the remarkable success of just two men. Without Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel it would not feature at all.

Britain, Germany, Brazil - no surprises in the top three. But France's position in fourth will shock anyone who came to F1 in the last 20 years and knows nothing of what preceded it.

France invented Grand Prix racing and through the 1970s and 1980s provided a long succession of top-drawer drivers, from Francois Cevert and Jean-Pierre Beltoise through Jacques Laffite, Rene Arnoux and Didier Pironi to the brilliant Alain Prost.

But then, as the money that funded their rise dried up, so did the river of talent. And then France lost its race, too. There's something not right about that. Oh, and Spain is in 10th through the efforts of just one man - Fernando Alonso.

One of the great lessons of this exercise is to underline the dubiousness of using only statistics to back up any argument about who is the greatest racing driver of all time.

After all, which statistics do you use?

Some argue that having the most wins automatically makes Michael Schumacher the greatest ever. But on wins-per-start ratio he is 'only' fifth, behind Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Jim Clark and Sebastian Vettel.

Equally, racking up points is ultimately what win world championships, so should that list be used instead, even if that approach lacks the visceral appeal of wins?

Whichever statistics you choose, none takes into account machinery - or, to be more precise, drivers doing mesmerising things in sub-standard cars.

Many of the defining moments of F1 history have come as great drivers battled the odds in what was not the fastest car.

Statistics alone cannot explain the remarkable achievements of Gilles Villeneuve in taking two victories at twisty Monaco and Jarama in 1981 in his agricultural Ferrari, or Fernando Alonso in winning three races and almost the title in the fourth or fifth fastest car in 2012.

Statistics are an important part of an argument about the relative merits of different drivers, but they certainly cannot provide a definitive answer.

The fact is, there isn't one. And that's the fun of it.

334,"Fernando Alonso was the first major figure to voice a thought that had begun to germinate in the minds of many of those in Formula 1 through the early part of this season.

Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, Alonso said on the eve of Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, ""should be in a position to win all the races"".

With another demonstration of crushing superiority at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on Sunday, that prospect took another step closer to fruition.

Hamilton led Rosberg over the line in another close battle, and their closest rival, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, was nearly 50 seconds behind. Alonso, still hanging on to third in the championship despite a difficult weekend for Ferrari, narrowly avoided being lapped in sixth place.

Red Bull undoubtedly closed the gap on Mercedes in Spain, with upgrades to both car and Renault power-unit, but team principal Christian Horner admitted that the gap between the world champions and their likely successors was still ""about 0.6 seconds a lap"".

Did he think Mercedes could win all the races? ""It's possible but improbable,"" Horner said.

The closest any team has ever come to doing so was in 1988, when McLaren-Honda drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost won 15 of the 16 races. They were denied a clean sweep because Senna tripped up lapping a backmarker in the Italian Grand Prix after Prost had retired with an engine failure.

There are parallels between 1988 and 2014.

Then as now, a team operating at the highest level were using a turbo engine operating within a fuel restriction that was on a separate level from all its rivals.

And then as now, the out-and-out fastest driver of the era was in one of the cars, and quickly established himself as the championship favourite.

Hamilton finds himself in the Senna role; Rosberg the Prost, a driver not as exceptionally gifted but who, on the occasions he can get the car set-up to his liking, is able to challenge and sometimes beat his opponent.

In Barcelona, just as in Bahrain last month, Rosberg got himself and his car into a position in which he was faster than Hamilton. But in both races Hamilton held him off.

That's four races in a row Hamilton has beaten Rosberg and it must be starting to prey on his mind, even if the German laughed off suggestions after the race that Hamilton could ""break me down mentally"".

Among the greatest weapons in Hamilton's armoury is his ability to produce a special lap in qualifying, dragging more out of the car than seemed possible for that one, vital lap.

He did it again in Spain, despite being on the back foot, and from that moment on Rosberg was always going to find it hard to beat him, on a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult. Unless Rosberg could take the lead at the start, which he did not.

It was a slow-burner of a race, lacking the overt excitement of the Mercedes drivers' side-by-side duel in Bahrain, but no less fascinating for it.

Hamilton's radio transmissions betrayed the tension he was feeling, gave a sense of just how hard he was finding it to maintain the gap he needed to keep hold of his lead through the crucial final pit-stop period.

The victory moved Hamilton to the head of the championship for the first time. With no opposition to take points off Rosberg, it has taken four races to wipe out the 25-point hit Hamilton took when he retired from the first race of the season in Australia with an engine problem.

But the points margin is small - just three - and it is clearly going to be close between the Mercedes drivers throughout the year. The pressure will ratchet up and up with each passing race.

""Lewis is doing a super job,"" Horner said, ""but if Rosberg can get his qualifying together he is going to give him a hard time for sure.""

The battle between Hamilton and Rosberg is enough on its own for the season to remain full of interest for its duration.

But it would certainly add a fascinating extra dimension if another team could improve their performance sufficiently to mix it with the Mercedes drivers.

Red Bull are closest - and while a 0.6-second gap is undoubtedly a lot, it's a good 40% less than it was in China three weeks ago. At that rate of progress, they could catch Mercedes.

Some believe that the unique circumstances of Monaco could make it happen on a one-off basis in two weeks' time.

Jenson Button said he expected Mercedes would ""have their hands full of Red Bull"" around the streets of the Principality, because the excellence of the world champions' chassis can shine while their engine deficit will not be as critical.

Rosberg admitted it was a possibility, and Alonso said he was heading there with the ""target of making things a little more complicated for them"".

That will be a harder task for Ferrari than it will be for Red Bull, after a weekend in Spain in which they were 1.8 seconds off the pace in qualifying.

Alonso had to face another four days of questions about Ferrari's lack of pace, and he fielded them with his usual answers - yes, the gap is ""quite big"", but no I haven't given up hope of the championship.

The Spaniard faced a closer challenge from team-mate Kimi Raikkonen in Spain than he had so far this season, and in the race there was the first evidence of potential problems.

Out-qualified by Raikkonen by 0.034secs at his home grand prix, Alonso was on his tail in the first stint of the race and tried to leapfrog him with an earlier first stop, which should have been the Finn's choice as the lead driver.

The ploy failed because Alonso encountered traffic, and later he switched to a three-stop strategy - which he said was focused on what turned out to be a failed attempt to beat Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel. It left Alonso needing to catch and pass Raikkonen in the final stint.

He managed it, and afterwards Raikkonen clearly wondered what had gone on, asking his engineer who made the strategy calls, and asking why he ""seemed to be getting second choice"".

Inevitably, Raikkonen played it down in front of the media, merely saying he wanted to ""clarify"" a few things, but it was the first sign of the spikiness that many expected to emerge in the greatly anticipated battle between these two big beasts.

Drivers, though, are not Ferrari's biggest concern. New team boss Marco Mattiacci made it clear at his first race in China three weeks ago that Ferrari would ""go to the market"" if necessary to recruit new staff they felt it would improve their ability to design a competitive car.

In Spain this weekend, it emerged that they will spend what it takes to get the right person and that they may have turned their attentions again to trying to prise F1's pre-eminent designer, Adrian Newey, away from Red Bull.

Newey has turned them down on a number of occasions in the past, and has often said he feels ""paternal"" towards Red Bull, with whom he is believed to have a contract until 2017. But he admitted in Spain he needed to ""decide"" on his future at some point.

Could that mean it lies in Maranello one day in the not-too distant future?

Why he would want to go there, move away from his family in England, and try to deal with what are clearly some fairly serious issues at Ferrari is unclear. He certainly does not need the money.

336,"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton have dominated in Mercedes cars so far this season

It will be difficult to keep the relationship between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg harmonious, says four-time Formula 1 champion Alain Prost.

The 59-year-old said Mercedes bosses had asked him for advice on Hamilton and Rosberg, based on his experience with Ayrton Senna in 1988-89.

Prost famously fell out with McLaren team-mate Senna when they were battling for the title.

Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg must be more aggressive - Prost

""It is difficult to stay as friends,"" Prost said.

""In '88 with Ayrton we had quite a good relationship. So it's possible.

""But if you have only a small problem, especially inside the team, then it could start very quickly.""

""It is 20 years later and they are all talking about that; they are very aware of it,"" Prost added.

""I still have some people asking me 'what would you do'? It is very interesting because they ask me if I was in their position what would be my recommendation. I don't want to tell you what I said.""

Prost and Senna set a record when they won 15 of the 16 races between them in 1988.

Mercedes' domination has been so complete this year that many believe Hamilton and Rosberg could potentially set a new mark by winning all the races.

Hamilton has won four of the five races so far this season and Rosberg the other, in Australia when Hamilton retired. The Englishman leads the German by three points in the championship ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix. Their closest rival, Fernando Alonso of Ferrari, is already 51 points behind.

Lewis Hamilton says he wants a ""fair fight"" with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for the title this season.

Rosberg beat Hamilton to win in Monaco following a controversial qualifying incident that sealed the German's pole.

""This weekend went in a direction I wasn't expecting. I'm aware of it now. I'll make sure I'm aware in the future,"" Hamilton said.

Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton v Nico Rosberg: 'This is now a war zone'

Team boss Niki Lauda said Hamilton had accused Rosberg of going off track deliberately to ruin his pole chances.

Lauda said Rosberg, who was cleared of any wrongdoing following an investigation by race stewards, had denied this to Hamilton on Saturday.

He repeated that denial in a BBC television interview after the race on Sunday.

Rosberg's position was backed by Mercedes bosses including Lauda, the team's non-executive chairman and a three-time Formula 1 world champion.

Asked to confirm he believed Rosberg had done it deliberately, Hamilton said: ""Look, man. The weekend's done and dusted. We've got a one-two for the team. Let's just focus on moving forward. I plan to be stronger in the next race.""

He added: ""We've sat down and cleared whatever air was needed to be cleared. We've been through the data and seen what needed to be seen. I wish you guys could see it. Otherwise, we're good.

""It was a difficult weekend but what doesn't break you will make you stronger. I can only get stronger for this weekend, I think.""

Despite the tense atmosphere at the team, Hamilton said he believed he and Rosberg would be able to race against each other for the rest of the year without major incident.

""I think so,"" he said. ""I think it is running successfully. It's never going to be perfect because we're fierce competitors, so you can never expect us to be best friends and compete as fiercely as we do. But we will remain respectful I think. Or I will try to remain respectful.""

When he was told Lauda had said he expected them to have a crash together at some point, Hamilton said: ""Niki keeps saying that but I think generally we have done quite a good job up until now.

""It was as close as it could ever really be in Bahrain and we didn't crash and so I don't think that's going to be the case.""

The result in Monaco put Rosberg back into the championship lead with a four-point advantage over Hamilton.

It was the first time the German had beaten Hamilton on track in a race this season. His only previous victory came in Australia at the start of the season, when Hamilton retired with an engine problem. Hamilton won in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain.

""The team is the priority and that's what we have to keep in front. That's what I kept my priority, the team. We want to get the points for the team. I didn't do anything silly, just looked after the car.""

Rosberg said: ""It's fine. We've had discussions and the benefit we have is that we've known each other for so long. We always sit down and discuss it and then move on and that's what we're doing this weekend also.""

338,"It was the weekend when the gloves well and truly came off.

Nico Rosberg beat his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton to win the Monaco Grand Prix for the second year in a row on Sunday, but what really mattered was what had happened in qualifying the previous day.

Rosberg had run wide on his final lap on Saturday afternoon. Behind on the track, Hamilton had to back off for the caution flags waved for Rosberg's incident and his hopes of beating the German's time were gone.

Pole was secured - by fair means or foul, and Hamilton felt it was foul - and Monaco being what it is, Hamilton knew that his hopes of victory were effectively gone, too, barring a poor start by Rosberg. That didn't happen and sure enough, 78 incident-filled laps later, Hamilton followed Rosberg home.

You could cut the atmosphere with a knife in the post-race news conference.

Rosberg did his best to answer questions about his victory without exacerbating the situation, and Hamilton did his best to say nothing at all.

Even so, more interesting details about their increasingly fractious relationship came to light.

Hamilton was confronted with the knowledge, which emerged at the weekend, that on his way to victory in Spain two weeks before he had switched to an engine 'boost' mode the drivers had been forbidden from using.

He responded by saying that it did not affect the outcome of the race, and that anyway Rosberg had already done the same thing in the course of their titanic battle for victory in Bahrain last month.

Asked why he had skipped the post-qualifying engineering debrief with Rosberg, Hamilton replied: ""I went to the toilet and Nico did his big debrief before I got there, which is unusual. Usually we do it when we're both in the same room but fortunately the engineers had written down what Nico had said so I read it.""

Mercedes, it has to be said, are handling this immensely awkward situation about as well as it is possible to do so.

The team's bosses are not trying to hide the problems. Non-executive chairman Niki Lauda simply says they are ""normal"" between two drivers competing for the title in the same team, and that his job is to ""stop it getting out of hand"".

Before the race, co-team boss Toto Wolff said: ""I guess they're not happy to see each other, but if your team-mate is your main competitor for world championship he's not going to be your best friend.""

And Lauda admitted: ""This thing we have with Lewis accusing the other of doing something stupid; I tried to fix it this morning with Lewis but I couldn't.""

Did Rosberg do it deliberately? He said it was a simple error caused by pushing too hard on his final lap, which he said was brought about because his first lap, which beat Hamilton by 0.059 seconds, had been so good that he could afford to take risks with his second.

Lauda and Wolff said they believed him, and more importantly the race stewards apparently did too, their verdict being there was ""no evidence of an offence"".

But Hamilton, Lauda admitted, did not. And nor, it has to be said, did many people within the paddock, even if some said they believed Rosberg was not that kind of guy.

At least four drivers from leading teams said in private that they felt it was obvious from the behaviour of the car, and Rosberg's hand movements on the steering wheel, that he had done it deliberately. Two ex-F1 drivers agreed.

If so, he certainly did a better job of disguising it than did Michael Schumacher, when he deliberately parked his Ferrari at Rascasse in 2006 to prevent title rival Fernando Alonso from taking pole.

And the truth is, as Alonso and his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen said, only Rosberg himself truly knows.

The point, though, is not whether Rosberg's actions were planned, but whether Hamilton believes they were. And, according to Lauda, he does.

However the relationship is smoothed over in the coming days, whatever Lauda says to Hamilton to calm him down, that thought will be hard to budge from Hamilton's mind.

It will fester for the rest of the season, probably the rest of their careers. As Hamilton said: ""This weekend went a direction I wasn't expecting but it's a good experience. I'm aware of it now and I'll make sure I'm aware of it for the future.""

Where do they go from here?

Lauda admitted that he could do nothing about the two drivers' relationship continuing to be tense in the extreme. He even admitted it was possible they could end up crashing together sooner or later.

The Austrian triple world champion is famously brusque and to the point, and he provided a typically honest assessment of how the battle between the two is poised.

""One thing is clear,"" he said. ""Lewis from my point of view has a 0.1-0.2secs advantage on Nico because he can get the laps in qualifying in order. Nico is my type - working hard, with the mechanics, with the engineers, with the tyres, how many laps, forwards and backwards.

""So we have one natural talent, very emotional, and we have another guy who is doing the same job in another way. So we are in a very comfortable situation to have two different drivers but in the end they do the same speed, or the same result. So for me it is a very good situation.""

As for any dirty tricks that may or may not be employed, Lauda said: ""You have to be a bastard if you want to win in F1 anyway. No question. And you cannot win being a nice guy.

""Tell me one nice guy out there. Shall we start with Alonso? This is a breed of people who know how to focus 110% and use every trick to blow the other one off, and in the same team it's harder.

""If you get blown off by another car, it's easier. But here it is very tense and therefore everything is normal.""",Hamilton and Rosberg: On a collision course?,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75097000/jpg/_75097979_rosberg_hamilton_monaco_afp.jpg,2014-05-25 21:05:08,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/27569606

There's no two ways about it. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix last week was one of those moments that seemed to grab the attention of the wider sports community.

Maybe it was the glamour of the track in Monaco and the amazing history of the place. The boats and the blue skies make it look like paradise.

Or it might have been the build up and the idea that people were looking at something unscripted and real between me and Nico Rosberg.

By the time we were on the grid I knew we were involved in a mother of a situation, and that for the first time in a while, I was on the back foot.

Overblown rivalry

I've got to say that the whole rivalry thing with Nico has been overblown. I tweeted last week to say that we're friends and that's the way it is, and the way it always has been.

In this sport you do what you need to do to win the race. Nico was on pole and I had mission impossible in trying to get round him but everyone of those millions of people watching around the world knew that I was up for the fight. And I gave it a good shot.

Hamilton tweeted this week that he was ""still friends"" with Rosberg

Of course, all the best F1 drivers don't like losing. That's a fact. We're all here to win and people know I can't lie and pretend to be happy when I've come up short. I want to win, pure and simple.

In these moments, in the heat and noise of the battle, you can forget the bigger picture and with me I always feel better after I've slept on it. The next morning I get up and everything is still there outside my window.

The immediate emotions start to subside, a sense of rationality taps on my shoulder and I realise that it wasn't the end of the world as I thought it had been. I still had Canada and the rest of the season to look forward to!

I've had the most positive week since the last race. I've just got on with doing what I thought was right. I looked back and studied what had happened and then I took the initiative and called Nico and we buried it. Now bring on the next race.

Incredible start to season

Friendship is actually really important to me. I have a few friends away from the track, regular guys who I've known for years and who keep me grounded and sane.

It's at times like these, when things are moving fast and when you're fired up and emotional that you need your friends. It's a really good feeling to know that they're always there for you.

The team is positive about the way the season is shaping up. We've won every race so far and had five one-two finishes which is pretty incredible and that reflects the calibre of the people we have around us both in Brackley and with my own management team.

Hamilton has won four races this season, but had to settle for second in Monaco

This move to Mercedes was part of a very carefully thought-out plan and so for me personally to have had four wins and a second place so far is pretty amazing. I count my blessings every single day that I have this great opportunity this season in a great team with a great car.

Canadian support

I'm really glad to be in Canada for this latest race. It's a weekend I've always enjoyed. I had my first win in F1 here, and I just generally like coming out to this side of the world. I like almost everything about it.

I have great support in Canada. The connection with the fans is brilliant, and the whole city of Montreal feels like it's part of the race. The track is just over the bridge from the city, and everyone gets excited about it.

The crowd are great - they make the event. And I like the set-up of the circuit. It's a fantastic track to drive and it's not that big. It feels very intimate.

The circuit here seems to suit my style. I just seem to gel with the track.

Out of contract at the end of this season, the Briton, 34, believes McLaren will be stronger for their poor performances in 2013 and 2014.

""This is a great team to be with for the future,"" said Button.

""It's been a tough year - and last year was tough as well - but it's been good for the team. Things need to change and they have been changing.""

McLaren had their worst season since 1980 in 2013, failing to take a podium finish.

This season, Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen scored second and third places in the opening race in Australia but have struggled since.

The McLaren chassis is the main issue but the team's Mercedes engine, which has an advantage over the rival power-units of Ferrari and Red Bull's supplier Renault, is compensating to a degree.

Button, who won the world title in 2009, said McLaren's problems had forced them to fix fundamental weaknesses in the team.

""When you get a hit like this and suddenly you're not so competitive, you look to change big things that have been the same for many years, even 20 years,"" said the Englishman.

""It's a very positive direction the team is going in now, so I'm excited about the future.""

McLaren are starting a new engine partnership with Honda next season.

The Japanese manufacturer, which is returning to the sport for the first time since disbanding its team at the end of 2008, is behind with plans for its new engine, according to insiders, but Button wants to stay put.

""I do see my future with McLaren,"" he said.

Button also said it was ""not the right time"" to start discussing a new deal.

""No progress, but that is the way it is,"" he said. ""We have spent four good years together already, we are in our fifth year together and we both want to work together in the future.

""We have a lot of other issues to solve first before we start to think about the future too much.

""I still feel very young at heart, fitter than ever, and I have all that experience. I am in a great position.

McLaren have gone 23 races without a win - their worst run since 2003-04

""I have a lot more to give in the future in F1 and I definitely cannot see an end to my career. This is where I want to be in my future.""

McLaren would like Button to stay, but they potentially have other options.

Magnussen, 21, has enjoyed a generally impressive start to his first season in F1, while the team have another highly-rated youngster in reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne, a 22-year-old from Belgium.

Ron Dennis, chairman and chief executive officer of McLaren, has also said he would have no objection to a return by Fernando Alonso, despite their difficult relationship when the Spaniard drove for the team in 2007.

Alonso, arguably the best overall driver in F1, is contracted to Ferrari until 2016, but is having a fifth frustrating season with the Italian team.

341,"Formula 1 is poised to reduce the number of practice sessions at grands prix next year.

Bosses are planning to run one session on Fridays rather than the current two, and hold it late in the afternoon.

The idea is primarily that of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who believes a later practice session would enable more people to attend after work.

It is being presented as a cost-cutting move as part of a wider programme to help struggling teams.

The plan would not only save on running costs - it costs about 1,000 euros a lap to run an F1 engine - but also reduce hotel bills as personnel could arrive at races a day later.

It would also help teams and engine companies to comply with a new rule next year that will reduce the maximum number of engines that can be used in a season from five to four.

Canadian GP schedule First Practice: 15:00 Friday

Second Practice: 19:00 Friday

Final Practice: 15:00 Saturday

Qualifying: 18:00 Saturday

Race: 19:00 Sunday

The decision has been approved by the rule-making strategy group, which comprises six leading teams - Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Lotus - as well as Ecclestone and Jean Todt, president of governing body the FIA.

It will be adopted if approved by the world motorsport council of governing body the FIA. This is usually a rubber-stamping exercise if the strategy group agrees on an idea.

Currently, there are two 90-minute practice sessions on Fridays, with one usually at 10:00-11:30 local time and the other at 14:00-15:30, although times vary at some races depending on the wider weekend timetable.

Prior to that there is a set-up day on Thursdays, on which media interviews are held as part of the build-up to the weekend. Many personnel arrive on the Wednesday ahead of a Sunday race to ensure they are ready to work first thing on Thursday morning.

Holding just one Friday practice session in the later afternoon at races would mean that many personnel could arrive a day later than they do now.

Sources say the idea is to abandon Thursdays altogether and run the preview interviews on Friday mornings before practice.

The proposal is one of a number of planned amendments to the sporting regulations aimed at keeping costs down.

Plans for a budget cap were abandoned earlier this year, although the smaller teams outside the strategy group are still keen for it to go ahead and have threatened to take F1 to the European Commision to sort the problem out.

Several of the smaller teams are struggling to find the money to run competitively.

Force India technical director Andrew Green said he was opposed to the idea because it would stop the practice of smaller teams attracting third drivers who bring sponsorship in return for mileage in first practice, as Force India have in the past and Sauber and Caterham are doing this season.

""If we lose that, it's going to be a relatively severe blow, which in turn will have an impact on our technical ability, so in that respect I don't think it's cost-saving.""

Mercedes executive director [technical] Paddy Lowe said the ""rationale is to reduce the workload on the cars significantly through the weekend and also to reduce the consumption of parts, particularly power units, which is one of the major costs for all the teams.""

He added: ""It's still to be finalised, by the way, so there's a whole month in order to determine the small print ands to finally approve it. If the teams are feeling it isn't going to save money, then of course it could be reviewed.""

Hamilton has since phoned Rosberg to resolve the issue ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.

Lowe runs the technical and sporting sides of the Mercedes F1 team, while Mercedes sports boss Toto Wolff looks after the business and political aspects.

Talking to BBC Radio 5 live, Lowe said: ""The great thing is they're both mature guys.

""They're very competitive, which is why sometimes there is friction. They have had various conversations with each other over the last 10 days, unprompted by any of the management and have come back here in great shape.

""The main point is what happens on the track.

Media playback is not supported on this device Marvellous Montreal: Canada F1 preview

""There were various issues in Monaco that one might describe as relationship issues, but there were no team or technical issues.""

Lowe said he and Wolff had always been clear with the drivers that they would be allowed to race freely this season.

""Toto and I sat down with both drivers before Australia and laid out what we wanted if the car was in a position to win races, we wanted them both to have an equal chance and we weren't going to control the race,"" Lowe said.

""It was very important they could race each other without instructions or commands to hold position because that is unsatisfactory.

""We have a bit of paper with various strategies written down and that's what we work to. You always have to have these rules of engagement between the two drivers.

""A good example is qualifying. There is a very second-order difference in the order you may run in Q3.

""It's not always best to go last but it can be best to go last. You might decide it's best to go first.

""To make it fair we alternate who has the choice as to which order they want to run from race to race. That's an example of a rule we have and then it's very clear for each driver.""

The track, which first held the race in 1978 and has since missed only two years, has a new contract until 2024.

As part of the long-term arrangement, organisers will invest $32m (£17.4m) in upgrading the track's facilities.

The paddock, one of the most cramped on the calendar, is to be improved and a new grandstand built.

The news of an extended contract will be welcomed in F1. The race is one of the most popular on the calendar - and, as one of only two events in North America, an important one from a global marketing perspective as well.

Following qualifying, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton said of the news: ""It's one of the best races of the year, but mostly the fans here are some of the best that we get to see. They really make the atmosphere and the city is incredible, great food, we enjoy coming here.""

Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel added: ""It's one of the few places in the calendar where the whole city really parties all weekend long and embraces the grand prix and obviously for us that's a great feeling.""

Mayor Denis Coderre said: ""This is a positive outcome for Montreal.

""The Canadian Grand Prix is part and parcel of Montreal, one of the big international events that builds our outstanding reputation as one of the world's great cities.""

344,"Red Bull design chief Adrian Newey will no longer concentrate solely on Formula 1 as part of a new deal that keeps him with the company.

It is potentially a huge shift for the team which dominated F1 from 2010-13.

Newey is the most successful F1 car designer in history and masterminded the team's four consecutive world title doubles with Sebastian Vettel.

Red Bull say Newey will ""work on new projects, as well as advising and mentoring the F1 team"".

Team principal Christian Horner declined to say exactly what that meant for the F1 team, insisting Newey was ""still very much involved"".

But Newey said he was taking a ""step back"" from F1.

""I've been in motor racing since I graduated,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It's been a fantastic experience, it's what I've always wanted to do but now I feel it is time to take on some fresh challenges as well. I want to keep motivating myself.

""What I'd like to do is step back and become an adviser and mentor to the engineers.

""We'll look at the engineering structure we have now and renew the team later in the year and that will give me the space to get on with some other things.""

Horner downplayed the importance of the shift in Newey's role.

Newey's Red Bull career 2006: Joined Red Bull Technology 2009: Second in the Formula 1 Constructors' World Championship 2010: Red Bull lands nine wins and 498 points to take the Constructors' crown. Sebastian Vettel claims the team's first Drivers' title at the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP 2011: Red Bull takes 12 wins, 27 podiums and 18 poles. and wins the Constructors' Championship with four races remaining. Sebastian Vettel retains the Drivers' title 2012: Red Bull wins third consecutive constructors' crown and Sebastian Vettel won a third consecutive world drivers' title 2013: Red Bull wins fourth Constructors' Championship and Sebastian Vettel wins the F1 drivers title for the fourth time

""We've got tremendous strength in depth,"" Horner said. ""It's not like he's not going to be about anymore so it's great for the team, Red Bull and for him.""

Horner added: ""We'll have a further clarification a bit later in the summer.""

The move keeps Newey out of the grasp of Red Bull's F1 rivals - Ferrari are reputed to have made a big-money offer to him this season - but could mean Red Bull will have to re-organise the process by which they design and develop their F1 cars.

The team are built around Newey in a way that has successfully allowed him to concentrate on the creative aspects of car design without being bogged down in management.

A team of senior engineers works closely with him to deal with the management aspects of the design office.

Newey sketches up the fundamental concept of the car before handing it on to the wider design team to process, and is integrally involved in its development.

The result was four consecutive drivers' and constructors' titles doubles from 2010-13.

Red Bull have not yet explained how his shift to focus on other activities as well will impact on that process.

They have been unable to keep pace with the dominant Mercedes team this year, but their lack of performance is entirely down to the under-powered Renault engine.

The Red Bull chassis is considered to be at least the equal of the Mercedes, and unquestionably better in the amount of high-speed downforce it creates.

Before joining Red Bull, Newey won titles with Williams and McLaren. He is responsible for the overall design concept of the cars that won the drivers' world title in 1992, 1993, 1996, 1998, 1998 and 1999.",Red Bull's Adrian Newey shifts sole focus from Formula 1,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75383000/jpg/_75383247_adrian1.jpg,2014-06-08 15:17:14,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/27755688

But he dismissed widespread doubts within F1 the plan could be a success.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo passed Nico Rosberg's struggling Mercedes with two laps to go to win his first race in a thrilling Canadian Grand Prix.

Rosberg held on to take second ahead of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, helped by a last-lap safety car following a crash between Sergio Perez and Felipe Massa.

Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Huge crash for Massa and Perez ends race

Rosberg's team-mate Lewis Hamilton retired with a brake failure and is now 22 points behind in the championship.

McLaren's Jenson Button stunningly took fourth with a late charge.

The Englishman passed Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the penultimate lap.

It was a sensational end to a race that was full of incident and tension, as Mercedes' early season domination of Formula 1 came to an end in the most remarkable of circumstances.

The first part of the race ran to form, with Rosberg narrowly ahead of Hamilton as the two Mercedes drove off into a race of their own.

Rosberg held on through the first pit stops but was quickly closed down by Hamilton thereafter.

Both Felipe Massa (pictured) and Sergio Perez were taken to hospital for precautionary brain scans after sustaining impacts of 27G, but have since been discharged

But just as the Englishman appeared to be setting up to pass his team-mate for the lead both cars suffered a simultaneous loss of hybrid power from the engine.

Hamilton took the lead during the second pit-stop period after Rosberg was delayed by a problem fitting a front wheel at his stop.

But on the very next lap Hamilton ran wide at the hairpin, a symptom of the total brake failure he was about to experience at the next corner.

That put Rosberg back into the lead and although Perez closed up, closely tracked by the Red Bulls, he was unable to pass, as he too was managing fading brakes.

But with Rosberg just managing to hold off Perez and the Red Bulls, Ricciardo began to apply pressure to the Mexican, and passed him around the outside into Turn One with four laps to go.

The Australian, who joined Red Bull at the start of this season and has generally had the measure of his four-time world champion team-mate, quickly closed on Rosberg and passed him down the long final straight on lap 68 of 70.

""I'm still in shock. This is ridiculous,"" said Ricciardo. ""The race really came to life the last 15, 20 laps. We saw Hamilton had a problem and then Rosberg was slow on the straights.

""I was struggling to get past Perez and we finally got a run out of the last chicane and got him into Turn One and then a couple of laps to go I found myself in the right spot to get the DRS. Amazing.""

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: ""Amazing, the boy's driven brilliantly all year. The move of the race was around the outside of Perez a few laps from the end.""

The race came to an abrupt end at the start of the final lap when Massa misjudged an attempt to pass Perez and his Williams crashed into the Mexican's Force India as they braked for the first corner.

The two cars narrowly missed hitting Vettel's Red Bull as they spun into heavy impacts with the tyre wall.

Both were taken to hospital for precautionary brain scans after sustaining impacts of 27G, but have since been discharged.

In the excitement, it was not immediately clear how Button, who was eighth with six laps to go, passed both Hulkenberg and Alonso for fourth.

Williams' Valtteri Bottas took seventh, ahead of the Toro Rosso of Jean-Eric Vergne, Kevin Magnussen's McLaren and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.

Jenson Button said his McLaren team should be happy with their points return from the Canadian Grand Prix after he finished fourth.

Button, 34, produced an inspired drive to make up four places in the final two laps, helped by a crash involving Sergio Perez and Felipe Massa.

""It was a fun race and reasonable points. We did a good job,"" he said.

Team-mate Kevin Magnussen finished ninth behind winner Daniel Ricciardo.

Button spent much of a dramatic race at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve caught in traffic following an early change of tyres.

But with Lewis Hamilton among a number of drivers failing to finish, the 2009 world champion worked his way through the field before going past both Fernando Alonso and Nico Hulkenberg on the penulitmate lap.

Button, who claimed 12 points to move up to seventh in the drivers' championship, added: ""I fought my way through at the end.

""I had a little dice with Fernando and Nico [Hulkenberg]. Fernando almost hit Nico at the hairpin and had to dive down the inside. Then they both ran wide and I got down the inside of both of them.

""On the final lap, you never want to see an accident like Felipe and Checo's but, fortunately, they both got out of their cars OK, which was good.

""There were incidents and we gained positions because of that, but the important thing there is a better feel to the car.

""The team did a good job and made the best of what we had. We should be happy to get some good points and move on from this and have a better race in Austria.""

Jenson Button has previous when it comes to cutting through the field at Canada. The Briton won the rain-delayed 2011 race after starting from seventh on the grid and falling to last place early on.

The crash involving Force India's Perez and Williams driver Massa also promoted Alonso but the Ferrari driver admitted that his sixth place finish and 10th spot for team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was still not good enough.

However, Alonso believes Ferrari can take inspiration from the performance of Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel, who finished third, in their Red Bulls.

""The car did improve a little bit compared with the last race but others did a bigger step than us,"" said the double world champion.

""We need to work better but Red Bull are an example now. After winter testing no-one would have thought they would win a race, especially in the first half of the season. But it just shows how things can change in Formula 1.""

Force India's Hulkenberg said: ""I am not too disappointed after finishing fifth. It was a tough race, different from everyone else because we were pulling off a one-stop strategy.

""We would have finished in the points regardless [of the crash]. We lost too much at the start because we had clutch issues and then you are playing catch-up all the time.""

Vettel narrowly avoided being caught up in the collision as the defending world champion equalled his best finish for the season in a Red Bull revival.

""In the end I was lucky. Felipe and Sergio crashed and nearly took me out. At the last second I saw them in my mirror and was able to react,"" he said.

""I'm happy for Ricciardo and the team. We still have work to do but after the winter we had it was nice to break through and capitalise when the Mercedes had problems.""

The tone for an incident-packed race was set in the opening lap when Marussia team-mates Max Chilton and Jules Bianchi collided, forcing the safety car to come out and ending their involvement.

And Chilton, 23, was not too impressed at seeing his record of finishing in every race of his F1 career come to an end.

""I am not too happy,"" he said. ""We were side by side going into three and I braked at the point going into the corner. To my surprise he braked too late but it looks like I hit him.

Lewis Hamilton says he needs a run of victories to recover lost ground in the championship following retirement from the Canadian Grand Prix.

Hamilton suffered brake failure while leading and is now 22 points behind team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished second.

It was Hamilton's second retirement in seven races; Rosberg has none.

""I'm two DNFs down; that's almost 50 points I've lost. I'm going to have to recover them somewhere else,"" he said.

Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Lewis Hamilton disappointed with retirement

""[A run of wins] is what I'm going to have to do. But we've got lots of races ahead of us so let's hope there is more good fortune to come in the future.""

Mercedes failed to win a race for the first time this season after both cars were crippled by a failure of their hybrid power system about halfway through the race.

Rosberg led Hamilton from the start but the Englishman took the lead when his team-mate was delayed at his second pit stop, only for Hamilton to suffer rear brake failure on the next lap.

The brake problem was almost certainly influenced by the hybrid failure, as the energy recovery system slows the car down and takes some strain off the brakes as it harvests power on corner entry.

Rosberg nursed his car to the finish, holding on in the lead at the head of a four-car train until two laps from the end, when he was passed by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.

Hamilton said: ""We knew as a team we had some issues some part through our second stint, but we thought we'd be OK to manage it.

""I jumped him in the stop and I was thinking, wow finally what an amazing feeling and then suddenly the brakes failed. There was nothing I could do.

""Every point will [matter]. That's two DNFs for me and none for Nico but these are learning experiences, we will learn as a team and get stronger and I'm sure we won't have another incident like today when we were both at risk.""

This season, Hamilton was faced with an immediate 25-point deficit when he retired with an engine problem from the first race in Australia.

He made up the gap and took the lead of the championship with four straight wins, but went into Canada four points down on Rosberg, following the German's win in the previous race in Monaco.

349,"Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Daniel Ricciardo wins maiden race in thriller

Montreal weaved its magic again, and this time it cast its unique spell on the man with a smile as wide as the St Lawrence Seaway.

Daniel Ricciardo wears the pressures of Formula 1 lightly. Not a minute seems to go by when the sunny Australian does not have a big, sparkling white grin on his face, and his maiden grand prix victory was greeted with universal delight in a sport that has taken him to its heart.

The 24-year-old changed his travel plans on Sunday night so he could celebrate his win in the style it deserved.

""I'm actually supposed to fly back tonight,"" he said, ""but I don't know if I want to spend the night of my first victory on a plane, so we will see what happens.""

Doubtless he blew the froth off a few, as they say in his home country, and there are few better places to do that than the city that hosts what is arguably F1's most popular race.

Everyone loves going to Montreal, for the buzzing vibe and the great race track that was built 36 years ago on the lovely little Ile Notre Dame in the middle of Quebec's forbidding river.

It doesn't look much on paper, this place, just a few chicanes and a couple of hairpins joined by straights. But the layout belies the challenge of one of F1's toughest tracks, just as Ricciardo's smile hides a steely core.

Montreal lived up to its reputation for producing one of the best races of the season, but going into the weekend few would have predicted Ricciardo would win it.

This was not a circuit where his Red Bull team expected to excel - their Renault engine is way down on power on the standard-setting Mercedes, leaving the car breathless on those long blasts between the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve's concrete walls.

But Ricciardo's team-mate Sebastian Vettel, the world champion, qualified in third, with Ricciardo a disappointed sixth, only 0.041secs behind, and feeling he had left 0.3secs out on the track on a ""scrappy"" lap.

It was only the second time in seven races that the four-time champion had managed to be ahead of his inexperienced team-mate on the grid, a statistic which of itself says an awful lot about the impact Ricciardo has made this year. His race on Sunday said a lot more.

Both Red Bull drivers felt a decent result was possible, but neither expected to challenge the dominant Mercedes cars. And for its first half the grand prix ran to form, Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton running away with it at the front, as the silver cars have at every race so far this season.

But then the Mercedes ran into problems, both cars losing their hybrid systems at the same time, robbing them of 160bhp. Shortly thereafter, Hamilton lost his brakes, and Rosberg was alone out front, vulnerable, his pursuers eating into his lead.

Ricciardo, though, still had a lot of work to do before the race surrendered itself to him. There were two key moments in his afternoon.

The first was when he jumped Vettel at their second pit stops, despite stopping a lap later, normally a disadvantage.

This, team boss Christian Horner said, was down to ""the combination of a slow-ish out lap [by Vettel] and a very quick in lap. Daniel really did the damage on his in-lap.""

That meant it was Ricciardo, rather than Vettel, who was the Red Bull driver challenging Force India's Sergio Perez in the second half of the race - and therefore he who was in third place, with the scent of victory in his nostrils, when Perez caught Rosberg's struggling Mercedes with 20 laps to go.

Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Huge crash for Massa and Perez ends race

Hamstrung by the Red Bull's lack of power, Ricciardo struggled behind Perez for 16 laps before the second key moment arrived.

On lap 65, Ricciardo was that bit closer to the Mexican down the long back straight, got a good run on him out of the last chicane, and passed him with a high-quality move around the outside into Turn One. From then on, Rosberg was at his mercy, and he duly passed him on the penultimate lap.

It was a racer's win, taken with an opportunistic verve befitting a man who has impressed everyone involved since he stepped up to Red Bull for this season after two and a half years learning the ropes down the grid.

There were those who questioned Red Bull's decision to promote Ricciardo to replace the departing Mark Webber for this year. After all, former world champion Kimi Raikkonen was available and keen - and even double champion Fernando Alonso had expressed an interest last summer even though he was under contract to Ferrari.

But Red Bull preferred to promote from within, and how that decision has paid off.

While Raikkonen has struggled at Ferrari this year, completely put in the shade by Alonso, Ricciardo has thrived at Red Bull, to the extent that now the questions are all about Vettel, not the new boy.

Other than in Malaysia, Ricciardo has consistently out-performed the German, who entered the season on the back of four straight titles. In the process, Ricciardo has established himself as a potential champion himself.

Vettel has certainly had the vast majority of any reliability problems Red Bull have had, but fundamentally Ricciardo has flat beaten him out on the race track.

On and off the track, meanwhile, he has handled himself with class and style.

In the races in Bahrain and China when he was quicker than Vettel but held up behind him, Ricciardo calmly got on the radio and said the team had to make a decision. They did - to order Vettel to let his team-mate by.

The German made his unhappiness about it clear, but Ricciardo dodged with aplomb the inevitable provocative questions afterwards, choosing to avoid politics and let his driving doing the talking. And all the while that smile has remained in place.

Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Lewis Hamilton disappointed with retirement

Red Bull have made no secret of the fact that, after the poison of Vettel's relationship with Webber, Ricciardo's presence in the team has been a joy.

Part of the reason they signed him was that they felt that, as a driver who had been groomed for F1 from an early age by the Red Bull system, he would be a less disruptive influence in the team than an experienced star.

That decision was based on the belief that Vettel - who they felt was the best driver in the world - would probably beat anyone they signed. Better, then, to have someone who felt beholden to them in the other car so he would not rock the boat.

But Ricciardo's consistent excellence has surprised Red Bull, and everyone else along with them.

After more than a decade, Formula 1 returns to Austria this weekend, and Lewis Hamilton will be desperate to get his title challenge back on track.

The Mercedes driver retired for the second time this season in Canada while his team-mate Nico Rosberg finished second to extend his lead in the drivers' standings to 22 points.

Only four drivers currently on the grid - Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button, Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa - have raced at the track before.

So can Hamilton master the circuit quicker than team-mate Rosberg and start to close that gap before the championship moves to his home race at Silverstone?

Jenson Button is one of only four on the grid to have raced in Austria. Fernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa are the others

Reasons to watch the Austrian Grand Prix

The Red Bull Ring is an old-school, narrow track that features an exciting run uphill to Turn One followed by a sequence of tricky turns.

Mercedes will hope to have got on top of their power-unit problems, while Hamilton will want to put a dent in team-mate Rosberg's championship lead.

Williams aim to fulfil the potential of what is a quick car, Marussia will hope their drivers don't take each other out again while Pastor Maldonado will simply want a reliable Lotus.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo will look to build on his Canadian Grand Prix success, Sebastian Vettel will bid to beat his team-mate for the first time in five races and McLaren will hope for another stroke of luck.

What makes the Austrian Grand Prix different?

Nestled in the region of Austria's Styrian mountains, the newly-named Red Bull Ring features a relatively short and very quick lap.

The Spielberg track has changed since its creation as the high-speed Osterreichring in 1969. The new track is smaller and more intricate but retains the undulations that characterised the original.

The venue was bought by Red Bull drinks company owner (and owner of Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso) Dietrich Mateschitz and brought up to date before being renamed as the Red Bull Ring.

The track has hosted the Austrian Grand Prix 25 times - between 1970-1987 and 1997-2003 - with Michael Schumacher the last driver to triumph there for Ferrari.

The Austrian GP first ran in 1964. This year's race is 71 laps long - the fastest lap is held by Michael Schumacher, set in 2003 for Ferrari

Its location in the Austrian Alps means that the weather conditions can change rapidly, which could give added spice to the event.

An Austrian Grand Prix flashback

Analysis ""The site just outside the town of Knittelfeld that is this year hosting the return of the Austrian Grand Prix to the Formula 1 calendar used to be the home of one of the all-time great race tracks. ""The Osterreichring was a high-speed rollercoaster ride through the picturesque Styrian mountains, a challenge and spectacle to rival any in the world. ""The circuit on which F1 will race in Austria for the first time since 2003 has the same basic shape, but has been slowed dramatically to satisfy the higher safety demands of the modern age. ""This layout - previously known as the A1-Ring - held a grand prix from 1997-2003, and has been revived by new owners Red Bull, whose owner Dietrich Mateschitz hails from the area. ""No longer the heart-in-mouth, buttock-clenching test of old, it is a fun little track with a couple of decently fast corners that tended to produce interesting races in front of large crowds of raucous spectators, many of whom camp out for the weekend. ""In that sense, it is an old-school European race, the sort which has become increasingly out of fashion in F1. Red Bull's deep pockets have revived this example of a dying breed.""

The 1982 Austrian Grand Prix proved to be a race of firsts and lasts as Elio de Angelis took his maiden victory in what turned out to be the last win by a Colin Chapman-built Lotus.

Nelson Piquet led away from pole position before the Brabham driver was passed by team-mate Riccardo Patrese on lap two.

Piquet then created history when he made the first planned modern day F1 pit stop for fuel and tyres, rejoining in fourth place.

Patrese suffered an engine failure, handing the lead to Renault's Alain Prost. The Frenchman then went about building a big lead while De Angelis moved into second.

But with just five laps to go, Prost retired with mechanical failure, allowing De Angelis to inherit the lead.

That set up a thrilling final few laps as Keke Rosberg in the Williams, who had also yet to win a race by this point, set about closing down a 10-second gap.

By the last lap, Rosberg was just 1.6 seconds behind and as they ran up the hill towards the final corner, De Angelis took the inside defensive line with Rosberg on his gearbox.

But that meant the Italian was forced to take a tight entry into the final corner, sending him wide on the exit and allowing Rosberg to pull alongside on the home straight.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said it felt ""weird"" to take his maiden Formula 1 win at the Canadian Grand Prix.

The Australian, who joined Red Bull after two years with feeder team Toro Rosso, passed Mercedes' Nico Rosberg for the lead with two laps to go.

""I pictured myself as a kid standing up on top of the podium and when you're up there it feels a bit weird,"" he said.

""It sounds awesome. Really good, terrific. Still seems a bit surreal, just because it happened so quickly.""

Ricciardo was third with seven laps to go, before passing Force India's Sergio Perez and then the crippled Mercedes of Nico Rosberg to take the win.

Rosberg was hampered by a failure of his engine's hybrid system, which cost him 160bhp. The same problem led to brake failure on team-mate Lewis Hamilton's car with 24 laps to go.

""It's not that we were leading the whole race, so it's not that I had time to understand that I was going to win,"" Ricciardo said.

""It all happened in the last few laps, so I think that's why it's still taking a while to comprehend in my head.

""But really nice, a really good feeling. The race came to life at the end. Mercedes had their issues and it enabled us to close on them.""

The victory came in only Ricciardo's seventh race for world champions Red Bull, and was the first time the dominant Mercedes had been beaten this season.

""I think it surprised us, yes, because of the pace Mercedes has had all year,"" he said.

""Obviously I'm still going to take the victory, don't get me wrong but they had their issues today which allowed us to really make an attack. But it's nice that we capitalised on that.

""I think it would have been disappointing if they had their issues and they were able to still get the best of us.

The 24-year-old became only the fourth Australian to win a grand prix, following in the footsteps of Sir Jack Brabham, who died last month aged 88, 1980 world champion Alan Jones and Mark Webber, whose seat Ricciardo took following his move to endurance racing.

""It's going to take a little bit to sink in, but I'm so very proud - great to hear the Aussie anthem,"" he said.

Ricciardo added that the key move was when he was able to pass Sergio Perez's Force India for second place.

Rosberg was leading a four-car train comprising Perez, Ricciardo and the second Red Bull of world champion Sebastian Vettel after losing ground when he lost his hybrid power with half the race still to go.

But Perez was unable to pass Rosberg and Ricciardo spent 28 laps behind the Mexican, whose Mercedes engine had more power than Red Bull's Renault, before managing to pass him on the outside into Turn One.

""That was the one,"" Ricciardo said. ""I could see it in front. When Nico was there and Perez was in between us. I was like, 'If we can just get Perez, I think we'll be able to make a charge on Nico.'

""I knew if I could get past Perez the race was mine to take. I was looking at the grass there between Turn One and Two and thought I'd overshot it but then I could see Nico and was able to get him with two laps to go.

""That's why it's surreal. When you hear athletes say they can't believe it, it sounds like they all say the same thing, but it's true.""

Ricciardo delayed his celebrations on the podium until he heard that Perez and Williams' Felipe Massa had not been injured in a huge crash at the start of the final lap.

""I wasn't sure if the two drivers on the last lap were OK, so I just wanted to make sure they were cool before we got celebrating, but I believe they're fine,"" Ricciardo said.

Williams driver Felipe Massa criticised Force India's Sergio Perez for his part in a spectacular crash involving the pair at Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix.

Perez, 24, has been given a five-place grid penalty for the next GP in Austria on 22 June for the incident, that led to both drivers being taken to hospital.

""It was dangerous and we could have had a very serious accident, so for me the penalty is not enough,"" said Massa, 33.

Perez denies any wrongdoing and says he cannot understand Massa's manoeuvre.

The Mexican said he was following the same line as in previous laps and ""just got hit from behind"".

He added: ""I watched several replays of the incident and I can't help but notice how Felipe turns right just before he hits me.

""I can only think he must have changed his mind and wanted to rejoin the racing line. His misjudgement cost us a big amount of points.""

Force India were frustrated by Massa's comments and aired Perez's views on Twitter

Perez was punished for deviating from his line when braking on the final lap at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as the pair battled for fourth place behind race winner Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull.

Force India tweeted a series of pictures with arrows to highlight the movements of both drivers, saying they were ""compelled to reply"" to criticism.

After sustaining impacts of 27G, both drivers were assessed at the track medical centre and then airlifted to hospital before they were released after precautionary checks.

Massa said he spoke to Perez at the medical centre to tell him he was ""so disappointed"", adding the Mexican ""needs to learn"".

He said: ""It's not the first time he turned into somebody under braking. He has done this many times, but he didn't say anything. He just turned and left.""

Both Felipe Massa (pictured) and Sergio Perez were taken to hospital for precautionary brain scans

Force India were also criticised for not retiring Perez's car when the driver signalled via radio that his rear brakes were not functioning.

353,"Did Mercedes' policy of letting their drivers race freely cost them the Canadian Grand Prix? It is, at least, a fair question.

One of the defining points of my career was the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, when I was ordered to let my McLaren team-mate Mika Hakkinen through to win because of a pre-race agreement we had with the team.

It was the first race of the season and we had a big advantage over the rest of the field, but we knew the cars would probably not finish if we raced them flat out. So the deal was that whoever got to the first corner first would win the race. That was Mika.

Coulthard finished second to Hakkinen in Australia in 1998 because of a pre-race agreement

He ended up behind me at one point after going into the pits by mistake, and afterwards team boss Ron Dennis ordered me to let him past. It hurt at the time, but it guaranteed the team a one-two.

Mercedes have had strong reliability so far this season, but Montreal has always been marginal on brakes, and if you have two cars racing hard all the time, then that puts more pressure on them.

This year, the rear brakes are smaller than in the past because a lot of the braking load is taken by the energy recovery system on the rear axle. But if the hybrid system stops working - as it did on both Mercedes in Montreal as a result of overheating - then that puts a lot more strain on the brakes.

In many ways, you would think it was inevitable at that point that they would have brake failure.

Yet when that happened, around lap 35, Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton continued to race flat out, with reduced power from their engine as a result of the hybrid failure.

Ten laps later, after his brakes had heated up in a pit stop, Hamilton's did fail and Mercedes said it was purely luck that the same thing did not happen to Rosberg as well.

Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton v Nico Rosberg: 'This is now a war zone'

That's perfectly feasible. I know from my own experience that things like that can happen. Sometimes it is just the luck of the racing gods.

As it was, Rosberg had to drive for the rest of the race not only with 160bhp less from his engine, but looking after his brakes as well, by braking earlier and with less pressure.

That gave us a great race for the last 25 laps - and a new winner in Daniel Ricciardo - but it meant Mercedes failed to win a grand prix for the first time this year.

It will be interesting to see whether that changes Mercedes' approach if a similar situation, when reliability is marginal, arises later in the season.

Hamilton's retirement has given him a lot of work to do in the drivers' championship; he is now 22 points behind Rosberg.

That's not good for him, obviously, but there are two things with which he can reassure himself.

One is that there are double points at the last race. The other is that, while Rosberg is leading the championship, it is fair to say that the stronger driver over the first seven races has been Hamilton.

If the team are not criticising him for influencing the failures in Melbourne and Montreal - and they are not - then we have to assume he has done nothing wrong.

Hamilton has been the faster, hungrier driver, so he just has to hold it together and keep chipping away.

A new star is born

Ricciardo benefited from Mercedes' misfortune to take an excellent maiden victory. There is no doubt that he has been the breakthrough star of the season.

Ricciardo won his maiden grand prix after being disqualified from a second-place finish in Australia

It is always difficult to show well in a mid-grid team, but Ricciardo showed consistently well in the Toro Rosso in 2012 and 2013 and that was part of the stimulus in promoting him to Red Bull when there were more established drivers sniffing around.

He's been part of the Red Bull family for years, so it's not like he is joining a new team. For Ricciardo, it has been the perfect transition into the big time.

That's why he has been looking so happy. It's all new for him.

They had a bad time in winter testing - but that was the first time that had happened to him.

He was disqualified in Melbourne after finishing second, but he had still been on the podium in front of his home fans.

Media playback is not supported on this device Canadian GP: Daniel Ricciardo wins maiden race in thriller

He can take all these first-time punches on the chin, and that has allowed him to have a clarity of thought and enthusiasm to get on and drive the car.

That's a different position from his team-mate Sebastian Vettel, who Ricciardo has consistently out-shone.

Vettel is used to winning. He doesn't like the new formula, with reduced downforce and turbo hybrid engines. And he has also had the lion's share of Red Bull unreliability.

It was a fortunate victory in some ways for Ricciardo, in terms of the way it unfolded for Mercedes, but he had to work for it, too. And no-one in the paddock - teams, pundits, journalists, whatever - would say he did not deserve it.

There has been a flair and hunger to Ricciardo's driving this year. Ricciardo is the real deal; a world champion in waiting.

Close call on Perez penalty

Force India's Sergio Perez will be penalised at the next race in Austria after his crash with Williams' Felipe Massa (pictured) left the pair hospitalised

It was a hard decision to hit Sergio Perez with a five-place grid penalty at the next race for causing the big crash between his Force India and Felipe Massa's Williams at the start of the last lap, but the stewards must have had a good reason to make it.

From the initial television footage, it was not clear what had happened. In fact, it looked a bit like Massa might have made a misjudgement, even if it is the sort of error he tends not to make.

But the stewards have access to the data from the cars, static cameras on the track, in-car footage and so on. Teams can make their own representations for prosecution and defence.

There is a rule that says a driver defending his position can make one move, before the braking zone. If it looks like Perez deviated from what would be his normal line while on the brakes, even in a minor way, he has to be penalised.

This is not a referee blowing the whistle in the heat of the moment for a penalty. This is the stewards fully analysing the situation with all the data available.

The stewards have dissected it and we have an answer, and that is the end of it.

We have to believe there was little doubt that Perez was responsible otherwise they wouldn't have given him the penalty.",Lewis Hamilton is faster than Nico Rosberg,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75412000/jpg/_75412029_hi022587591.jpg,2014-06-09 21:17:06,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/27771899

Lewis Hamilton says he has no doubt he will be able to catch Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in the world championship.

It was the second time Hamilton had failed to finish in seven races this season while Rosberg has yet to retire.

""There is a long way to go. I caught up before and I'll catch up again,"" said Hamilton, 29.

He then took four consecutive victories to move into a three-point lead, before Rosberg reclaimed the advantage by beating his team-mate in controversial circumstances in Monaco, the race before Canada.

Hamilton retired in Montreal with rear brake failure, caused by a heat-induced failure of the kinetic energy recovery part of the car's hybrid system, which Rosberg suffered at the same time.

Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said it was ""lucky"" that Rosberg's brakes had not failed as well.

""We're just sorry to have let Lewis down and it is a shame, particularly when the championship is as close as it is,"" Wolff said.

Sebastian Vettel was told to ""raise his game"" by his Red Bull team after a troubled start to the season.

Helmut Marko, Red Bull's motorsport adviser, told the four-time champion after April's Chinese Grand Prix to adapt his driving and stop complaining about the car and new rules.

Media playback is not supported on this device Vettel explains 'tough luck' response

""I told him: 'There are 50 engineers working on this engine and they can't sort it out,' said Marko.

""'You're a top driver, it's up to you. You have to do it.'""

The 71-year-old Austrian, a former racing driver, added: ""If he can't sort out the car, the easiest thing is the driver. He has to raise his game.""

In a wide-ranging interview before the return of the Austrian Grand Prix next weekend on Red Bull's own circuit, Marko also revealed that Red Bull had considered signing Lewis Hamilton for the 2013 season.

They decided against it because they felt the 2008 champion would clash with Vettel because they both have big egos.

""We were considering it, but we thought it wouldn't work,"" said Marko. ""To be successful, you need a certain amount of harmony.""

Sebastian Vettel results in 2014 Race Finish Australia Retired Malaysia 3rd Bahrain 6th China 5th Spain 4th Monaco Retired Canada 3rd

Marko added that he preferred to promote someone from Red Bull's own junior programme rather than ""take someone from outside"".

Instead, Mark Webber was signed for further year, before leaving F1 for endurance racing and making way for Daniel Ricciardo, who has out-shone Vettel so far this season.

Marko said Vettel's early-season problems had been exacerbated by the fact that he had suffered more reliability issues than his new team-mate.

Marko said Vettel was also unhappy with the new turbo hybrid engine rules and the effect that these, along with changes to the aerodynamic rules, were having on the team's ability to make the car behave in exactly the way he wanted.

""Sebastian was complaining about having such a bad car,"" said Marko. ""Sebastian wants everything absolutely right.

""His main problem was the downshift was always destabilising the rear and he couldn't understand that we couldn't solve it.

""Furthermore, he thinks the way F1 is going is not the right one - the cars should be monsters, not relatively easy to drive.

""With all these problems, maybe he wasn't as committed as he should have been, but that has changed. Already in Spain we saw already a different approach from this guy.""

In Canada last weekend,Vettel out-qualified Ricciardo for the first time since the second race of the year in Malaysia, although the Australian went on to win the race after passing his team-mate, who finished third, during a pit-stop period.

Marko said that Vettel, along with the rest of the team, had not expected Ricciardo to be so strong this year, especially after the team's troubled pre-season testing programme.

Marko said Vettel was ""a little bit surprised, like we all were, with Ricciardo"" following his switch from Toro Rosso.

In a wide-ranging interview ahead of the return of the Austrian Grand Prix at Red Bull's own circuit this weekend, Marko said Mateschitz had a ""passion"" for the sport.

He added: ""If our whole team was not full of passion, we wouldn't have success.""

Marko said the Austrian Grand Prix's return was the culmination of years of planning by Red Bull and Mateschitz.

The race takes place on the Red Bull Ring, which, as the A1-Ring, hosted the Austrian Grand Prix from 1997 to 2002.

While the track layout remains the same as the last race in 2003, a brand new pit complex, garages and grandstands have been built.

A much faster and more demanding version of the track, called the Osterreichring, also hosted the race on the same site from 1970 to 1987, before being deemed too dangerous.

Marko said the renovation of the circuit, which is not far from Mateschitz's birthplace of Sankt Marein im Murtzal, was part of a wider financial commitment to the region, which includes supporting local businesses.

Mateschitz bought the track, Marko said, because it ""would have died more or less"" and added he always had the idea of bringing back F1 to the region.

To finalise F1's return to Austria, Mateschitz had to fight planning restrictions that stipulated no more than 25,000 people could attend an event at the redeveloped track.

""We had to talk to politicians and they got more common-sense minded,"" Marko said. ""Step by step, we got there.""

Marko said Red Bull considered reviving the demanding layout of the former Osterreichring, which featured a series of high-speed corners with little in the way of run-off areas, but decided it would be impossible to make it safe enough for modern F1 standards.

Rebuilding the track and financing a grand prix, which usually cost tens of millions of pounds a year in sanctioning fees, was ""a huge investment"", he said.

ECB chief executive David Collier said: ""Last year's survey attracted a fantastic response and our county cricket boards and leagues have already responded with innovative and forward-thinking ideas which will all help attract more people to the sport and make it as inclusive as possible.""

360,"Thompson was among several leading contenders to be seen practising alongside the men last Sunday

Network TV cameras homed in on Lexi Thompson striding down the fairway on one of the biggest days of the golfing year.

The 19-year-old American star wasn't even playing. She was watching Martin Kaymer's march to glory in the men's US Open last Sunday.

Ordinarily, she would have been hundreds or even thousands of miles away in another part of the United States.

But she would have been doing exactly what she was doing last Sunday, preparing for the most important event on the women's schedule.

This time, though, she was able to do it on the same course while it was being used by the men, and golf fans were able to see it.

The US Women's Open will be staged on the Pinehurst Number 2 layout when it starts on Thursday. It is the first time the United States Golf Association (USGA) has run the tournaments back-to-back at the same venue.

US Open Championships 2014 Men's Open Women's Open Par: 70 Par: 70 Length: 7,562 yards Length: 6,649 yards Players: 156 Players: 156 Prize fund: $9m (£5,300,977) Prize fund: $4m (£2,357,670) Winner's share: $162,000,0 (£954,000) Winner's share: $585,000 (£345,000) Course rating: 76.0 Course rating: 78.1 Slope rating: 147 Slope rating: 145

Thompson was among several leading contenders to be seen practising alongside the men last Sunday. Then the women took the chance to walk and watch the championship's climax - and the TV cameras were there to film them.

It is a refreshing move that can benefit the women's game hugely. By sharing the same stage as the men, it has already received more media attention than usual.

""Obviously Wimbledon's coming up next week and we're getting what the women's tennis players get in a sense,"" British qualifier Holly Clyburn told BBC Sport.

""It's the first time they've done it and if it comes off it could prove the way forward. It's good for us because we get a sneaky peek and an extra idea of how to hit different shots and what the course is going to be playing like.

Scotland's Catriona Mathew hopes to add to her 2009 Women's British Open title at Pinehurst this week

""I think it's a step forward for women's golf because it gets a bit more recognised and hopefully the crowds will stay around as well.""

The course will be shortened from the monstrous proportions faced by the men. It will measure about 6,500 yards and plenty of water is expected to be applied after the dry conditions of last week.

It will still be an immense test but it should showcase women's golf brilliantly. The sport has been missing a trick by not finding ways for female stars to share the same spotlight as their male counterparts.

There is no logistical reason, for example, for men's and women's matchplay tournaments not to be played at the same time and on the same course.

Provided television contracts were in place, it would allow for more matches to be shown during the weekends when fewer games are being played. There would be more variety for viewers and a better TV product.

Perhaps this move will act as a prompt for such thinking.

US Women's Open: Previous venues and winners 2013: Sebonack Golf Club, Inbee Park 2012: Blackwolf Run, Na Yeon Choi 2011: Broadmoor Golf Club, So Yeon Ryu 2010: Oakmont Country Club, Paula Creamer

In the meantime, let us see how the women cope with the challenge of a course that left only three men under par last week.

While the USGA deserves credit for this enlightened move, it should be criticised for an entry criteria that does not allow for the leading golfer on the Ladies' European Tour to compete.

It is ludicrous that Charley Hull, ranked 34 in the world and already a Solheim Cup hero, is not in the field. She is one of the most exciting talents in the game, yet only the top 25 from the rankings are guaranteed a spot.

Britain's best hope for success is Scotland's Catriona Matthew. In the men's event, Kaymer spoke of his prowess with his iron play being key to his success.

Matthew, the Women's British Open champion of 2009, is particularly strong in that aspect of the game and has the experience and patience for the Pinehurst test.

Date: 17-21 June Race times: 14:30 to 17:35 BST. Feature race 15:45 Coverage: Big-race commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live, results/reports on BBC Sport website

The Fugue, ridden by William Buick, denied star French filly Treve victory in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot.

John Gosden's mare bided her time while Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Treve was well back as Elkaayed set the pace.

But The Fugue quickened up nicely and Treve, under Frankie Dettori, could not respond leaving Buick victorious ahead of Magician (6-1) with Treve third.

It was a fourth Group One win for the 11-2 shot, owned by Lord Lloyd-Webber.

The first three finishers all broke the previous course record for the one mile and two furlong trip.

Gosden's mare had won both the Yorkshire Oaks and the Irish Champion Stakes last season before finishing second in both the Breeders' Cup Turf and Hong Kong Vase, before a trip to Meydan for the Dubai Duty Free in March proved disappointing.

We trained her in the winter and she was like a little bud that went tight, but now she's flowered and she looks great The Fugue's trainer John Gosden

But she showed great determination to bounce back, much to the delight of Buick and trainer John Gosden.

""She's been an absolute star for me and everybody back at the yard,"" said Buick. She proved today what she can do against top-class horses.

""When she gets an uncomplicated run like she did today and they come back to her, she's lethal, like she was there. It means everything to everyone involved.""

Dettori admitted afterwards that he had concerns about Treve from an early stage.

""Going to the start she didn't feel like Treve and at the back of my mind I knew then I was in trouble,"" he said.

""I was hoping in the race she would loosen up and warm up, but I knew my fate at the three-furlong marker. She ran a good third, but it's not the Treve we all know.

""Something is definitely wrong and what's wrong was before the race.""

Earlier, jockey Pat Smullen landed a double when 9-2 joint favourite Mustajeeb won the Jersey Stakes before Anthem Alexander held on to take the Queen Mary Stakes.

In the Jersey Stakes, the winner and fellow joint favourite Muwaary were up at the front early but it was Mustajeeb who settled the better and was able to stay ahead of his rival, also owned by Sheikh Hamdam Al Maktoum.

Date: 17-21 June Race times: 14:30 to 17:35 BST. Feature races 16:25 Coverage: Big-race commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live, results/reports on BBC Sport website

Kingman showed his blistering pace to deny Night of Thunder and win the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.

Night of Thunder was well placed on the rail under Richard Hughes but Kingman was brought wide by James Doyle.

The 8-11 favourite, who was beaten by Night of Thunder in the 2,000 Guineas before winning the Irish equivalent, went past to triumph by a length.

It denied Hughes a third Group One win on the opening day of the Royal meeting.

Earlier he had won the Queen Anne Stakes on the 4-5 favourite Toronado while Sole Power (5-1) won the King's Stand Stakes.

Kingman was settled towards the back of the field by Doyle and trailed turning into the home straight, but quickly made up the ground.

Despite hanging towards the rail in the last half-furlong, it made no difference to the result as he won by two-and-a-quarter lengths ahead of Night of Thunder (3-1) with Outstrip (33-1) in third.

Doyle turned round to his beaten rivals and raised his finger to his lips as he passed the winning line.

""I probably shouldn't have done that,"" he admitted. ""I let my emotions go a bit but I got a lot of satisfaction from that.

Frankie Dettori won at Royal Ascot for the first time in two years, on The Wow Signal

""A lot of things were said after the Guineas and he's proved he's the best of the three-year-olds. We've put that behind us - it was annoying, he didn't get beaten very far and everyone kind of thought he wasn't a champion.

""He's got so much pace, he's almost climbing over the back of them wanting them to go quicker. I'm just very lucky to be sat on his back, I can't thank [owner] Prince Khalid Abdullah enough for giving me this opportunity.""

Toronado, trained by Richard Hannon Jr, was making his first appearance of the season, but showed few signs of rustiness and once Hughes switched him wide in the final couple of furlongs, he cruised to victory.

It was a first win at the Royal meeting for Hannon, who took over from his father last year.

""I was nervous this morning, I feel a bit better now. It's great to get a win,"" he said.

""It's lovely to get the meeting off to a start like that. He did it very well and is settling much better this year. Hughesie rode him with all the confidence in the world.""

Sole Power secured back-to-back victories in the King's Stand Stakes.

After the seven-year-old won on the line under Johnny Murtagh 12 months ago, Hughes took the ride this time and the seven-year-old's acceleration proved key once again to beat outsider Stepper Point with the favourite Hot Streak back in third.

Frankie Dettori secured his 48th career Royal Ascot victory, but first for two years, as The Wow Signal (5-1) won the Coventry Stakes for trainer John Quinn.

England coach Stuart Lancaster has not yet decided who will replace injured fly-half Owen Farrell in Saturday's final Test against New Zealand.

Danny Cipriani impressed as England's second string beat the Crusaders 38-7, before being replaced by Stephen Myler.

Freddie Burns started the first Test at 10 and was on the bench for the second.

Matt Kvesic was excellent - it was definitely the best game I've seen him play this season Stuart Lancaster England head coach

""I don't make quick decisions, particularly on a game as important as Saturday,"" Lancaster, who will announce his team on Thursday, told BBC Sport.

""We'll wait and see. I'm going to think about it overnight.""

Lancaster said half-backs Cipriani and Lee Dickson had ""started well"" and that he was pleased Cipriani and Myler had both got playing time on Tuesday.

Burns sat out the match, as did scrum-half Ben Youngs, with incumbent number nine Danny Care rated 50-50 ""at best"" to be fit for the Test in Hamilton.

New Zealand will take a winning 2-0 lead into the game after a three-try blitz saw them beat the tourists 28-27 on Saturday.

Tuesday's match gave Lancaster the chance to see some of his lesser-known players in action in an England shirt.

""I've learned we've got a good depth of player in this England squad,"" he said after his side ran in six tries in Christchurch.

""I thought [open-side flanker] Matt Kvesic was excellent up front - it was definitely the best game I've seen him play this season.

""He was outstanding at the breakdown and he was all over the field, so I'm really delighted with his performance.

England wing Anthony Watson is going to be a ""fantastic international player"", says Lancaster

""In the backs I thought the half-backs, Danny Cipriani and Lee Dickson, started well and [inside centre] Brad Barritt was excellent as ever, while obviously [winger] Ben Foden took his try well.

""But it's hard to single players out because, while we didn't have it all our own way, to score six tries and win 38-7 against a really good Crusaders side - I'd have taken that at the start of the day.""

England's fifth try came from 20-year-old Bath wing Anthony Watson, who is still eligible for the England Under-20 side that face South Africa in the final of the IRB Junior World Championship in Auckland on Friday.

Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie was joined by the Duchess of Cambridge as he launched Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup.

The historic race first took place off the Isle of Wight in England in 1851 but a British team has never won it.

Oracle Team USA also brought racing close to the shore in 2013 and ushered in a new era of TV production - with on-screen graphics showing those unfamiliar with racing exactly what was going on America's Cup (external website)

""There is a huge passion for the America's Cup in this country and we want to bring it home,"" said Ainslie.

The duchess, who is a keen sailor and watched some of the London 2012 Olympic racing, attended the launch at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, south east London.

Four-time Olympic champion Ainslie, who was instrumental in sealing one of sport's greatest comebacks when Team USA overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in San Francisco, said the victory had been ""way more powerful than anything I had done as an individual"".

""But standing there on the podium lifting the America's Cup, it did cross my mind that it would be much more fulfilling with a British team, and so that is the goal.""

Ainslie is hoping Red Bull Formula 1 design chief Adrian Newey will help the British project.

The 55-year-old is the most successful F1 car designer in history and has masterminded Red Bull's four consecutive drivers' and constructors' world title successes from 2010 to 2013.

""He's keen to help us but he has a lot of other commitments with Formula 1,"" Ainslie told BBC Radio 5 live.

""We've just got to see how his timing works out in the coming months and years but he would be a huge asset.""

He spoke to Newey at November's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and the aerodynamic specialist is now in a position to help after Red Bull announced on Sunday he had signed a new multi-year deal, which will see a shift in his role to wider projects.

Ainslie, who says his team has a budget of about £80m, added: ""There has been a lot of talk about Adrian joining the team and I have met with Adrian a number of times.

""He's a fantastic guy, clearly the most successful Formula 1 designer in history and very passionate about sailing, about the America's Cup.""

Newey has recently negotiated a new deal with Red Bull which may allow him to help Ainslie

Ainslie hopes to base his team in Portsmouth but is prepared to take the venture overseas if his proposals are not given planning permission.

Fred Perry was the last British man to win Wimbledon, completing a hat-trick of wins in 1936

Harold Mahony was the only other Scotsman to win the Wimbledon singles title - in 1896

Murray is the most successful British man in terms of Grand Slam match wins with 113, ahead of Fred Perry on 106

Fred Perry won eight Grand Slam titles - three Wimbledons, one French Open, three US Opens and one Australian Open

Murray has reached seven Grand Slam finals, behind Fred Perry on 10

The final game was a battle in itself, with Murray seeing three match points slip by from 40-0 and fending off three Djokovic break points with some fearless hitting, before the Serb netted a backhand to end the contest.

After a gruelling three hours 10 minutes in searing temperatures, Murray had finally followed in the footsteps of Fred Perry's 1936 win at the All England Club.

Perry used to leap over the net in celebration, but Britain's new champion roared in delight before sinking to his knees on the turf.

Murray, who collected a first prize of £1.6m, then headed into the stands to celebrate with his family and support team, moments later parading the trophy around Centre Court.

He could barely believe he had won, saying: ""It feels slightly different to last year. Last year was one of the toughest moments of my career, so to manage to win the tournament today...

""It was an unbelievably tough match, so many long games.""

And he later gathered his thoughts in a BBC TV interview, telling Sue Barker: ""It was tough speaking after the match. There are a lot of people who have worked with me over the last 10 or 15 years or so.

Tim Henman on Murray's win ""I was privileged enough to go into the locker room straight after the match and Andy was basically in a state of shock. I just gave him a big hug when I got in there and said 'I really don't know how you did that' and he said 'nor do I'."" Read Tim Henman's take on Murray's win here

""I didn't know what to do with myself. The noise levels during the whole match were just incredible.""

The Dunblane native becomes Scotland's first Wimbledon singles champion since Harold Mahony in 1896, and Britain's first since Virginia Wade in 1977.

Murray had been on top from the outset against an unusually erratic Djokovic, finally converting his seventh break point after three dramatic games that took 20 minutes.

The home supporters were brought down to earth immediately when Djokovic recovered the break to love, but the Serb was leaking errors and his 13th in just seven games saw Murray move clear again at 4-3.

A tense game followed after Murray, serving into the sun, opened with two double faults, but he fought his way out of three break points and served out the set to love.

An hour gone, and all was going to plan for the British number one, but Djokovic began to find his range in the early stages of the second set.

The top seed got the better of two rallies approaching 30 strokes as he broke on his way to a 4-1 lead, and looked on course to level at 15-30 in the following game, but Murray would not give it up.

Having struggled to defend his own second serve, Murray now turned the tables and put the pressure on Djokovic, and the Serb succumbed with a double fault to give up his advantage in game seven.

Murray was the man in command once again and when he cracked a 128mph ace and a nerveless smash to save two break points for 4-4, the crowd sensed a real opportunity developing.

Djokovic was vulnerable and he showed it with a tirade at the umpire over a line call when serving at 5-5, but he had run out of Hawk-Eye challenges and moments later netted a forehand to give Murray a priceless opportunity.

Once again, Murray found his best serving form when he needed it most, closing out the set to love with an ace to bring the Centre Court crowd to its feet.

The sense of hope around the stadium became something closer to disbelief when Murray raced in to pick up a drop shot and hammer a forehand on his way to a break at the start of the third, and he threatened to run away with it with seven out of eight games.

Back Djokovic came, throwing in drop shots to get the Briton on the run and reeling off four straight games on his way to a 4-2 lead, but Murray was not to be denied.

He wrestled back the initiative to level at 4-4 and surged on, hammering away at the Djokovic forehand and drawing yet another error to move 5-4 clear.

All that was left was to serve for the title, and it was never likely to be straightforward, but after 12 tortuous minutes Murray sent over a forehand that Djokovic could only put in the net.

""I have played in a lot of Slam finals, all against Roger or Novak,"" said Murray. ""Roger is probably the greatest player ever, Novak is one of the mentally strongest ever. I never had experience on my side.

Venue: Queen's Club, London Date: 9-15 June Coverage: Live on BBC TV, HD, Red Button, online, mobile, the BBC Sport app and Connected TV. TV coverage: Monday-Friday 13:00-18:00 on BBC Two, Saturday 13:15-16:00 BBC One & 16:00-17:30 BBC Two, Sunday 14:00-17:30 on BBC Two (all times BST)

If tennis had one shot to sell itself to the world, the Stanislas Wawrinka backhand would be a good bet.

As beautiful as it is destructive, former Wimbledon champion John McEnroe described the Swiss player's signature stroke as ""the best one-handed backhand in the game"".

""Thank you, John,"" says a bashful Wawrinka when it's put to him.

""That's my style, it's quite natural for me, but more important than looking beautiful is where you put the ball.""

I always want to do everything perfect and play my best game every match, but it's not possible Stanislas Wawrinka

The 29-year-old put the ball in all the right places when he won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, rising to three in the world rankings on the back of that win.

He became the first man outside the 'Big Four' of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray to win one of the four major titles since 2009, and only the second since 2005.

Wawrinka had roughed up the establishment, and yet he appears to be the one bruised from the encounter.

He arrives at Queen's Club this week looking to ""put the puzzle back together"" after a desperate first-round loss at the French Open.

Wild side

If Roger Federer has always appeared born to the role of sporting superstar, his compatriot and good friend sits less comfortably in the role.

The idea of embracing the big time and joining many of his contemporaries by moving to Monaco or Dubai does not appeal.

""I just enjoy living in Switzerland,"" he says. ""I think it's a quiet place, a more or less safe place, a good life. I don't want to live in a big city.""

Stanislas Wawrinka Age: 29

Coach: Magnus Norman

World ranking: 3

Singles career titles: 7

Grand Slam titles: 1

Career win/loss: 319-204

Wawrinka grew up on his parents' organic farm near Lausanne, where they still help troubled children and the mentally and physically disabled.

""It was a really quiet place,"" he explains. ""There were lots of animals and a lot of things to do - there were maybe 25 people working on the farm with the handicapped people.

""But it was perfect for me as a kid. I had the chance to work with my father; I really enjoyed my time. It's part of my life and part of my personality for sure.""

While he might be softly spoken and enjoy the quiet life, Wawrinka is no wallflower. He enjoys the nickname 'Stanimal', a joke that hints at a wilder side.

Any player with such flamboyant strokes must surely have a creative, reckless streak, and in the last three years he has developed a love of skydiving and tattoos.

On his forearm he carries Irish poet Samuel Beckett's words: ''Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.''

Asked which was more terrifying - the skydiving, the tattoos or his first Grand Slam final - he thinks for a moment.

""Maybe the first tattoo. Because when you do your first one, you're doing it for life, so you have to be sure that it's the right one in the right place.""

Pressure point

Wawrinka was eight years old when he took up tennis at his local club under the tutelage of Dimitri Zavialoff, who was only a teenager himself, and that partnership lasted until 2010 when the pair went their separate ways.

In his mid-20s and having been as high as nine a couple of years earlier, Wawrinka feared he had gone as far as he could.

""I had some moments where I was thinking maybe that's my best tennis, that's my best game, and that's it.

Stanislas Wawrinka won the Junior French Open in 2003

""I always put too much pressure on myself. I always want to do everything perfect and play my best game every match, but it's not possible. Sometimes you need to accept and do your best without playing your best game.""

In the space of two years years he split with the man who had guided him since childhood, got married to Swiss TV presenter and model, Ilham Vuilloud, had a daughter, Alexia, and then announced the couple were separating.

Since reconciled, they are learning to manage the conflicting demands of family life and a globe-trotting profession. They will not be following the example of the Federers and taking the family on the road.

""Outside tennis my life is a little bit different with my daughter,"" he says.

""Travelling with the family is not always easy and my daughter doesn't like it. She's four years old and going to school.

""I have to find a good schedule because it's not easy for me travelling without my wife and daughter.""

Wawrinka puts much of the credit for his leap from being a dark horse to a major winner down to coach Magnus Norman, the Swede who took on the role 14 months ago.

From taking Djokovic to five dramatic sets in Australia last year, and ending Andy Murray's reign at the US Open in September, to following up the Melbourne triumph with a first Masters 1000 title in Monte Carlo in April, Wawrinka's progression under the Swede has been clear.

""When I'm on the practice court I'm always trying to improve, to find solutions, to become a better player,"" he says.

""Working with Magnus has helped a lot with that. Mentally speaking I have more confidence, I know what it takes. I'm really happy to work with him.""

But, as Wawrinka says, it is now time to ""put the puzzle back together, find solutions, because the pressure is different"".

Stanislas Wawrinka won his first and only Grand Slam with victory in Australia in January

The backhand

Wawrinka's last appearance on court, on a dank and gloomy Parisian evening, was a disaster.

The French Open third seed was more in danger of clipping the line judges than the lines as his radar malfunctioned spectacularly against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, and the last two sets raced past him 6-2 6-0.

He racked up a crippling 62 unforced errors in a performance so poor it was hard to believe this was the same player whose shot-making had left Murray, Djokovic and Nadal helpless in the previous two Grand Slams.

If Wawrinka is to put the pieces of his game back together in time to challenge for a second major title at Wimbledon, he will need to start with that backhand, the bedrock of his game.

And yet one of the few shots guaranteed to draw a ripple of gasps among those seeing it in full flow for the first time might never have seen the light of day.

""I changed my backhand from two-hander to one-hander at 11 years old with my first coach, Dimitri.

""He asked me to try as for him it was more natural to play one-handed, but it was difficult for me at 11 to play one-handed because you don't have that much power.""

Like a child setting out on a bike without stabilisers for the first time, the absence of that second, guiding hand led to a few wobbles along the way.

""It's not easy, but Dmitri was always behind me, saying: 'It's going to take time but it's going to be better in the end,'"" says Wawrinka.

""And he was right.""",Queen's 2014: Stan Wawrinka eyes improvement after Paris loss,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75294000/jpg/_75294367_hi021954822.jpg,2014-06-10 07:08:57,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/tennis/27698506

Aljaz Bedene - the Slovenian-born player who wants to play Davis Cup tennis for Great Britain - says he has felt British ""for a few years"".

The 24-year-old set up a base in the United Kingdom in March 2008 and will qualify to play for GB in February if his passport application is successful.

""I really love living here. I love British people. I feel like I'm at home,"" Bedene told BBC Sport after his comeback from a wrist injury ended with a first round defeat in the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club.

I want to play for Great Britain in a live rubber if I get a chance and I think there's nothing wrong with that Aljaz Bedene

""I feel like (I have been) living here for longer than six years, and now I just want to bring back to Great Britain. I feel British already for a few years,"" he added.

Bedene's chances of securing a passport in time for Britain's first round tie next March are said to be 50-50. His other major task is to convince existing members of the Davis Cup team that he has a right to be considered. Those conversations have not yet begun.

""Not with the ones at the top. Not Andy yet. But I've spoken to my friends - like David Rice, Ed Corrie - they seem keen, although I don't know what they're thinking when they are not with me.

""But I think in the end they will accept me. I see myself as a British player, and I hope they recognise that as well.""

1.83 m (6ft 0in) Turned pro in 2008 Did you know? Aljaz has a twin brother Andraz, who is also ranked on the ATP tour.

When the BBC first revealed Bedene's intentions last month, the current British number two Dan Evans tweeted: ""So a guy is becoming British who has already played for his country. Doesn't quite sound right to me!""

""There were a few negative comments about that, but I just played dead rubbers,"" Bedene says of the three previous ties he played for Slovenia. ""I never actually played a live rubber so I wasn't really fighting for a country in the way I wanted to. So I want to play for Great Britain in a live rubber if I get a chance and I think there's nothing wrong with that.""

Bedene also argues that competition for places is a good thing. He says he's not in it for the money, and doesn't think his change of nationality would be unfair on existing British players trying to make a living from the sport.

""This always is an issue. If you get a player who at the moment is ranked higher than they are, it brings a certain tension but I think a good motivation for them as well - as it does for me. So I think it should work for both sides.""

The Lawn Tennis Association has expressed concern over the state of the court used to stage Great Britain's Davis Cup tie with Italy in April.

In a letter to the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the LTA claimed the temporary clay court in Naples posed a risk of serious injury.

Great Britain, who included Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, lost the tie 3-2 to miss out on a semi-final place.

The ITF has insisted it takes player safety ""extremely seriously"".

During the tie, players took divots out of the surface and at one point an attempt to remove covers spilt water on to the court.

Media playback is not supported on this device Andy Murray loses to Fabio Fognini at Davis Cup

The LTA's letter to the federation, signed by chief executive Michael Downey, quoted British number one Andy Murray and Davis Cup captain Leon Smith.

In the letter, the LTA stressed its primary concern was safety and felt the court would not have been passed fit for a tournament on the ATP tour.

That view was expressed by Murray midway through the tie.

""It is dangerous,"" he told BBC Sport. ""That back corner is not good enough. If this was on the Tour they would not be using this court.""

An area of the court was flooded when the covers were removed after heavy rain on the first morning of the tie.

Ground staff failed to sweep the standing water away before removing the covers and that section never recovered.

The LTA was also unhappy that no floodlights were installed for the tie, meaning Murray had to complete his Friday match on Saturday morning - just hours before he was due to play the doubles rubber.

An ITF spokesman said: ""It was the view of the tie referee that these requirements were met by the Italian Tennis Federation and that despite the condition of the court after the rainfall, the court was not unsafe.

""Floodlights are not a compulsory requirement and indeed many ATP and WTA events do not have floodlights.

Andy Murray's 19-match winning streak on grass came to an end with defeat by Radek Stepanek at Queen's Club.

Murray, the defending champion, missed eight set points in the first set before going down 7-6 (12-10) 6-2 to the 35-year-old Czech.

Match analysis ""Had Murray lost early in the French Open and lost today, there could be concerns. But he got to the semi-finals in Paris and he won a match on Wednesday. His first serve went off a bit and he let Stepanek dictate too much. I think it was just an all-round very good grass-court performance from Stepanek. Murray might well take a few days off - which could be good for him. He looked a bit fatigued in that set. But let's be clear, this will have no relevance on his performance at Wimbledon.""

It was the Briton's first defeat on grass since the 2012 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer.

Murray's next competitive appearance will be when he opens play at Wimbledon as the defending champion on 23 June.

The 27-year-old's hopes of gaining extra match time on the grass, and ideally winning a fourth Aegon Championships title, floundered on a sweltering afternoon in London.

He will now hope to put in some valuable work with Amelie Mauresmo, who was named as his new coach on Sunday.

""I thought the first set was a pretty high standard,"" said Murray. ""I thought he served pretty well throughout the whole match.

""I have only got myself to blame that I lost the first set. I don't know how many set points I had, but quite a lot of them were on my serve.

""On this surface especially, you shouldn't really be losing sets like that. For me, that's what's disappointing about the match.

""Then unfortunately I got broken in the first game of the second set. I couldn't quite get it back. The tie-break was tough.""

Media playback is not supported on this device Queen's: Andy Murray loses epic first set tie-break

Stepanek always had the credentials to test Murray as a former semi-finalist at Queen's and quarter-finalist at Wimbledon, and a fixture in the world's top 50.

It was against Stepanek at Wimbledon in 2005 that the 18-year-old Scot first made his breakthrough in terms of national attention, when he beat the then 14th seed in the second round.

The Czech had won only one of their five meetings since then but chose a high-profile occasion to take his revenge.

Murray had his chances, breaking serve in the first game only to hand it straight back, and letting a 6-2 lead slip in the tie-break, with a double fault and two unforced errors contributing.

Stepanek saw off four more set points before grabbing his opportunity, thumping away a forehand volley on his second set point.

Match stats Stepanek Murray 11 Aces 6 4 Double faults 5 62% 1st serve % 63% 90% 1st serve win % 63% 32% 2nd serve win % 44% 3/7 Break points 1/2

Murray could make little impact on an increasingly confident opponent, winning just four of 42 points on the Czech's first serve.

With his own second serve vulnerable, he remained under pressure.

Any hope of a fightback from the champion disappeared in game seven as a Stepanek return on break point clipped the net and dribbled over, leaving Murray stranded and facing a double-break.

There was no more luck required as Stepanek saw out the final service game, and Murray had once again come up short when defending the title he won in 2009, 2011 and 2013.

Top seed Stanislas Wawrinka beat Sam Querrey 6-2 6-2 to set up a quarter-final against Marinko Matosevic, who beat fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2 6-4.

Second seed Tomas Berdych joined his compatriot Stepanek in the last eight with a 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 victory over Adrian Mannarino.

Top seed Rafael Nadal suffered a shock straight-sets defeat to Dustin Brown in his first match on grass this year at the Gerry Weber Open in Germany.

The Spaniard, who won his ninth French Open title on Sunday, lost his serve three times as he lost 6-4 6-1 in under an hour in the Halle second round.

World number 85 Brown will play Philipp Kohlschreiber in the quarter-finals.

Roger Federer began his preparations for Wimbledon with a three-set victory over Portugal's Joao Sousa.

The Swiss defending champion and second seed won 6-7 (8-10) 6-4 6-2 to reach the last eight.

""I didn't play,"" Nadal said. ""That can happen when you play an opponent like this. But I don't want to talk about the opponent.

""For the first four games he didn't put any returns on the court and then suddenly he was playing winners from the return, so it's difficult to analyze these kinds of matches.

""The only thing I can do is keep working the way that I did the last three days, because I came here, I tried hard, I tried my best.""

Brown, from Germany, said: ""I never played against a world number one before, never played him before, so this is just crazy for me.""

Federer, a six-time champion in Halle, was playing his first match since he lost to Ernests Gulbis in the French Open fourth round.

""The first day when I came here to practise it was bit so-so and everyday after that was very good,"" said Federer, who will play Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun in the next round.

""It was important to stay calm (after losing the first set) and actually it gives me more confidence winning this way than maybe just 6-4 6-4, and you don't quite know what is going on.""

It looks like I'll be heading to Wimbledon a little earlier than planned after losing to Radek Stepanek at Queen's.

I'd never say it's a blessing in disguise - I don't enjoy losing and I messed up that first set by missing so many set points - but at least I now get the chance to give my body a bit of a break.

I have done a fantasy World Cup team and I'd say my best player is Sergio Aguero Andy Murray

I've played a lot of tennis over the past few weeks after reaching the French Open semi-finals and I'll have a rest on Friday and Saturday, before getting back on the practice court at Wimbledon on Sunday.

It will also give me the chance to watch a few World Cup matches - I'll give you my tip at the end of the column.

I had planned to take Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday off if I'd got to the final at Queen's, but that can just move forward and give me five or six days on the grass next week.

My new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, is going to play in an exhibition while I'm resting and we'll get back together after the Rally For Bally charity match at Queen's on Sunday afternoon, when we can head over to the All England Club to start work.

We haven't worked out the specific details of how many weeks she might travel with me in the future, but part of the reason I want to have a coach with me for a decent amount of time is that it makes communication easier.

Murray is looking forward to spending some more time with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo

It can be quite hard when someone is leading the team but they're not around that much, because they don't know how physical matches have been, or all the stuff you've been doing on the court or in the gym.

Obviously, Amelie and I don't know exactly how it's going to work out yet because we've only spent two days together, and I've been playing matches on those days, so there's not a whole lot you can do in that time.

Murray's recent Queen's Record 2014 Third Round 2013 Winner 2012 Second Round 2011 Winner 2010 Third Round

My match against Paul Henri-Mathieu on Wednesday finished quite late and I went out and hit a few more balls afterwards, then saw the physio. I had a little chat with Amelie after that but there was no chance to go out for dinner or spend the evening together as I had a match to prepare for the following day.

Next week we'll have a lot of time to talk on the practice court in a bit of peace and quiet, before things start to get a bit hectic in the few days before Wimbledon starts.

Amelie is a former Wimbledon champion, so she's experienced all of that, and she also knows that however many times you go through it, making the switch from clay to grass is tricky.

For the last four or five weeks, when I've been serving on clay, the ball has come back slowly and I've been hitting the ball up high. On grass, it comes back faster and lower, and I struggled with that against Stepanek.

Amelie Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006, battling back after losing the first set to Justine Henin

The body also takes time to adjust to the different movements. I've been sliding on the clay for weeks and that's different to the way you have to stop on these courts.

You have to stay a lot lower on grass and that works your hips, backside and lower back as you bend down a lot more. On the clay you use your quads as you're getting the ball up higher.

The good news is my body feels good, it's just little technical things that I have to work on, and two days isn't always enough when you come up against a good opponent.

So while I'm staying off the court and out of the gym for the next couple of days, I can turn my attention to the World Cup.

Most of the games are fairly late so I'll probably watch them at home, maybe with a few friends. We've got a sweepstake going but I haven't picked my teams out yet, and I'm hoping there are still a couple of contenders left.

Can Sergio Aguero shine at the World Cup, like he did for Champions Manchester City this year?

I have done a fantasy World Cup team and I'd say my best player is Sergio Aguero. In the Premier League you have to think about 38 games; in the World Cup you need guys who aren't going to get knocked out in the group stage.

I think Argentina will do well, with the climate and everything, and it could be Messi's time to shine.

The husband of Elena Baltacha has praised his wife's ""incredible strength"" during her treatment for liver cancer.

The former British tennis number one died in May at the age of 30.

And Nino Severino said his wife had never complained about her disease, and showed her fighting spirit right until the end.

""In all the time I spent with Bally, this is what really showed what a person she was,"" said Severino.

Wimbledon champion Andy Murray is among a number of tennis stars playing in a charity fundraiser in memory of Baltacha on Sunday.

Baltacha had announced her retirement from playing in November having struggled with injury and illness during her career.

She married her coach Severino shortly before her diagnosis in January.

Severino was Baltacha's coach before the pair got married

""Bally was ill for quite a long time,"" explained Severino.

""The medical people couldn't seem to understand why. The symptoms she was showing didn't seem to indicate anything with the liver. She had loads of tests that all came back clear.

""But she had this really, really bad cough and then it was in January she got a pain in her side and that's when we found out.

""When she got the diagnosis, she was obviously very shocked, very upset. I was beside myself. It was very, very difficult.

""Lots of humans go through horrible, horrible things but this woman was 30 years old, she had just retired and she had so many amazing things at her feet and then we were up against this fight.""

Born in Ukraine and raised in Scotland, Baltacha won 11 singles titles, made the third round of Wimbledon in 2002 and was part of Great Britain's Fed Cup team for 12 years, under the captaincy of Judy Murray.

And Severino described how bravely his wife had battled against her illness.

""She never once, through the whole ordeal, ever complained,"" he said.

""She said 'please' and 'thank you' to everybody, treated everyone with respect. She always put my feelings first before hers, never wanted me to be upset.

""I literally spent every second with Bal fighting all the way. It was horrendous cancer that she had, the worst you can get, in the liver. The fight was brutal.

""There were a lot of nerves on the court today, especially in the first four games. The ultimate goal was to get to the final here and win it. That still stays in front of me.""

Wawrinka had gone through his first three matches without dropping serve, but the Australian Open champion could not contain Dimitrov.

The Swiss double-faulted to fall behind in game five, and the set was effectively over when Dimitrov cracked a brilliant backhand winner to get the double break.

A stunning drop shot on the slide had the crowd roaring early in the second set as the flamboyant Bulgarian continued to make the running, serving his way out of trouble when required.

Wawrinka succumbed to the pressure at 3-3 when two loose forehands saw him drop serve for a third time, and after the Swiss smashed his racquet in frustration, Dimitrov coolly saw out the win, converting match point with an ace.

A former world junior number one, the Queen's Club tournament supported Dimitrov in his younger years with wildcards, making his achievement this week all the more enjoyable.

""I always wanted to be in a final out here,"" he said. ""Stepping out on that Sunday means a lot to me.

""I don't know why I have such a strong intuition about this tournament. It has always been one of the biggest events for me, for some reason. There's nothing better than to be in the final.""

Asked about the state of his grass-court game ahead of Wimbledon, Wawrinka said: ""I can still improve, for sure. I need to do more hours on the practice court.

""In general, I feel OK. I'm sure I'm going to be ready for Wimbledon, and I'm sure if I can start the tournament well I will have a chance to do really well.""

Lopez, 32, won the opening set of a hard-fought contest against Stepanek by edging the tie-break, before getting the only break of serve in the match to set up a final against Dimitrov.

""He's one of the youngest guys and one of the best players on the tour right now,"" Lopez said of the Bulgarian.

""It's going to be very tough. He beat Stan very easy today, so he's going to be very confident, as I am.""

Roger Federer has won his seventh Gerry Weber Open in Halle, beating Alejandro Falla 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-3).

Switzerland's Federer, the number two seed, was winning his 14th title on grass and 79th overall with his victory against Colombian Falla in Germany.

It is the second title of 2014 for the 32-year-old who will attempt to secure an eighth crown at Wimbledon which starts on Monday, 23 June.

Four of Federer's Wimbledon wins have come after claiming the Halle title.

Defending the only title he won in 2013, Federer triumphed in one hour 28 minutes.

Although he missed the chance to close out the first set on serve at 5-3, he claimed five straight points from 2-2 in the tie-break.

The second set also went to a tie-break where Federer took control after forcing a mini-break on the first point.

Falla, 30, ranked 69, was seeking his first tour title.

Federer - who earlier this month failed to reach the French Open quarter-finals for the first time since 2004 - had won their previous six meetings, though Falla had served for the match when they met in the Wimbledon first round in 2010, before the Swiss eventually prevailed in five sets.

""We grew up together, we trained together as teenagers, we went on tours together,"" said Keothavong. ""One of the special moments we both shared together was representing Britain in the Olympics.

""We got to play doubles together there and it was incredibly special to us to be part of that in London. It's one of many things I'll never forget.""

The campaign has so far raised £56,000. The proceeds will be split between the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis.

Bulgaria's Dimitrov, 23, seeded fourth, beat Lopez 6-7 (8-10) 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (8-6) at the Aegon Championships.

It is his fourth career title, and he is the first man this year to win titles on three different surfaces.

""This tournament in particular has been the tournament I always wanted to win,"" said Dimitrov.

""I remember playing as a teenager here, and ever since I have dreamt about that moment.

""You can feel it in the spirit of the trophy itself. When you lift it, it means something. The only thing I can say is I'm going to be with a lot of positive vibes going to Wimbledon.""

Lopez, 32, went desperately close to landing the fourth title of his career and the 10th seed was a dejected figure afterwards.

Match analysis ""The serving from both players was exceptional. Feliciano choked on that forehand at match point and he will be devastated by that, but Dimitrov has now won titles on hard, clay and grass courts this year and it shows what a complete player he is.""

He had his chance at match point in the second set tie-break, facing a second serve, but snatched at the return and hammered it into the net.

The Spaniard had earlier saved two break points before edging the opening set in the tie-break, converting his fourth set point when Dimitrov slipped and netted a forehand.

A similarly tight second set turned in a gripping 12th game that saw Dimitrov recover from 15-30, and then match point down, thanks to a raking backhand pass and a stunning volley along the way.

Now in top gear, Dimitrov dropped just one point in the tie-break and moved 40-0 up in the opening game of the decider as he swept through 13 of 14 points - only to undo all his hard work.

Allowed a way back into the game, Lopez did brilliantly to earn break point and thumped away a volley; having lost just two service games all week, he looked well set to close out the match.

A classic grass-court duel came down to a third tie-break and the chances remained fleeting, with the first rally coming at 4-4, but this time it was Dimitrov in the ascendancy.

The Bulgarian matched his opponent by missing a match point when he framed a forehand high into the stands, but the former world junior number one clinched victory when Lopez could only find the net with a forehand.

""When I'm on the court, I'm a different person,"" she says. ""I'm just here for business.

""You have to find the way to perform in any job to your best. That's the way I do it. You have to recreate that and train that way to stay at the top level.

""As a kid I played 10 hours a day, imagining myself playing on the big stadiums. I think that's the passion I have for the game.""

In recent months some of that passion was diverted into other pastimes, such as painting and walking her dog Duke, as she went through a lengthy rehab process until she was able to return to the practice court last month.

""I think the best way is to try to get the best out of that time, and I definitely feel like I did that,"" says Azarenka.

""I got the best out of those months on the court, in the gym, the whole experience.

""I didn't watch much tennis because I don't watch much anyway, unless I'm at the tournament. It was tough at times because I didn't know when I was going to be able to play again, but after I started training it was a lot better.""

Azarenka lost her Australian Open title in January and has slipped to eighth in the world following her injury break, but she has remained patient over her comeback.

She might have the career plan of a stock-market trader, but she was not about to gamble on her fitness just to make Wimbledon.

""Desperate is definitely not the right word,"" she says.

""I'm looking forward to it because I love the tournament. I love the fans there, the tradition - it's one of the best tournaments in the world.

""I happened to get a wildcard for Eastbourne and I really wanted to test myself and see how I can go, because I think competition is the best way to see where you're at, so you can adapt little bit and see where you want to improve.""

Azarenka meets questions about the next few weeks with the obligatory ""no expectations"" response, but does she ever go on court expecting anything other than victory?

""Well, you've got to believe that,"" she says with a big grin.

Radwanska, 25, suffered her third consecutive first-round loss in Eastbourne, but in the last two years has gone on to reach the final and semi-finals at Wimbledon.

Wozniacki is a former world number one but currently ranked 16th. She arrived in Eastbourne on the back of a first-round loss at the French Open, after which she headed to Miami for a break.

397,"Andy Murray cannot meet Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer until the semi-finals

Wimbledon 2014

Venue: All England Club, London Date: 23 June to 6 July Coverage: Live on BBC TV, HD, Red Button, Radio 5 live, 5 live sports extra, online, mobile, the BBC Sport app and Connected TV.

Defending champion Andy Murray has been seeded third at Wimbledon - a rise of two places from his world ranking of fifth.

Murray, who ended Britain's 77-year wait for a male singles champion last year, has benefited from Wimbledon's unique seedings formula.

It means the Scot cannot meet Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer before the semi-finals.

Djokovic overtakes world number one Nadal as top seed, with Federer fourth.

Analysis ""Being one of the top four seeds could be a significant advantage to Murray. There's now no chance he will have to play Federer, Nadal and Djokovic in back-to-back matches from the quarter-final stage: the equivalent of a Northern Hemisphere team having to beat Australia, South Africa and New Zealand on consecutive weekends to win the rugby union World Cup.""

Wimbledon, which starts on 23 June, is the only one of the four Grand Slam tournaments not to stick to the world rankings when seeding the men's event, instead using a formula based on grass court form over the past two years.

Murray, 27, reached the Wimbledon final in 2012 and then won the titles at both Queen's Club and the All England Club in 2013.

If Murray reaches the quarter-finals, he can expect to play either Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych, David Ferrer or Milos Raonic.

Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka drops from third in the rankings to a seeding of fifth, having lost in the first round at Wimbledon for the last two years.

Speaking at Queen's Club last week, the Australian Open champion said: ""Wimbledon, they do what they want. For me it's fine.

""I knew that with my past two years on grass I didn't have any results, so for sure my ranking will drop a little bit for the seedings.

How the men's seedings work Revised seeding arrangements for men were introduced in 2001 when the seedings committee disbanded. The following formula is now used: Take ATP Entry System Position (ESP) points at 16 June 2014.

Add 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in past 12 months.

Add 75% points earned for best grass court tournament in 12 months before that.

""At the end of the day, it doesn't change much. You have to play well. You have to start the tournament well if you want to go far, and that's simple.""

Wawrinka's preparations for Wimbledon have been hampered by illness after he developed a 'high fever' following practice on Monday.

Doctors gave him some medication and advised him to rest. The Swiss number one will not practise before Thursday at the earliest.

Spain's Feliciano Lopez, who was beaten by Grigor Dimitrov in the Queen's final on Sunday, is the biggest beneficiary of Wimbledon's unique seedings formula, moving from 25th on the ATP list to 19th seed at Wimbledon. Dimitrov is seeded 11th.

The women's event adheres to the world rankings, leaving Serena Williams as the top seed ahead of Li Na, Simona Halep, Agnieszka Radwanska and French Open champion Maria Sharapova.

Serbia's Ana Ivanovic, who won her first grass-court title on Sunday with victory in the Aegon Classic final at Edgbaston, is seeded 11th.

Britain's Heather Watson and Jo Konta have both made the main draw directly, without the need to go through qualifying.

Colombia made an impressive start to their Group C campaign as an early Pablo Armero strike set them on the way to a comfortable win over Greece.

The Napoli defender rolled in Juan Cuadrado's fifth-minute cut-back.

Teofilo Gutierrez, leading Colombia's attack in the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao, then touched in from a James Rodriguez corner after the break.

Theofanis Gekas headed Greece's best chance against the bar, before Rodriguez steered in a late third.

Colombia's 3-0 win was their best result in World Cups, in their 14th match

It was a very solid showing from Colombia, who are looking to progress beyond the last 16 of a World Cup for the first time after finishing runners-up to Argentina in South American qualifying.

But the pressure is on attacking talents such as Gutierrez and Rodriguez to produce goals after Monaco forward Falcao, their nine-goal top scorer in the qualification campaign, was ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury.

He did his bit to help his compatriots by offering hugs and moral support to his team-mates in the tunnel before the match.

And cheered on by the majority of the crowd at Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte, Jose Pekerman's side responded with a goal inside the first five minutes.

Greece: Not-so-lightning Greece have conceded in the opening seven minutes of their first match in each of their three World Cup finals appearances. They went a goal down after two minutes of a 4-0 defeat against Argentina in Boston at the 1994 tournament, and in the seventh minute as they lost 2-0 to South Korea in Port Elizabeth at South Africa 2010.

The creative Cuadrado rolled the ball across the penalty area from the right, and Armero - who spent the second half of last season on loan at West Ham - scored only his second goal in 54 international appearances with a shot that trundled in off Greece centre-back Kostas Manolas.

It was a far from spectacular goal - and television replays showed three Colombia players were standing in offside positions - but the left-back and his team-mates celebrated with an eye-catching dance in front of their bench.

The craft of £37.6m Monaco midfielder Rodriguez and pace of Cagliari forward Victor Ibarbo threatened repeatedly to cause further damage to the Greece backline, although they had to be patient before the rewards came.

And Pekerman's defence had to survive some difficult moments themselves, with Panagiotis Kone unable to take either of two chances that came his way.

Kone should have equalised within seconds of Armero's opener, but scuffed wide from 15 yards after former Celtic striker Georgios Samaras had cut the ball back to him from the left.

The Bologna midfielder went close again just before half-time when his 20-yard steered shot was pushed away athletically by keeper David Ospina after Gekas's charge into the penalty area was held up and Samaras worked the ball loose.

James Rodriguez's late goal sealed a sixth Greece defeat in seven World Cup finals matches

But it was a frustrating afternoon for Greece, who lacked enough adventure to find a way back into the match.

After the impressive Rodriguez had ended a run with a shot from outside the area that keeper Orestis Karnezis beat away, he then delivered the corner that led to Colombia's second goal, with Abel Aguilar flicking on at the near post for an unattended Gutierrez to touch in from inside the six-yard box.

Gekas, preferred to Fulham striker Kostas Mitroglou in attack, capped a day to forget when he headed Vasilis Torosidis's nod-back against the bar from six yards.

Colombia sealed victory with a stylish late goal, as exciting Fiorentina midfielder Cuadrado burst to the edge of the penalty area before setting up Rodriguez to guide a shot into the corner of the net.

Colombia coach Jose Pekerman:

""The crucial thing was that everyone did the job they were tasked with and that allowed us to play calmly. This result is very important for us and sets us up well for the rest of the group stage.

""We haven't won anything yet, though I am very happy with this performance.

""We can prove how great Colombian football really is, but this was only the first game.""

Greece coach Fernando Santos:

""They caused us a lot of problems from the opening minutes. We did get back into the game, though, and the end result was a little bit unfair.

""The score doesn't show it, but I think we played well.

Story of the match

Cavani penalty puts Uruguay ahead

Navas pulls off acrobatic save from Forlan

Two goals in three minutes puts Ticos in front

Pereira red-carded for late challenge

Costa Rica produced a breathtaking second-half revival at Estadio Castelao to beat Uruguay for the first time in their history in their Group D opener.

The victory was inspired by Arsenal striker Joel Campbell, who scored one and made another in the first match in England's group.

It was a far cry from a first half in which Edinson Cavani put a comfortable Uruguay ahead from the penalty spot.

Key facts Costa Rica scored more than twice in a World Cup game for the first time.

Uruguay have now gone six opening games without a win, last winning their first match at a World Cup in 1970.

Costa Rica scored with three of their four shots on target, all of which came in the second half.

Costa Rica scored twice in three minutes through Campbell and defender Oscar Duarte to spark scenes of jubilation in Fortaleza.

But they were not finished there as substitute Marcos Urena raced onto Campbell's through ball and clipped his shot beyond Fernando Muslera.

To make matters worse, Uruguay had Maximiliano Pereira sent off in injury time for a spiteful challenge on Campbell. He will now be suspended for Thursday's game against England.

This was Costa Rica's first World Cup victory since 2002, and only their fourth in the tournament's history, against a Uruguay side missing the injured Luis Suarez.

The result means Costa Rica are top of Group D after Italy beat England 2-1, while Uruguay face an uphill battle to qualify for the last 16.

Uruguay looked in control for the opening 50 minutes. Cavani wasted a good early chance after Costa Rica failed to clear a Diego Forlan free-kick, with the Paris St-Germain striker slicing high and wide with the goal at his mercy.

He soon made up for that miss.

Edinson Cavani has scored 22 goals in 63 games for Uruguay

Costa Rica defender Yeltsin Tejeda conceded a needless free-kick wide on the Uruguay left and when Forlan curled the set-piece into the area, Junior Diaz tried to stop Diego Lugano by wrapping his arms around his waist.

The referee pointed to the penalty spot and Cavani did the rest, steering a piercing low shot beyond Keylor Navas's dive and into the bottom corner.

The goal settled nerves. Uruguay's passing improved, as did their movement. Forlan, the player of the tournament in 2010, might have made it 2-0 before half-time when his shot struck Duarte's leg, deflecting it high into the air and requiring Navas to pull off an acrobatic save.

Costa Rica, though, were about to turn the game on its head with Campbell - who is yet to make his Arsenal debut despite signing for the club in 2011 - to the fore.

The striker, who spent last season on loan at Olympiakos, first arrowed a shot narrowly wide from 30 yards, while Giancarlo Gonzales might have scored twice, missing a difficult headed chance and seeing a scrambled toe-poke deflected into the side-netting.

But in the space of three minutes, the game changed beyond recognition.

First, Cristian Gamboa chased a seemingly lost cause wide on the right flank, reaching the ball on the byeline. He delivered a cross which flicked off the head of Celso Borges and fell to Campbell, who controlled and fired beyond Muslera.

Two minutes later, they swept forward again and Walter Gargano conceded a free-kick for a crude tackle on Bryan Ruiz. Christian Bolanos's delivery was pin-point, Duarte's low header was brave, the finish sublime.

And there was more drama to come.

With time running out, Costa Rica broke forward again and Urena raced away from Godin and captain Lugano, making perfect contact with his right boot, lifting the ball over Muslera to seal victory for Los Ticos.",World Cup: Uruguay 1-3 Costa Rica,http://www.bbc.com,[],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/75533000/jpg/_75533025_campbell_duarte_epa.jpg,,en,http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/25285064

Ivory Coast scored two goals in as many minutes to come from behind and get their World Cup campaign off to a winning start with victory over Japan.

The Elephants trailed to a stunning Keisuke Honda strike in the first half.

But the introduction of Didier Drogba as a substitute inspired the comeback, with Wilfried Bony equalising after meeting Serge Aurier's cross.

Aurier also provided the cross for former Arsenal forward Gervinho to head home the winner.

""What a comeback by Ivory Coast. Head coach Sabri Lamouchi's decision to keep Wilfried Bony on when he introduced substitute Didier Drogba looks inspired.""

The victory at Recife's Arena Pernambuco moved Ivory Coast level on three points at the top of Group C with Colombia, who beat Greece 3-0.

Ivory Coast, appearing in their third World Cup, have never gone past the group stage but will fancy their chances after a spirited performance.

However, it all looked to be going wrong for manager Sabri Lamouchi, who surprisingly left out former Chelsea striker Drogba and saw his side fall behind.

Asian champions Japan - the first team to qualify for the World Cup - were sharp and nimble in possession and took the lead with a goal of real quality from Honda on 16 minutes.

The AC Milan midfielder collected a pass across the box, took one touch and then drove home powerfully into the top corner with his left foot.

Ivory Coast had their moments, with midfielder Yaya Toure showing occasional glimpses of his destructive power, while Bony was guilty of wasting several chances.

But shortly after Drogba's introduction, the Swansea strike equalised, leaping to glance a fizzing Aurier cross into the far corner.

Two minutes later, another drilled Aurier centre was met by Gervinho and his header squirmed past Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima.

Drogba twice went close to finding the net in the closing stages as Lamouchi's side finished strongly to leave Japan with an uphill battle to stay in the tournament.

Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi:

""The players are very happy with the victory but we are far from being qualified.

""We did not start very well in the game, conceding the first goal from a careless mistake, then we created many good chances.

""Having a player like Didier Drogba in the team, or among the substitutes, changes a game.""

Japan boss Alberto Zaccheroni:

""We have to give credit to the Ivory Coast - they had a great game.

""We did not put them under enough pressure. We were not aggressive enough. We could not play as we normally do, especially in the second half after conceding the two goals.

Substitute Haris Seferovic scored in the third minute of stoppage time to earn Switzerland a dramatic win over Ecuador in their opening Group E match.

Seferovic turned in Ricardo Rodriguez's low cross as Ottmar Hitzfeld's side came back from behind to claim victory.

Fellow substitute Admir Mehmedi headed Switzerland level after Enner Valencia had given Ecuador a half-time lead.

Valencia's header from a Walter Ayovi free-kick was his fifth goal in successive games for his country.

Hitzfeld's two substitutions were key to turning around a match that looked to be slipping away from his side after a poor first-half display.

The coach, a Champions League winner with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, is retiring at the end of the World Cup - and has set himself the target of guiding Switzerland to their first quarter-final since 1954.

Enner Valencia has now scored in five successive appearances for Ecuador

They arrived in Brazil as Group E seeds and ranked sixth in the world, but struggled in the face of an energetic first-half Ecuador performance.

Reinaldo Rueda's side are keen to make an impact in Brazil to provide a fitting tribute to forward Christian Benitez, who died of heart failure last summer.

They restricted Switzerland to threatening with long-range shots and set-pieces during the opening 45 minutes, with keeper Alexander Dominguez keeping out efforts from Xherdan Shaqiri, Rodriguez and Gokhan Inler.

And Ecuador went in front midway through the first half, helped by some poor Swiss defending at a free-kick.

Hamburg's former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou - preferred at centre-back to Basel's Fabian Schar - was culpable as striker Valencia was left unmarked six yards out to head in Ayovi's delivery from the left midway through the first half.

But Ecuador's lead was wiped out early in the second half from a near-identical set-piece as their defence switched off.

Swiss bliss Switzerland's victory was the first they have recorded over a South American team at a World Cup finals in six attempts

Rodriguez whipped a corner towards the near post and Mehmedi, Freiburg's leading scorer in the Bundesliga last season, got above Carlos Gruezo to head in - 121 seconds after coming on at half-time.

Ecuador's exciting but inconsistent winger Jefferson Montero threatened to restore their lead by sprinting past Stephan Lichtsteiner to power in a shot that keeper Diego Benaglio beat out at the near post.

Switzerland then enjoyed a good spell of pressure as their opponents appeared to tire, and Josip Drmic turned the ball into the net from a Rodriguez through-pass, but was ruled offside.

Then Bayern Munich forward Shaqiri fired wastefully into the side-netting from a tight angle with two men in support after being played in by Mehmedi.

Switzerland had to survive several scares in the closing stages, though, with Valencia almost grabbing a second after a mix-up between Djourou and Benaglio, before the keeper pushed away Michael Arroyo's deflected free-kick.

Hitzfeld's side pulled through and clinched victory on the break as Valon Behrami made a brilliant defensive block before Rodriguez charged down the left and crossed low for Real Sociedad striker Seferovic to convert at the near post.

Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld: ""It was a dream end to the game for us and is very important for the morale of the team.

""It will give us some extra strength for the next two matches.""

Ecuador coach Reinaldo Rueda: ""We lost our organisation, which has been one of our characteristics, at the end of the match, we were somewhat betrayed by our emotion.

""This provoked the goal which took the draw away from us. I believe a moment of naivety costs us the match.""

Karim Benzema scored twice as France became the first team to benefit from goalline technology at a World Cup in their victory over 10-man Honduras.

The moment occurred in the 48th minute for France's second goal, when it ruled keeper Noel Valladares nudged Benzema's shot over the line.

The Real Madrid forward gave France the lead from the spot after Paul Pogba had been fouled by Wilson Palacios.

Match analysis ""It's been so easy for France - a piece of cake for them, really. Before the sending off and penalty they were dominating. ""Confidence is high and they will take some stopping in this group.""

Benzema added a late third with a vicious strike from a tight angle.

The match will be remembered for that historic moment when the GoalControl tool was called into action.

Brazilian referee Sandro Meira Ricci awarded the goal straight away as Benzema's sidefoot effort came off the far post, rolled across the line, bounced off Valladares and appeared to fully cross the line before the keeper could claw the ball back into play.

At first the system ruled 'No Goal', causing confusion inside the Porto Alegre stadium when that message was displayed on the big screen.

But that was for the initial hit off the post. A second judgement then came on whether the ball crossed the line after coming off the Honduras keeper.

Despite the technology showing the ball had clearly crossed the line, Honduras players and coaching staff remonstrated with the officials. They were already down to 10 men following Palacios's red card for pushing over Pogba, and this was another bitter blow.

But they had little to complain about regarding the end result. France were brilliant, and should be rightly considered as strong contenders for the title.

Match facts France have won their first World Cup match since the 2006 semi-final (v Portugal)

Benzema is the first France player to score two goals in a single World Cup game since Zinedine Zidane scored a brace in the 1998 final

They had already gone close before the penalty through Blaise Matuidi, when his shot was pushed over by Valladares, and through the exceptional Antoine Griezmann, whose header struck the bar.

That was despatched from the spot with confidence by Benzema, who battled hard for his team up front against a physical Honduras defence. For France's second, the post denied Benzema what would have been a hat-trick with goalkeeper Valladares being awarded the goal for his deflection.

There was no doubt about his third. Diminutive Mathieu Valbuena delivered an excellent free-kick from the right which found Griezmann. The 23-year-old Real Sociedad forward's low drive was blocked, but there was Benzema to blast the rebound into the roof of the net.

France can now seal their passage into the knockout round with victory over neighbours Switzerland, who earlier defeated Ecuador, in what promises to be an exciting clash at the 2014 Fifa World Cup on Friday.

Lionel Messi scored a superb goal as Argentina began their World Cup campaign with a win over World Cup debutants Bosnia-Hercegovina.

Argentina went ahead when Messi's free-kick was put into his own net by defender Sead Kolasinac.

Messi then played a one-two with Gonzalo Higuain, jinked past two defenders and rifled in to make it 2-0.

Analysis ""We were sat there in the stadium and there was a real sense of disappointment throughout the crowd. Everyone wanted to see Lionel Messi light the place up, but I think he was playing with us and he came out in the second half and showed what he can do. ""He scored that goal and came to life, he was floating about and getting into some good positions. Messi was the defining factor.""

The goal lifted Argentina and, despite Vedad Ibisevic slotting in late on for Bosnia-Hercegovina, they held on.

All eyes were on Messi in the first game of the tournament at the famous Maracana stadium in Rio and, even though the four-time World Player of the Year took time to get going, he announced his arrival in sparkling style with his goal.

The strike was his second World Cup goal in nine games and provided the one piece of mesmerising magic Messi managed in a game in which he and Argentina improved the longer it progressed.

The blue and white of Argentina fans was prominent at the spiritual home of fierce rivals and hosts Brazil, although they had to watch on as a disciplined Bosnia stifled their side for most of the first half.

There was huge hype around Messi and Argentina getting their campaign under way, and the forward helped his side take an early lead with his first meaningful touch.

He supplied the left wing free-kick which was flicked on by team-mate Marcos Rojo before the ball came off defender Kolasinac and went into his own net.

However, Argentina rarely looked like adding to the goal as they lacked pace and invention, while regularly giving the ball away.

Bosnia slowly settled into the match and created sporadic chances, starting with a Miralem Pjanic shot being punched away by keeper Sergio Romero.

Pjanic also opened up Argentina when he clipped a ball over the top of their defence, which Izet Hajrovic brought down only for Romero to quickly come out and save.

Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano had a powerful low shot blocked away by Bosnia keeper Asmir Begovic before Bosnia again went close to equalising.

Senad Lulic managed to steal in and get on the end of a corner but his low header was palmed away by Romero.

Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella brought on Higuain and Fernando Gago after the break and the move from 3-5-2 to 4-3-3 worked as La Albiceleste had more urgency about them after the reshuffle.

The improvement culminated in Messi's eye-catching goal. He played a one-two with Higuain before his balance, poise and pace helped him to evade two Bosnia defenders on the way to arrowing in an 18-yard shot off the inside of the post.

Bosnia gave Argentina some late concern when Lulic slipped a pass through for Vedad Ibisevic to angle in a low shot with six minutes left, but Sabella's side avoided any more scares.

Story of the match:

Muller scores a hat-trick

Portugal's Pepe sent off in the first half

Hummels heads in Germany's second before being injured

Portugal suffer their heaviest defeat at the World Cup

Thomas Muller scored the first hat-trick of the 2014 World Cup as Germany produced a ruthless attacking display to destroy 10-man Portugal and open their World Cup campaign in style.

The 24-year-old, who scored five goals to win the Golden Boot in South Africa four years ago, took his World Cup total to eight with a sensational performance.

The Bayern Munich forward dispatched an early penalty, drilled home Germany's third and tapped in a fourth, with centre-back Mats Hummels heading the second before going off with a knee injury.

'It's all gone wrong for Portugal' ""Germany have played so patient. Sometimes in our country we rush it because of the crowd and the excitement but the Germans have played to their tempo. They look really solid at the back as well. ""Portugal's situation is similar to Spain. But if they win their two games, they will get through. ""They've got two winnable games and they've just got to make sure they win them.""

Portugal lost defender Pepe to a needless red card at 2-0 after he appeared to headbutt Muller, and Paulo Bento's men could not recover as Cristiano Ronaldo had little chance to impress.

The result was wrapped up with plenty of time to spare, putting Germany in pole position to dominate Group G and fuelling hopes of a first World Cup triumph since 1990.

Although Joachim Low's men had won each of the past three meetings between these sides, including at the same stage of Euro 2012, Portugal made the better start, with Ronaldo to the fore.

The Real Madrid forward was troubled by knee and thigh problems in the build-up, but showed no sign of discomfort. His early break set up Hugo Almeida for a weak shot, before the two-time Ballon d'Or winner beat Per Mertesacker and drew an alert save from Manuel Neuer.

Since 2002, Portugal have had six red cards in 15 World Cup games - twice as many as any other side

That scare seemed to spark Germany into life. Sami Khedira missed an open goal after a poor clearance by goalkeeper Rui Patricio, but the opener would soon arrive.

Muller, Mesut Ozil and Mario Gotze were causing Portugal all manner of problems and, when the latter was hauled down after forcing his way past Joao Pereira, referee Milorad Mazic pointed to the spot. The penalty was tucked into the bottom corner by Muller.

That settled Germany into a rhythm, executing their 4-2-1-2-1 formation far better than Portugal to look solid at the back and capable of threatening every time they came forward.

Nani drilled a rare Portugal effort narrowly over the bar, but Gotze almost doubled the lead with a shot that deflected wide. Then, following Toni Kroos's resultant corner, Hummels did burnish the advantage, exploiting Portugal's sloppy zonal marking to head powerfully past Patricio.

Portugal briefly rallied. Fabio Coentrao inexplicably tried to cross for Ronaldo when he should have shot and Eder - on the the injured Almeida - headed over.

But any hopes they harboured of a comeback were dashed when Muller fell after what looked like a flailing arm from Pepe, who reacted by bending down and nudging his head against that of the grounded German.

Portugal coach Bento seemed appalled at the Real Madrid defender's actions, and Portugal's afternoon deteriorated further when Bruno Alves struck a clearance straight into the body of Muller, who reacted sharply to lash a shot under Patricio.

The contrast on the two benches as the half-time whistle blew was stark - all smiles and high-fives among the Germans, bowed heads and dejection among the Portuguese - and the interval did little to change things.

The Muller-Ozil-Gotze axis continued to wreak havoc and they combined again as Gotze slipped Ozil though, but the Arsenal playmaker was denied by Patricio and Muller headed the rebound over.

Facts from the match Portugal conceded four goals in a World Cup game for the first time in their history

Muller has now scored six goals in his last four World Cup games

Only Spain (17) have won more penalties at the World Cup than Germany (13)

Ozil's disappointment at being replaced by Chelsea's Andre Schurrle epitomised how much Germany were enjoying the game, and Gotze went close again after a stunning counter-attack involving Muller and Schurrle.

The only downside for Low's side was a knee injury to Hummels but Portugal had plenty to ponder, not least the irate Ronaldo, who was furious not to earn a penalty for Benedikt Hoewedes's challenge on Eder.

Their day would get worse still, though, when Muller completed the rout after Schurrle's drive was repelled. It was the first time Portugal had conceded four goals in a World Cup match.

Ronaldo almost had the final word with a blistering free-kick, but Neuer proved his equal.

Germany forward Thomas Muller:

""I've been involved in the last three major tournaments so I'm used to the pressure.

""But to score three goals in one game - that's pretty amazing, and the goals just got better and better. It's fantastic, but the merit also goes to the rest of the team.

""I just felt a blow from Pepe's fist, but I can't really remember much of what happened after.""

406,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Iran 0-0 Nigeria

Iran and Nigeria played out the first draw of the 2014 World Cup as their Group F opener ended goalless.

Nigeria dominated possession but created few chances against a disciplined side managed by ex-Manchester United coach Carlos Queiroz.

The Super Eagles' best opportunities came in the first half, when Ogenyi Onazi fired a yard wide before Ahmed Musa went close with a free-kick.

Iran's Reza Ghoochannejad forced a great save from Vincent Enyeama.

Match analysis ""The decision making in the final third when Nigeria managed to get there was poor. They made the wrong choices. The quality of the balls into the box was poor and they didn't play to their strengths. ""This is the game they should have wanted to go out and win and you would think there would be more urgency in their play.""

The share of the points leaves both teams well placed in the group after Argentina defeated Bosnia-Hercegovina.

African champions Nigeria were fancied to go through with the South American giants, but the pressure is now on them to beat the section's only European side, who impressed in their first ever World Cup match on Sunday.

Iran, on the other hand, will be buoyed by this result and will be looking to cause one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history on Saturday against Argentina.

They performed diligently, with Queiroz getting the best out of a group of players who stuck rigidly to the tactics employed.

Their conservative approach, with midfielders Javad Nekounam and Andranik Timotian as an extra line of defence for the backline, frustrated Nigeria.

Stephen Keshi's side were limited to only a couple of chances despite having the lion's share of possession. The first fell to Lazio forward Onazi, who slammed his shot a foot wide before Musa almost caught out goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi with his quick thinking from a free-kick.

Ironically, Iran had the best chance to score despite their only effort on goal coming when Charlton's Ghoochannejad, who spent much of his career to date playing in the Dutch and Belgian leagues, forced a excellent reaction save from Enyeama, playing in his third World Cup.

Match facts This was Nigeria's second World Cup goalless draw in their 15th match - the other being against England in 2002

Iran had one effort on target, the joint-fewest by a team in a game in this tournament, along with Honduras and Cameroon

Two teams have failed to score against Nigeria in the Super Eagles' last nine World Cup games: England and Iran

Keshi - the mastermind behind Nigeria's unexpected Cup of Nations win last year - tinkered with his attack after the break by bringing on former Newcastle stalwart Shola Ameobi and fellow forward Peter Odemwingie of Stoke.

The tactical swaps almost paid dividends in the 71st minute, when Ameobi headed wide from eight yards, but he had conceded a foul in the process.

The former Magpie also had a chance in the closing minutes, but on this occasion his goalbound header was easily cleared by Mehrdad Pooladi.

That draw now means Nigeria have not won a World Cup match in nine attempts - the longest streak in the competition. They might need to rethink their strategy against Bosnia-Hercegovina if they do not want that run to continue.

Iran coach Carlos Queiroz:

""We played against a great team and it was necessary to play a realistic game. We fought for every ball, every space and played 90 minutes with one thing in our mind. My players need to be congratulated.

""Now it's Argentina and the most important thing is that everything is open to us.""

Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi:

""Respect to Iran, they had their game plan to sit back and defend and they did well.

""Win or lose I'm criticized. A draw now, I'll be criticized. It's part of the game. In my country, it's win at all costs and sometimes it doesn't go that way.''

Nigeria forward Peter Odemwingie talking to BBC World Service:

""We expected three points from this game but everybody knows the most important game is between ourselves and Bosnia-Hercegovina.

""Next game I think will be easier and I think that will be the decider of where we will be at this World Cup.""

John Brooks headed a late winner for USA in a dramatic finale to their opening Group G game against Ghana.

Clint Dempsey put USA ahead on 29 seconds with the fifth-fastest goal in World Cup history, cutting inside John Boye before sweeping home.

Ghana upped the tempo and equalised when Andre Ayew latched on to Asamoah Gyan's backheel to fire in a leveller.

Analysis ""One of the moments of the World Cup for me was the reaction of John Brooks for the winning goal. That was priceless. That is what the World Cup is all about. ""The way Ghana conceded the corner kick that led to the USA winner was poor. In these games, you can't do that. They are in trouble. They still have to play the big dogs in the group.""

USA looked tired but Brooks nodded in from six yards following a corner to give his side a winning start.

Centre-back Brooks reacted with a mixture of disbelief and delight, the Germany-born 21-year-old marking his Fifa World Cup debut and fifth cap in style.

The victory also gave USA a measure of revenge for being knocked out of the past two World Cups by Ghana.

They had looked to be tiring, and a winner seemed unlikely as Ghana dominated the second half and pulled themselves level.

But their tenacity was rewarded to leave the Black Stars precariously placed, with both teams having to face Germany and Portugal.

Ghana exited the World Cup four years ago in tears, when Gyan's missed penalty in the last minute of extra-time against Uruguay denied them the chance to become the first African side to reach the semi-finals.

If they were still nursing that pain, they did not show it as they sang and danced their way into the dressing room at the Estadio das Dunas.

But they fell behind within the first minute. Dempsey collected a Jermaine Jones pass on the left wing, cut inside right-back Boye and shot into the far corner.

Ghana struggled to mount a response as the USA consolidated their lead with a work-rate and organisation that kept their rivals at bay.

Indeed, Jurgen Klinsmann's side could, and maybe should, have extended their lead. Striker Jozy Altidore controlled a low, right-wing cross but his shot from 10 yards was blocked by Boye.

That was Altidore's last major act of the game, a hamstring injury seeing him replaced by Aron Johannsson.

Key facts Hertha Berlin's John Brooks was left out of a match against Bayer Leverkusen in April after a newly-inked tattoo caused him to miss training.

Clint Dempsey has scored in three successive World Cups, with two of his three goals coming against Ghana.

Ghana had 21 shots, a joint-high in the World Cup so far (along with Ivory Coast) but only three were on target.

USA scored more than once for only the third time in their past 12 World Cup games.

USA centre-back Matt Besler also left the field injured, and his exit, combined with Ghana increasing the pace of their play, resulted in the Black Stars piling the pressure on Tim Howard's goal.

Most of the chances fell to Gyan, but he nodded high from 10 yards when unmarked before having another header tipped wide by Howard.

Gyan may not have scored, but he set up his side's equaliser as his lovely backheel teed up Ayew to shoot home with the outside of his right foot.

It seemed Ghana might have enough time to engineer a winner, but Hertha Berlin defender Brooks had other ideas, and his first international goal following Graham Zusi's corner proved decisive.

Klinsmann has a 100% record in opening World Cup games

United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann:

""I said to the bench a few minutes before our winner, 'We are going to get some chances - we need to push and grind it out.' We trained over and over on set-pieces and it was well deserved.

""We have a great spirit and fight until the last minute. It was a grind but it was a wonderful one at the end of the day.

""There is stuff we need to improve. We had problems with keeping the ball.""

Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah:

""What I can say is that it was a very tough game. Playing at this high level, any little mistake can cost you dearly.

""We didn't deserve the first goal against us and we did create a lot of chances.

""Unfortunately we could not take our chances and the US took theirs.

""Any loss of concentration can cost the team big time. I believe the first goal unsettled us a little bit but I never expected it to end this way.""

Goals from Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens saw Belgium come from behind to beat Algeria in their World Cup Group H opener in Belo Horizonte.

The north African side took a shock lead when Sofiane Feghouli scored from the spot after being fouled by Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen.

Manchester United's Fellaini, a second-half substitute, equalised with a looping header shortly after coming on.

And Mertens scored the winner when he finished off a swift counter-attack.

The 80th-minute strike prompted an eruption of relief from the Belgium bench, not least from coach Marc Wilmots, who had spent most of the match looking understandably pensive.

Match facts Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku failed to register a single touch in the opposition area

Algeria ended a run of 506 minutes without a goal at the World Cup finals

Thibaut Courtois is yet to lose a match he has played for Belgium (W11 D7) and has kept 10 clean sheets in 18 games

His side had 65% possession but for most of the game found it difficult to penetrate an Algeria defence marshalled by former Rangers centre-half Madjid Bougherra.

The European side, the seeded team in the group and widely tipped to do well in Brazil after an impressive qualifying campaign, fielded an imposing starting XI, with the Chelsea pair of Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku in attack, while Spurs' Mousa Dembele and former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne sat in midfield.

Pre-tournament fifth favourites with some bookmakers, they looked anything but for 69 minutes.

They were rocked in the 24th minute when forward Feghouli was hauled down by Vertonghen in the area as he aimed to convert Faouzi Ghoulam's cross.

The Valencia player recovered to sidefoot a tame penalty past another Blues player Thibaut Courtois, who dived the wrong way. That was Algeria's first World Cup goal since 1986 - 506 minutes of football.

Belgium's best early chances were from long distance and fell to Zenit St Petersburg's Axel Witsel, who had two efforts saved before failing to convert a header.

Match analysis ""It was a massive win for Belgium. My only concern is, centre-forward wise, do they have one to fire them to the semi-final? I'm not sure they do.""

The pattern changed with the Belgium substitutions. First to test the goal was 19-year-old Lille striker Divock Origi, who forced a brilliant low save from Rais Mbolhi.

Gaps began to grow in a tiring Algeria defence, and a fresh Fellaini took advantage of that when he outmuscled marker Carl Medjani and flicked his effort beyond the reach of Mbolhi.

The winner came from a move that showed off Belgium's attack at its best.

De Bruyne tackled Feghouli in his own half and when the ball found its way to Hazard on the left, the PFA young player of the year sped down the wing and fed Mertens, who slammed his shot high into the net.

Belgium almost grabbed a third through Fellaini, but Mbolhi produced another good save from point-blank range.

Belgium coach Marc Wilmots:

""It was a tough match but we were patient throughout and at the end we were rewarded.

""We stayed calm after doing a small mistake in the first half. We got a new momentum. We saw that Algeria were getting more and more tired. At half-time people were a bit down, but I said 'don't worry, we will score and we will change totally the match'.""

Algeria coach Vahid Halilhodzic:

""It's a major disappointment. I would have liked to have a couple of tougher and more resilient players to resist their attacks but I don't have much of a choice.

""We missed a great opportunity here. But in the second half it was a bit tough. We left too much space to the Belgian team and the two goals scored against us were to be expected.""

Story of the match:

Brazil denied by Ochoa brilliance

Scolari's men disappoint in second Group A game

Both sides on four points

Brazil unbeaten in 39 successive matches in own country

Brazil produced an unconvincing display as Mexico held them to a goalless draw with an outstanding performance by goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's side were again well short of their best in a cauldron of an atmosphere at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza.

Match analysis ""Brazil played against a good Mexico side. On several occasions Guillermo Ochoa showed lightning quick reactions - as a single individual he was definitely man of the match. ""It's not the end of the world for Brazil, and they created good chances. ""The real disappointment for me was Fred. The comer flag moved better than he did. Jo was much better. ""We shouldn't judge Jo just on what he did in England with Manchester City. But Fred is one of those players who can come back.""

Neymar and captain Thiago Silva had the best of Brazil's chances but were denied by Ochoa.

Mexico more than held their own, testing home keeper Julio Cesar through substitute Raul Jiminez and peppering his goal in a breathless second half.

The result leaves both sides with a chance of topping Group A. Brazil face Cameroon in Brasilia in their final match, knowing a point will be enough to see them through.

This was a game in which the hosts' reliance on the brilliance of Neymar and Oscar was exposed. Fred failed to appease his critics with a toothless display in attack, while Paulinho and Luiz Gustavo lacked imagination in midfield.

It is not the first time Brazil have struggled against Mexico - no team has beaten them more often in the 21st century - and they were fortunate not to lose again.

Ochoa, who has left French club Ajaccio, was in exceptional form

Neymar was in the thick of the action from the off, dancing away from Mexico defenders, and drawing several fouls.

And it was the Barcelona striker who had the best of the early chances. From Dani Alves' cross he rose high at the back post to head powerfully towards goal. Ochoa threw himself to his right to tip the ball to safety.

In Brazil the save was compared to Gordon Banks' famous dive to keep out Pele's header in the 1970 World Cup.

Ochoa made another vital save with half-time approaching, spreading himself to smother a close-range stab by Paulinho, after Silva chested on a free-kick.

But Mexico gave every bit as good as they got.

Match facts Brazil's Fred only completed eight of his 16 passes against Mexico

Only two of Brazil's last 26 World Cup games have ended goalless

Brazil had won their three previous World Cup meetings with Mexico, by a combined score of 11-0

Ochoa made six saves in this game. No keeper has made more in a game in this World Cup so far (Rais M'bolhi of Algeria also made six saves, against Belgium)

Oribe Peralta led wave after wave of Mexico attacks, but it was Hector Herrera and Jose Juan Vazquez who went closest before the interval with piercing shots from distance, one of which Cesar tipped over, while the other whistled just wide.

Though Brazil remained short of their fluent best, the introduction of Bernard for Ramires at half-time added zip to their attack.

Neymar curled a free-kick wide and went closer still as he chested down Bernard's cross and drilled a fierce low shot at goal, only for Ochoa to deny him once more.

Former Manchester City striker Jo, on as a substitute, dragged a shot wide as Brazil became increasingly desperate for a goal.

Andres Guardado fizzed a shot just over Cesar's crossbar, while the Brazil goalkeeper had to react quickly to turn away a thunderous low shot from substitute Jiminez. Mexico finished the game with purpose and belief. Brazil must do better.

410,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Russia 1-1 South Korea

Former England coach Fabio Capello saw his Russia side come from behind to draw with South Korea in Group H thanks to a goal by Aleksandr Kerzhakov.

The substitute drove the ball home to join Vladimir Beschastnykh as Russia's all-time top scorer with 26 goals.

South Korea had led through a long-range shot from Lee Keun-ho that squirmed through the hands of goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.

Belgium top the group after their earlier win over Algeria.

Analysis ""Russia did not react until the 68th minute when they went a goal down. All of sudden they went two up front and were an attacking force. ""Russia's Akinfeev was struggling holding onto everything all night. That goal from South Korea is schoolboy. For someone who has 70 caps for Russia, that may be his last.""

The late excitement in Cuiaba was in stark contrast to much of what had gone before.

South Korea had been marginally the more inventive side, although they needed a significant amount of luck to take the lead as the edgy Akinfeev gifted them the opening goal.

But the substitutions by Capello - who led England to the last 16 in 2010 - proved crucial for Russia, looking to build a platform from which to advance to the knockout stages for the first time since the Soviet Union reached the second phase in 1986.

Son Heung-min had Korea's best two chances of the first half, linking well with Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young on both occasions. But he failed to hit the target with either chance, while captain Koo Ja-cheol saw a deflected shot fly just wide.

Russia had been limited to long-range efforts, Sergey Ignashevich's free-kick forcing Jung Sung-ryong into an unconvincing save.

Neither goalkeeper inspired much confidence and after Jung had tipped a shot from Victor Fayzulin over the bar in the first minute of the second half, captain Vasily Berezoutski headed into the side netting from the resulting corner.

Match facts Including games as the Soviet Union, this was Russia's first draw in 12 World Cup games

This was the first time in four World Cups that South Korea haven't started with a win

Russia's last eight goals in the World Cup have all come after half-time

South Korea have won only two of their last 11 World Cup games

The sides then traded speculative shots and Akinfeev struggled to keep out a free-kick from Kim Young-Gwon.

But that was nothing compared with the error he made on 68 minutes, when he allowed a 25-yard head-height shot from substitute Lee to slip through his hands and into the net.

Russia, however, had been showing more urgency since the introduction of Alan Dzagoev, and a second Capello substitution paid off almost immediately.

Kerzhakov, the 31-year-old Zenit St Petersburg forward and record goalscorer in Russian domestic football, had been on the field for just three minutes when he struck to earn a deserved point on the eve of the Italian's 68th birthday.

Dzagoev's low shot was well saved but South Korea could not clear and when the ball cannoned into Kerzhakov, he showed the necessary composure to fire home a right-footed shot from six yards out.

Russia saw the chance to press for a winner and Alexander Kokorin went close with two headers before Aleksandr Samedov fired well wide in stoppage time.

Russia boss Fabio Capello told BBC Sport:

""It was a good game, they ran a lot in the first half and then felt tired. You saw the goal they scored, it was not easy to react.

""But the players were really good and most important for me was the reaction. We also twice had a chance to score a second goal.

""I know Kerzhakov did well, he's a fantastic player. He always offers us a way to score goals.""

South Korea coach Hong Myung-bosaid:

""In such a tournament, the first match is the most difficult. There is a lot of pressure on it, so I thought the players played very well.

""I think our players really did their utmost on the pitch today. Tactically and physically, each and every moment they played intelligently.

""We focused our rhythm and organisation on this match. I think it worked well. The condition of players and organisation of the team was good.""

411,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Australia 2-3 Netherlands

Netherlands secured a last-16 place in the 2014 Fifa World Cup as Memphis Depay gave them victory over Australia, who are out of the tournament.

Arjen Robben angled in a shot to put the Dutch ahead, but Tim Cahill soon equalised with a stunning volley.

Mile Jedinak slotted in a penalty for Australia before Robin van Persie lashed home to level it at 2-2.

Mathew Leckie then missed a chance for the Socceroos, and Depay sent in a 25-yard shot for the winner.

Analysis ""Australia are the lowest ranked team here but it was a heroic effort, an incredible goal by Tim Cahill and they should have won the game. That minute cost them with Mathew Leckie missing the chance at one end and the goalkeeper's mistake at the other. What a game, what a World Cup.""

Netherlands demolished holders Spain in their opening game and, though they came nowhere near those heights, they had enough to overcome a bold Australia at the imposing Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre.

Progress to the last 16 was secured after holders Spain were beaten by Chile, who join the Dutch on six points in the group.

Having lost to Chile in their first match, Australia's hopes of reaching the next round are over, but their youthful side certainly gave Netherlands a scare.

Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou said before the game his side intended to attack - and they were true to his words in the opening exchanges.

But a flash of quality from Robben saw the Netherlands take the lead against the run of play. The Bayern Munich forward feinted his way past Alex Wilkinson on the halfway line, raced towards the Australia goal and drove in an angled shot for his third goal of the World Cup.

The Socceroos responded immediately with one of the goals of the tournament so far, Cahill meeting an angled ball from the right with a powerful left-foot volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

Had midfielder Mark Bresciano and defender Matthew Spiranovic shown the same poise, Australia could have taken the lead earlier than they did.

Key facts Arjen Robben has scored eight goals in his past eight games for the Netherlands, and four in his past four World Cup games.

Tim Cahill has netted three goals in his past three World Cup games.

Robin van Persie only completed one pass (out of four attempted) in the first half.

Bresciano ran onto a low Leckie cross only to shoot over from just inside the area, while Spiranovic got away from his marker at a free-kick but side-footed an eight-yard shot straight at keeper Jasper Cillessen.

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal had complained about his view from the dugout before the match - and much of what he saw is not likely to have pleased him, especially defensively.

Cahill and Van Persie were both ruled out of their teams' final group games after being shown their second yellow cards of the tournament, either side of Leckie having a goal disallowed after he was adjudged to have fouled Daley Blind.

But Australia continued to press, and went in front when an Oliver Bozanic cross struck the hand of Daryl Janmaat and Jedinak slotted home from the spot.

The lead did not last long, though, as Van Persie netted his 11th goal in 10 internationals, controlling the ball before turning and firing into the roof of the net.

Australia again opened up the Dutch and Tommy Oar crossed for Leckie, who chested rather than headed the ball straight at Cillessen.

But it was Depay who decided the outcome of the game, the 20-year-old PSV Eindhoven winger curling a shot beyond the reach of Mat Ryan to give Netherlands their first victory in four games against Australia.

Australian coach Ange Postecoglou:

""I just wanted the players to get the reward for the way they went about things today.

""I have put a lot of pressure on the players and the staff that we are going to be a certain type of team and take it to world-class opposition, but it is one thing saying it and another thing doing it.

""They did that today but didn't get their reward. It's heartbreaking and massively disappointing.""

Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal:

""If in the first half you lose the ball so simply or so often, then the formation doesn't matter. I needed to change something at half-time to boost their confidence and change their mindset.

""Fortunately it turned out OK, but it could have turned out differently. In the second half we had more chances and the way the players came from behind was incredible. To recover and correct that situation showed a lot of mental strength.""

Story of the match:

World Cup holders are out

Vargas punishes Spain for losing possession

Casillas mistake leads to Chile's second

Costa and Busquets spurn glorious chances

Spain's dominance of global football was brought to a crushing end as they were knocked out of the World Cup by an impressive Chile.

The defending champions were aiming to become the first nation to retain the title since Brazil in 1962. But, after losing their opening match 5-1 to the Netherlands, they surrendered their crown in a cauldron of noise in the Maracana.

First-half goals from Eduardo Vargas and Charles Aranguiz did the damage as Spain failed to contain the rampant Chileans, or muster a response of any real substance.

Their elimination means they are the fifth defending champions to fail to progress from the group stage at the World Cup.

It was Chile's first competitive victory over Spain in 11 matches - and just reward for an attacking masterclass.

Pundits on Spain Thierry Henry: ""I've been in that position with France and it's not fun. Spain gave us so much pleasure, you feel sorry for them and sad."" Rio Ferdinand: ""Chile didn't give them a second's peace. It was almost Premier League-like. It was side-ways, slow football from Spain."" Clarence Seedorf: ""For Spain, there's been some bad choices. They just didn't combine well and you could see them struggle.""

Questions will inevitably be asked about the international futures of Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque and several of his most trusted players, such as goalkeeper Iker Casillas and midfielders Xavi and Xabi Alonso.

There was little sign of shock as the full-time whistle sounded; more despondency and resignation. Chile celebrated, but not wildly; they deserved their victory and will not want to stop there.

Spain must now contest a dead rubber against Australia on 23 June, while Chile and Netherlands meet in an encounter that will determine who finishes top of Group B.

Chile were tipped by many to do well in the competition, but few predicted they would administer the fatal blow to Spain and one of the game's most glittering eras.

Media playback is not supported on this device Watch Iker Casillas's mistake lead to Chile's second goal

Their fans arrived in huge numbers and helped generate an incredible pre-match atmosphere, although a group of them storming the media centre before kick-off provided a sour preamble.

They seemed to enjoy far greater representation inside the ground, and the noise levels rocketed as Jorge Sampaoli's team made an encouraging start - Alonso forced into a vital goalmouth clearance before Gonzalo Jara headed narrowly wide.

Spain were narrow victors when the sides met at the 2010 World Cup, and again in a friendly the following year, but needed a last-minute equaliser to snatch a draw last September.

Chile have been dubbed by some the 'Spain of South America' - a reference to the Spaniards in peak form - and their pace, power and pressing is a sight to behold.

They opened the scoring in style after Alonso carelessly under-hit a pass, allowing Alexis Sanchez to begin a scintillating move that ended with Aranguiz squaring for Vargas to round Casillas and slot home.

Spain responded positively, and predictably enjoyed plenty of possession, but Alonso shot way over the bar and Diego Costa fired wide.

Del Bosque made a massive call by relegating Xavi to the substitutes' bench, moving David Silva into his attacking midfield position and using the younger, quicker Pedro on the right.

Key facts In winning Euro 2008, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012, Spain conceded a total of six goals, one fewer than they have so far at World Cup 2014. Spain have conceded two or more goals in more than one game at a single World Cup tournament for the first time since USA 94. Chile have won four of their past six World Cup games after failing to win any of their preceding 13.

But, if anything, Spain looked worse without a man who, while enduring a poor campaign and struggling in Friday's thrashing by Netherlands, has for so long been La Roja's outfield leader, the symbol of their philosophy and one of the best players in the world.

The dropping of centre-back Gerard Pique was less of a surprise but, similarly, did not benefit Spain and their defence looked no more assured or unified with Javi Martinez partnering Sergio Ramos.

They needed to get to half-time without conceding again, but even that proved beyond the European champions as Casillas palmed a Sanchez free-kick straight out to Aranguiz, whose control and finish with the outside of his foot was of the highest order.

Spain finally rallied after the break, Andres Iniesta sending Costa clean through - but Mauricio Isla arrived from right-back with a perfectly-timed challenge. Sergio Busquets then missed an open goal from five yards following Costa's overhead kick.

Isla should have extended Chile's lead only to sky a shot from close range, while at the other end Iniesta and substitute Santi Cazorla were twice denied by Claudio Bravo as Spain bowed out.

Cameroon failed to progress beyond the World Cup group stage once again as they slumped to defeat against Croatia.

The African side fell behind in the 11th minute as Ivica Olic fired home, and were reduced to 10 men after Alex Song lashed out at Mario Mandzukic.

Match analysis ""I was in Cameroon when the team qualified for the World Cup. ""There was so much joy and hope, that after failing to qualify for two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, they had finally turned the corner. ""It won't be the defeat that hurts the most, it'll be the way the team has played. Too defensive, too cautious, too afraid. The antithesis of what made Cameroon perhaps Africa's most famous football nation.""

Ivan Perisic made it 2-0 when he punished goalkeeper Charles Itandje's poor clearance, before Mandzukic headed home Croatia's third.

Mandzukic added his second, tapping in after Eduardo's shot was parried.

Niko Kovac's side now face Mexico in their final Group A game knowing victory would assure them of a place in the last 16 for the first time in four attempts.

But Cameroon have failed to reach the second round for their fifth successive World Cup.

They looked rudderless without injured captain Samuel Eto'o, and their task became more difficult when Song lost his cool five minutes before the break.

The Barcelona midfielder inexplicably lashed out at Mandzukic's back as he tracked the Croatia striker, and referee Pedro Proenca had no hesitation in showing him a red card.

Cameroon were already a goal down, with Olic having tapped in after a lovely pass from the impressive Perisic.

Media playback is not supported on this device Cameroon players bust-up after Croatia defeat

Wolfsburg midfielder Perisic, who has been linked with Everton, then went close with a header before he doubled Croatia's advantage with a excellent run and finish after Itandje found him with a poor kick.

Mandzukic, who was suspended for Croatia's opening game, then showed his aerial prowess by netting a powerful header following Danijel Pranjic's corner.

And the Bayern Munich striker completed the rout with an easy tap-in after the nervy Itandje could only push substitute Eduardo's tame shot into his path.

Cameroon's best attempt came in the dying seconds, when substitute Pierre Webo's header forced Stipe Pletikosa to save brilliantly.

And there was still time for the four-time African champions' full-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto to thrust his head at team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo during an argument in stoppage time.

Cameroon still have to face hosts Brazil, and will have to improve markedly in both performance and discipline if they are to avoid another embarrassment.

414,"Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Colombia 2-1 Ivory Coast

Colombia clinched a last 16 place at the World Cup after beating Ivory Coast to secure their second win from as many Group C games.

James Rodriguez headed in a near post corner and Juan Quintero slotted home after Serey Die was caught in possession to put Los Cafeteros 2-0 up.

But Gervinho skipped past three Colombia defenders and powered in a shot to give Ivory Coast hope.

The Ivorians exerted some late pressure but Colombia fended them off to win.

Analysis ""It has been an absorbing game, really good to watch. Both teams have gone for the win. The atmosphere was outstanding as well.""

With Japan and Greece drawing 0-0 in the later game, the win means the South Americans have reached the knockout stages for the first time since 1990.

Ivory Coast, meanwhile, are still well-placed to reach the last 16 after their opening game win as they next face Greece.

Both sides could still face England in the next stage - should Roy Hodgson's men manage to get through their group - and produced an enthralling game which sparked to life after the break.

Colombia had the greater attacking intent and Teofilo Gutierrez should have put them ahead. Replays showed the striker was marginally offside but he was not flagged and failed to capitalise when he horribly mistimed a side-footed effort from eight yards.

Still, he was faring better than Ivory Coast's Wilfried Bony. The Swansea City striker failed to touch the ball in the opposition half, most glaringly when he failed to connect with two crosses when well-placed either side of half time.

It was little surprise when he was replaced by Didier Drogba.

Colombia, though, proved more potent. An acute angled Juan Cuadrado strike was tipped on to the face of the crossbar by keeper Boubacar Barry before the South Americans scored.

Key facts Colombia have already equalled their record of goals scored during a World Cup (Five, in 1962).

Ivory Coast's three World Cup games against South American sides have all ended in defeats

Juan Cuadrado (three) has now provided more assists at a single World Cup than any other Colombian since 1966

Rodriguez powerfully headed in a Cuadrado corner for his second goal of the tournament.

Ivory Coast responded when Serge Aurier's cross almost sneaked in at the near post before being punched away by keeper David Ospina but the Elephants were the architects of their own downfall a few moments later.

Die was caught in possession and Gutierrez released substitute Quintero to slot in.

The Africans, who will be without makeshift centre-back Didier Zokora for their final group match against Greece after he picked up a second booking of the competition, raised themselves and reduced the deficit.

Gervinho cut into the Colombia box from the left flank and, after dancing past three tackles, drove in a shot.

The Ivorians pressed for an equaliser and Drogba was almost through on goal late on after a Mario Yepes mistake, only for keeper Ospina to rush out of his goal, clear the danger and ensure Colombia secured consecutive World Cup wins for the first time.

Colombia coach Jose Pekerman:

""It is, of course, a huge pleasure to see Colombia coming to this level.

""First of all, we are at the World Cup after such a long period of time, and then having enjoyed consecutive victories with players who are here for the first time, so they are all very positive situations for us.

""However, we cannot start thinking ahead of time or what might be coming later on.""

Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi:

""I am not obsessed with Didier Drogba. If you look at the team, I have seen very interesting things from my players.

""It is just a few details that we missed, and that meant we lost the game.""

He added: ""My players did not deserve to lose, a draw would have been more deserved.

""It was a very experienced Colombian team who waited for us to make mistakes, unfortunately we made some and were hit in a hard way.""

Story of the match:

England on verge of elimination

Suarez scores twice for Uruguay

Rooney equalises with 15 minutes left

England out unless Italy beat Costa Rica

Luis Suarez left England on the brink of a World Cup exit as his brace gave Uruguay victory in Sao Paulo.

The Liverpool striker was making his return after a month out following knee surgery - and it proved to be bad timing for England as his brilliance was the difference in a fiercely-fought encounter.

Analysis ""The lads will be gutted. The second goal was a nightmare, a straight ball down the middle. It is schoolboyish. You have to make sure these things don't happen. We got ourselves back in the game and I would have taken a point. It wasn't to be at the end and we let ourselves down.""

Suarez put Uruguay ahead with a first-half header then scored a superb winner six minutes from time after Wayne Rooney's first goal at a World Cup gave England hope of avoiding a second successive Group D loss.

Defeat means the odds are now stacked against Roy Hodgson's England escaping this tough group.

They will be out unless Italy, who beat them in Manaus, defeat Costa Rica on Friday.

England also need Italy to win their final game against Uruguay, which would then give them the chance of qualifying on goal difference if they beat Costa Rica next Tuesday.

But for all the potential, a record of played two, lost two rarely adds up to anything other than elimination at the World Cup. No side have ever progressed after losing their first two matches.

And what an anti-climax it will be for manager Hodgson and his players if England are left playing for nothing other than pride in their final group game in Belo Horizonte.

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez claimed Suarez would not be fully fit for the game against England after missing his country's opening 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica.

Media playback is not supported on this device Luis Suarez heads Uruguay in front against England

Suarez may not have been, but he still possessed too much guile and menace for an England team who never built on the promise they showed in losing to Italy.

Rooney struck the bar before he scored and was England's main threat, but Uruguay - or to be more precise Suarez - produced the quality and clinical finishing that decides games such as this.

As expected, Hodgson played Rooney in a more central role and moved Raheem Sterling wide, but England struggled to find the energy levels that had fuelled such a positive performance against Italy.

Daniel Sturridge and Sterling could not pose the same threat as they had in Manaus either, Instead, it was Rooney who came closest, firing a first-half free-kick just inches wide and then powering a far-post header against the bar from one yard out.

At the back, England looked nervous and were fortunate to survive when Phil Jagielka's sliced clearance fell to Cristian Rodriguez, whose rising drive from the angle just cleared the bar with goalkeeper Joe Hart beaten.

Media playback is not supported on this device Wayne Rooney equalises for England

Uruguay were the more ordered side and their opening goal arrived from the most inevitable source seven minutes before half-time.

Steven Gerrard conceded possession in midfield and, from Edinson Cavani's perfect cross, Suarez pulled away from Jagielka to head past Hart.

As England heads dropped, the former Ajax forward celebrated with the Uruguayan medical team who have nursed him back to fitness.

England, as they did against Italy, responded strongly, forcing Uruguay keeper Fernando Muslera to block a Sturridge effort at his near post.

In a chaotic start to the second half, Suarez was wasteful and Cavani was guilty of a bad miss.

Rooney then found room in the area only eight yards out, but shot straight at Muslera.

Hodgson, knowing what defeat would mean, made his first change after 64 minutes by sending on Ross Barkley for Sterling, who had struggled to impose himself on Uruguay as he had against the Italians.

England were moving into desperate times as the clock ran down - and it was Rooney who produced the goods with the equaliser 15 minutes from time, tapping in from close range from Glen Johnson's perfect cross.

Just as the momentum looked to be shifting towards England, Suarez was the tormentor again.

He latched on to a long punt from Muslera, which Gerrard could only flick on with his head, and then steadied himself before rifling an unstoppable finish past Hart.

It was the final word on this game - and probably on England's 2014 World Cup hopes in Brazil.

418,"Special, secluded and surprisingly luxurious, treehouses are no longer just for kids. Here are five wooden creations for grown-ups to lay claim to.

Châteaux dans les Arbes, France: The fairytale one

As if a secluded hideaway in the trees wasn’t enough of a childhood dream come true, at Châteaux dans les Arbes in the Dordogne, the leafy abodes are also miniature castles. Housed around the former moat of a ruined stronghold, the three creations are the handiwork of veteran treehouse-builder Rémi, who modelled them on (and named them after) nearby châteaux. From ‘Monbazillac’, with its steep turrets, to ‘Hautefort’, which has wooden spires, a footbridge and even an inner courtyard, they’re certainly deserving of their ‘château’ monicker.

A stay here is at the more regal end of treehouse experiences. Guests can survey the surrounding countryside in the hot tubs found on each terrace, while the erstwhile moat is now the site of an infinity pool. Other luxury services on offer include massages, gourmet meals prepared by the on-site chef, and hampers, delivered, the way breakfast is, via a Rapunzel-esque rope-and-basket system.

Back at ground level are the classic attractions of the Dordogne, not least its wealth of full-sized châteaux. A distinctive way to travel is by gabare, or traditional wooden barge, down the Dordogne river, taking in white-stone villages, thick woodlands and rolling meadows as you go. The wine region of Bergerac is a good place to sample this area’s famously fine food and drink.

Chole Mjini, Tanzania: The castaway one

Chole Mjini, which means ‘Chole City’, could hardly be a more ironic name for the cluster of seven treehouses cradled by the canopies of baobab trees on Chole, a tropical island-off-an-island east of the Tanzanian coast. Perched amongst vegetation and crumbling ruins – a legacy of the island’s 19th-century heyday as a trading post – the log-framed, thatched huts look like the wildly inventive creations of marooned voyagers, and staying in one feels about as removed from urban life as it’s possible to be. Beyond the reach of electricity, phone signal or even roads (though there is hot water for showers), they’re perfectly placed to appreciate the peace of the island, from the sound of the waves lapping against the nearby shore to panoramic views of the sun setting over the ocean.

Guests dine on the beach or amongst the ruins, with meals – which have a distinct Swahili influence – lit by candelight, while the rooftop bar has a deck for observing the star-speckled sky. Beyond Chole Mjini is Chole village, where boatmakers craft traditional dhows as they have done for centuries, and there are 13th-century ruins to explore on adjacent islands. Chole is part of the largest marine park in east Africa, and snorkelling here takes in some of the finest coral reefs in the Indian Ocean. Guests can also swim with whale sharks, or observe hawksbill and green turtles hatching on the nearby Mafia Island.

Bangkok Treehouse, Thailand: The urban one

The turbocharged city of Bangkok makes an unexpectedly tranquil location for a treehouse – or 12. In the city’s southeast, just beyond the built-up neighbourhoods and busy roads of the centre, is Bang Krachao, a near-island carved by a loop of the Chao Phraya river. Known as the city’s green lung, it’s a place of mangrove, palm and fruit trees, threaded with waterways, semi-rural villages and centuries-old temples hidden in its midst.

Presiding over the river are the dozen mid-air hideaways that comprise the eco-conscious Bangkok Treehouse. Eleven of these are sleek cabins with living rooms and roof terraces, but the most minimalist – and magical – is the ‘View with a Room’. Perched seven metres high, its panoramic views over the river and jungle are untroubled by such traditional architectural trappings as walls or a ceiling. Instead, two bamboo platforms house a large, canopied double bed and an area for lounging and eating.

A fair bit of time up here is likely to be spent ogling the views: colourful dawns, sunsets flaming over a fringe of palms as boats drift by below, nights illuminated by the soft glow of fireflies – all accompanied by the singsong and chatter of cicadas and birds.

There are plenty of ways to take in Bang Krachao’s unique surroundings, such as swimming in the hotel’s natural pool or borrowing one of the bikes available for guests’ use and cycling the maze of paths that criss-cross the jungle and waterways. A floating market, botanical gardens and Buddhist temples are all a short ride away.

And, should you wish to escape the peace for an hour or two, the historic sights, lively streetlife and exuberant nightlife of Bangkok proper are just across the river.

Free Spirit Spheres, Canada: The modern one

The Free Spirit Spheres are suspended in the canopy by a spider’s web of stretchy ropes, hanging like giant Christmas tree decorations in the temperate rainforest of Vancouver Island. The smooth, wooden pods are designed to co-exist with their surroundings, and have minimum impact on the trees and wildlife. Creature comforts, including bathrooms and a sauna, are back on solid ground, while beyond the forest are the wineries and artisan eateries of the Cowichan Valley. Further afield are wilder thrills like the skiing of Mount Washington and whale-watching off the island’s coast.

Bagthorpe Hall, England: The stately one

The average treehouse may be a loveably DIY affair cobbled together from nails and bits of wood, but the humble hideaway has long appealed to luxurious tastes. Roman Emperor Caligula held lavish feasts in a plane tree, while the Medici family decked out treechambers with marble fountains. The treehouse at Bagthorpe Hall in Norfolk takes its cue from this venerable tradition. Located within a shady copse of oaks in the grounds of a country house, it’s a spacious mini-house with a king-sized four-poster bed and large copper bath, as well as a wide veranda with views over the surrounding parkland. Modern technology is conspicuously absent, with no TV, radio or wi-fi to puncture guests’ sense of seclusion. Around it there are 50 acres of nature to roam while a short drive away are the royal estate of Sandringham and the silky dunes, basking seals and picturesque harbour towns of the north Norfolk coast.

419,"Good food always makes for a good trip – but is it ever worth travelling halfway across the world for a single meal? Some gastronomically minded Quora.com users think so, having journeyed more than 1,000 miles just to taste the perfect dish.

In response to the question “How far have you ever travelled for a meal?” the restaurants worth packing a suitcase for were surprisingly diverse. As expected, a few world-famous eateries popped up in the answers, but just as many travellers mentioned hole-in-the wall spots for comfort food that is impossible to find anywhere else in the world.

Here are a few of our favourite spots mentioned and the sometimes staggering distances distances that were traversed to get there.

Three Ways House Hotel, Gloucestershire, England

Distance travelled: 1,172km

Makiko Itoh drove all the way from Zurich to this old-fashioned hotel in southwestern England for its famous Pudding Club. As the name suggests, the meal involves trying seven different types of British-style pudding over the course of the evening.

“Just like Fight Club, the Pudding Club has rules,” Itoh explained. “Only one pudding allowed on the plate at a time. You must clean your plate before going up for seconds. You cannot go up to the Pudding Station out of turn, only when your table is called.”

After the three-hour affair, diners vote on their favourite pudding, which includes varieties such as sticky toffee, apple, mincemeat and syrup sponge. The style with the most votes at the end of that year is designated “Pudding of the Year”. The hotel holds the club every Friday night, though reservations need to be made far in advance.

Char Hung Sut, Honolulu, Hawaii

Distance travelled: 2,558 miles

Garrick Saito has family and friends in Hawaii, but when he went back for the first time in 15 years last year from Los Angeles, his first stop was hole-in-the-wall Char Hung Sut. Known for their dim sum-style treats, the restaurant is most famous for its manapua, which Saito described as “a unique blend of Chinese style barbeque pork and other spices stuffed into a steamed bun”.

Taillevent, Paris, France

Distance travelled: 5,726 miles

Founded in 1946, this three-star Michelin restaurant proved itself worthy of a journey from Portland, Oregon, to Paris, France. “The food was wonderful, including a caviar appetizer with the most exquisitely cooked egg I’ve ever seen,” Stephanie Vardavas said. “But the service was the real revelation: attentive without being overbearing, thoughtful and caring without the fake friendliness you get in American restaurants much of the time.”

Scotty’s Broasted Chicken and Ribs, Lake Havasu City, Arizona

Distance travelled: 330 miles

Ariel Williams loves the food at this down-home diner so much, she not only buys a full rack of ribs when she arrives, but also takes two to go when she returns home to Tucson, Arizona. “The ribs are so tender, the meat falls off the bone as you pick it up,” she said. “The [fried] chicken is so juicy, you need goggles. My first time eating there, I cut one open and one of the chicken breasts squirted me in the eye!”

El Bulli, Catalonia, Spain

Distance travelled: 6,400km

Though this three-star Michelin restaurant is no longer open, two Quora users made the journey just to eat its molecular haute cuisine. As Norm Soley from Toronto mentioned, the restaurant received nearly one million reservation requests for only 8,000 meals served each year – so getting lucky enough to land a reservation meant dropping everything and going.

“Easily the best meal I’ve had in my life,” said Chris Carpenter, who travelled 1,500km from Dublin for the opportunity. “Really amazing food.”

Chef Ferran Adria has said that the former restaurant will reopen as a culinary exploration centre in 2014.",Meals worth crossing the world for,http://www.bbc.com,[Lindsey Galloway],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1g/6r/p01g6r6r.jpg,2013-09-05 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130905-meals-worth-crossing-the-world-for
420,"With a motto like “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas”, it is no surprise that Sin City has it fair share of secrets, especially when it comes to winning on the casino floor. That said, a few savvy travellers on question-and-answer site Quora.com were brave enough to break the code of silence and share a few things that casinos will not tell you about gambling in Las Vegas.

Drinking alcohol is a sure way to lose

Though many travellers might count the free booze as a perk of gambling in Vegas, plying players with drinks is clear house strategy. “Unless you’re some kind of alcoholic prodigy, your alcohol intake is going to impair your judgement and perceptions,” said Jon Mixon, who grew up in Nevada. “If you want to win, you’ll need to be a teetotaller.”

Every game has a house edge, save one

Quora answerers reiterated over and over again that the house has an edge on every game – but they vary by type. Users Ilya Veygman, a software engineer in Menlo Park, California, and Jenn Tseng, a hotel operations professional in Las Vegas, agreed that roulette has by far the worst odds of the popular table games. While the generally accepted house edge is 5% for a double-zero roulette wheel, 1.4 % for the pass line in craps (the game’s standard bet) and only 0.28% for blackjack, Mixon mentioned that the smaller casinos in Vegas might have slightly better odds, as they cannot afford to retain the best dealers.

As for the game with the best odds, Don Dawson, a Las Vegas resident, suggested live poker. “All other games favour the house. It’s the only game where the casino does not take money directly from the player,” he said. “It is strictly up to you and your skill on how much you win or lose.”

You must play “max bet” on slots to win big

“If you play slots, there’s no point playing the lowest bet,” said Tseng. “Max bet = max win.” The maximum bet is usually two or three times the advertised price; for example, the maximum bet on a 25 cent machine will usually be 50 or 75 cents.

Casinos are built to disorient

It can be a challenge to find your way out of a casino once you find your way in. “Casino floors are labyrinthine by design,” said Veygman. “You get lost because you’re supposed to, then you grab a seat at a slot machine or blackjack, and voila! You drop some cash gambling.”

For the same reason, you will never see a clock in a casino. “They don’t want you to say, ‘It’s getting late. Time to turn in,’” said Garrick Saito, a Los Angeles resident. “The longer you play, the more likely it is you’ll lose.”

Win, then walk away

According to every respondent, the only real way to take home cold hard cash from Vegas is by stopping while you are ahead. “You are only going to win once or twice during your entire stay,” said Mixon. “When you do, stand up and leave. If you don’t, you’ll end up losing it all back – with interest.”",What Las Vegas casinos won’t tell you about gambling,http://www.bbc.com,[Lindsey Galloway],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1h/1q/p01h1qtp.jpg,2013-09-19 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130919-what-las-vegas-casinos-wont-tell-you-about-gambling
421,"Some cities around the world are intrinsically tied to their harbours, coastlines and bays, their geographic location shaping the way they develop and how their residents interact with the urban landscape and with each other.

Taken from “world’s best” lists in publications such as Travel + Leisure and organisations like Project for Public Spaces, these five cities combine fantastic waterfronts with generously-sized parks, top-notch restaurants and cultural musts, making them truly wonderful places to live, work and visit.

Stockholm, Sweden

Only one third of the Swedish capital is actually city: the rest is water and parkland spread across 14 islands in Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. Much of the waterfront is easily accessible, from paths and pedestrian areas to the ferries that crisscross the archipelago. Since so much of Stockholm is on the water, almost every neighbourhood is close to the coastline. One of the most sought-after districts is hip Södermalm just south of Gamla stan, the medieval Old Town. Within Södermalm, SoFo (South of Folkungagatan) is known for its trendy shops, cafes and nightlife, and the area around Mariatorget is full of houses with lake views. Also very desirable is calm Kungsholmen, located across Riddarfjärdern bay from Gamla stan, and exclusive Östermalm to the northeast.

The majority of residents own property, and most rentals are sublets as the municipal rental queue is decades long. Although the market is up, the International Monetary Fund recently warned that Sweden is in a housing bubble and warned against low-amortisation mortgages (payments that do not cover the amount of interest due). A townhouse in a popular neighbourhood can cost anywhere from 21.5 million Swedish krona to 43 million SEK, and a less grand single-family house in a popular neighbourhood costs anywhere from 4.3 million SEK to 8.6 million SEK. Most of the available properties are condos and flats, and a typical two-bedroom flat costs around 4.3 million SEK. A three-bed in the city centre around the Old Town rents for around 15,500 SEK a month.

Hamburg, Germany

In addition to its large working port, this city on the Elbe River has more canals than Venice or Amsterdam and the most bridges of any city around the globe, more than 2,000 of them. Water is all around, as are green spaces and parks – in fact, Hamburg was named European Green Capital in 2011. Areas near the water are very popular with home buyers, including the riverside districts of Blankenese and Othmarschen, located west of the city centre in the borough of Altona. Parallel to the river is Elbchaussee, the grand boulevard that runs west from the neighbourhood of Altona-Atlstadt out to Blankenese and is very desirable for its beautiful architecture and views. Around Binnenalster (Inner Alster) and Aussenalster (Outer Alster) – the two urban lakes – the area of Harvestehude is popular, as are Winterhude and Uhlenhorst for their central location.

Many families look to live in peaceful Alsterdorf in the northeast because of its green spaces and good transport links to the city centre. One of the largest urban developments in Europe, HafenCity, was built right on the harbour, similar to London’s Docklands, and is popular for its location and modern infrastructure. According to the Engel & Völkers 2013 market report, a desirable waterfront house in these areas can cost as much as 15 million euros, while a 90sqm flat sells from 4,500 euros per square metre. Rentals in popular areas – such as a four-room flat in Harvestehude – can reach 25 euros per square metre, while rents in less popular locations cost around 13 to 17 euros per square metre.

Nice, France

Nice is a key player in the allure of the Cote d’Azur; the French Riviera jewel has been the playground of the rich and the privileged for more than a century. Along the seafront, the long curve of the Promenade des Anglais follows the beach, connecting the airport and the harbour, and is the perfect spot for people watching with views of the Mediterranean and the Old Town’s Belle Époque structures. In the summer, the super yachts moor nearby, adding to the glamour. “Be it a middle manager from Dusseldorf or a Russian oligarch, they all basically crave the sun in a safe environment, where you can access glitzy Cannes and Monaco or the olive groves and inland villages,” said Alex Balkin, a broker at Savills French Riviera. “Today, the high end of the market is dominated mainly by buyers from Eastern Europe.”

Nice’s most popular areas to live are the Promenade des Anglais, the Quai des Etats-Unis (the boulevard fronting the Old Town), and the Boulevard Franck Pilatte to the east, due to their Mediterranean views and 19th-century architecture. Housing styles range from Belle Époque apartments to modern residences with swimming pools and downtown seafront houses. A mint-condition two-bedroom apartment in these sought-after locations costs between 400,000 and 800,000 euros. A similar property rents for between 1,500 and 2,500 euros a month.

Sydney, Australia

Sydney is synonymous with its harbour, home to such iconic structures as the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge as well as Bondi and Manly Beaches. In fact, it is the proximity to beaches that draws so many people from around Australia and the world, who move to the city for its easygoing lifestyle, sophisticated culture, world-class restaurants, and of course, stunning views. “Certainly anything on the harbourfront with a view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or Opera House is seen, not only locally, but globally as being extremely desirable,” said Shayne Harris, head of residential at Savills Australia. “It is the reason why such high prices can be achieved for these properties when they do become available.”

Blessed with riverfront, harbour-front or oceanfront settings, some of the city’s most popular areas include Vaucluse, north of Bondi Beach; leafy, upscale Double Bay and exclusive Point Piper, two adjacent areas on the south side of the harbour; and Hunters Hill, one of the city’s oldest residential areas, west of the harbour. These homes tend to be some of the most expensive in Sydney. There are no houses directly on the harbour in the CBD, but there are many apartment buildings with stellar views and equally stellar prices. “A two bedroom apartment in Macquarie Street that was not waterfront, but overlooked Circular Quay sold earlier this year for 3,050,000 Australian dollars,” said Harris. The 2013 median house price in Vaucluse is A$3.9 million, while in Hunters Hill it is around A$1.1 million. In Point Piper, where there are huge estates, the median price is $19.8 million. The rent for a two-bedroom flat in Vaucluse is A$2,290 a month or up to A$3,200 a month if it has a view of the water. The average monthly rent in Point Piper it is A$3,000, and A$1,800 in Hunters Hill.

San Francisco

The City on the Bay sits on a peninsula with the Pacific Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other. The Golden Gate Bridge soars across the mouth of the bay, connecting the city to Marin County, while the Bay Bridge connects to Oakland in the east. From the sea lions sunning themselves on the pilings at Fisherman’s Wharf to swimmers and strollers taking advantages of the many parks and promenades, life in this city is centred on the water. The many hills have astonishing views of the blue bay, skyline, and on some days, the fog rolling in. “Home buyers in San Francisco are willing to pay top dollar to have a glimpse of stunning vistas in neighbourhoods perched high atop the city,” said Betty Taisch, the San Francisco Association of Realtors president elect.

The Marina District, close to the Presidio and Fisherman’s Wharf, has access to waterfront activities such as swimming and sailing and the Aquatic Park Historic District, as do nearby Russian Hill and Presidio Heights . Many properties in these neighbourhoods have classic Victorian architecture, with views of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. The median price for a single-family home in the Marina is $4.15 million, while the median price for a condo is around $1.16 million. A rental apartment in the Marina starts at around $4,500 a month. In Russian Hill, the median price for a house is $2.5 million and rents start around $3,000 a month. To the east, the new and up-and-coming neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and South Beach are vibrant and walkable. A condo in Mission Bay starts around $1.5 million and rents start $3,500. In the west of the city, Outer Sunset and Outer Richmond have great access to Ocean Beach, a wide sandy expanse on the Pacific Ocean. The average house price is $856,000 and rents start around $2,800.",Living in: Great waterfront cities,http://www.bbc.com,[Sunshine Flint],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1h/dr/p01hdrj3.jpg,2013-09-24 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130924-living-in-great-waterfront-cities
422,"Submerged caves off the Yucatan Peninsula hide gems for divers and archaeologists alike – including cathedral-like caverns, a 10,000-year-old boy and Mayan skulls.

423,"In recent years, Fort Tilden State Park has gone from being an obscure stretch of sand on the far end of New York City’s Rockaway Peninsula to a favourite among beachgoers, its wild dunes and unkempt beach a rarity in a city of millions. Closed since November 2012 due to severe damage from Hurricane Sandy, the Queens park is set to reopen at some point during this summer’s public beach season, which begins Memorial Day weekend – good news for sunbathers, and for intrepid adventurers keen on accessing the abandoned US military fortifications nearby.

You see, most beachgoers tend not to notice the true treasures at this former US Army Coast Artillery Post, which was established in 1917 and used until its weaponry – including smooth-bore cannons, 16in naval rifles and Hercules air defence missiles – became obsolete in 1974. A few steps from Fort Tilden’s beach sits a blue rectangular concrete shell, roughly 10ft high, displaying the first verse of My Country Tis of Thee (a US anthem sung to the tune of God Save the Queen) hand-painted in red-and-white. A ladder on the roof leads down to a concrete stand for machine guns; a narrow, eye-level slit looks out onto the sea.

The WWII-era pillbox, as it is called, was built to defend the United States from enemy boats that, thanks to war remaining at a safe distance, never reached its shores. But despite its proximity to the beach, it goes mostly unnoticed, said Geoff Grandberg, who runs the urban adventure tour company Spelunk NYC. “People walk past this all the time. Nobody thinks it’s anything,” Grandberg said. “The most beautiful places are right in front of you, but who looks back?”

Urban exploration, or urban spelunking, has become a blanket term for the act of adventuring to normally unseen parts of a city. Often such places are abandoned or off-limits, and gaining entrance can mean running across subway tracks, crawling down storm drains or climbing up bridges, illegally.

Grandberg, a tech professional and avid urban explorer, wanted to give people the opportunity to see hidden New York without the risk of arrest, injury, or death. So he started Spelunk NYC, a company that gives legal tours of lesser-known places across the city. On each of his tours, which generally have around five stops at varying sites, visitors can both enjoy the adrenaline rush of accessing a rarely seen place – and ensure that they are neither breaking the law by trespassing, nor putting themselves in danger.

“I’m in it for the ornate structures, something that breathes energy from another era,” he said at the beginning of our tour. “And we’re going to find that in where we’re going today, not by tearing open fences or climbing a bridge.”

Tours start in the morning at low tide, when the water remains shallow enough to stroll through the muck at Staten Island’s Witte Marine Scrap Yard.

At the boat graveyard, as it’s commonly called, the mammoth corpses of about 100 extinct vessels rest in relative peace, half-sunken and slowly deteriorating. Wandering through this industrial wasteland of giant freighters and wooden hulls is more than eerie and imposing; without a guide, it could be treacherous. These once powerful forces of industry sit on an unstable marsh, and if you don’t know which way you’re going, one wrong step can mean slicing yourself open on one of the countless sharp objects, or worse, getting stuck and finding yourself in an inescapable situation when the tide comes in. That’s not to mention the legal dangers: Grandberg makes sure to stay in the public section, but a few steps in the wrong direction could mean trespassing.

While one stop on the tour is where machines come to die, another is where they return to life. Hangar B at Brooklyn’s Floyd Bennett Field is like a living museum, home to a full-time aircraft restoration project where aging WWII veterans make 60-year-old aeroplanes look brand new. Particularly lucky guests might even get to hop inside a 1950s aeroplane or helicopter for a photo op.

With Fort Tilden’s re-opening, Grandberg plans to once again make the park the tour’s final stop, taking groups through an artillery shed, a massive concrete gun emplacement and the pillbox, catching sight of M-16 racks inside freshly graffitied walls and deteriorating ceilings. All of the stops on a Spelunk NYC tour are completely legal – they’re just hidden in plain sight from a city that moved too fast for the structures to keep up, and people who move too quickly to look at what’s right in front of them.

Perhaps when beachgoers start to rediscover Fort Tilden this summer, they’ll uncover what’s been there all along.",Abandoned New York City,http://www.bbc.com,[Brad Cohen],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1x/6s/p01x6s3g.jpg,2014-03-27 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20140327-abandoned-new-york
424,"Human skin becomes a blank canvas for the world’s top body painters as artists from 45 countries compete against each other in Pörtschach, Austria this summer.

The World Bodypainting Festival, this year held from 29 June to 6 July, celebrates the unique art of painting directly on the human body – with models transformed into head-to-toe masterpieces, depicting anything from alien-like appendages to fruit-like faces.

The competition takes place across multiple categories, including sponge paint, airbrushing and face painting, all featuring different techniques and materials to achieve the transformations. In many cases, the models are fully nude, with every inch of their bodies covered in paint (think: a full-body tattoo). Other models wear over-the-top props such as outrageous headgear or wing-like attachments.

Even amateurs can get in on the action, with workshops and lectures that teach the basics of body paint (classes cover topics like “Airbrush for Beginners” and “Zombie Skin”).

A major highlight of the festival is the “Body Circus”, a giant party held on 2 July in the massive halls of Schloss Moosburg, a Gothic-style castle built in 1541. Visitors are encouraged to wear their best fantasy costumes, accented with extreme makeup and, of course, body paint. Stylists are on hand to amp up each costume and the party is spread out across three floors, with dramatically dressed DJs spinning songs on each one.

After the awards ceremony, the festival ends with the “Colour Splash”, another paint-filled party that gets as messy as its name implies. Attendees let loose, smudging paint all over themselves and others – an event that greatly contrasts the perfectly manicured looks curated earlier in the week.",Bizarre body painting in Austria,http://www.bbc.com,[Lindsey Galloway],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1x/r9/p01xr96q.jpg,2014-04-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20140414-bizarre-body-painting-in-austria
425,"“Clock-clock-clock-clock-KUHwhoomp!” That was the sound of the Biblio-Mat, a one-of-a-kind refrigerator-sized book vending machine, as it dispensed random titles for $2 Canadian. It was tucked into the back of Monkey’s Paw, a small rare books shop in Toronto that displayed a collection including, when I browsed there last May, a 1965 shopping directory of India, a pictorial history of the carousel, a volume of “gesture poems” and a 1955 booklet of cake recipes made with the “new Kraft Oil Method”.

The vending machine was merely a clever way to sell bargain bin titles, but I’ve never been more thrilled to receive a book I didn’t particularly want. I lugged my heavy, spine-ripped volume of the Romance of Medicine all the way back home and gifted it to my brother-in-law, a doctor.

“Cool,” he said after opening it. I told him where and how it was purchased. “Cool,” he said again.

I had to agree. As far as Toronto’s coolness goes, that’s just the start. After all, the definitive, if circular logic of coolness is that cool things don’t need to convince anyone. They don’t even care. Because they’re cool.

That’s why Toronto is cool: it has been for a long time, and since it doesn’t feel the need to advertise the fact, most of the world doesn’t even know. Canada in general is understated in this way; it’s not very Canadian to point out one’s own awesomeness. Toronto is so cool, it might not even know it is.

“That’s a good one!” laughed Monkey’s Paw owner, Stephen Fowler, when I asked him about the city’s transition to urban hipness. “I first came here [on vacation] from San Francisco, known as a cool city, in 1998,” he said. “I was expecting to find the most boring city in North America.” Instead, he found it was indeed “cool”. Surprised to be proven wrong, he moved to Toronto four years later.

Compared to the architecture and French culture of Montreal or the beauty found surrounding Vancouver, Toronto has never been particularly alluring. Tucked into the northwest corner of Lake Ontario, one of North America’s Great Lakes, the charm of Toronto is found in microcosms of hipness: in relaxing coffee houses, arty hotels, eclectic shops and quiet bars. None are obvious. All must be sought out.



After checking into the Drake Hotel, a warren of 19 “dens”, “salons”, “crash pads” and a single suite, each with a Wes Anderson aesthetic, I found my key didn’t work. Back at the front desk – which loans hotel guests indie-rock -loaded iPods and hotel themed DVDs such as Four Rooms, Faulty Towers and Psycho – the front desk clerk gave me a new key, plus a free drink token at the bar. The hotel’s Lounge, which staged the Canadian debut of many 1980s punk bands, has a wall piled with old hi-fi stereo equipment and an ambitious drinks menu. I sipped the candy-sweet Deliverance, made with cedar-infused bourbon, apple brandy, Fernet Branco, apple liqueur and (the reason I picked it) Canadian maple syrup. Back in my home of Brooklyn, New York, this combination of highly inventive cocktails and meticulously arranged décor would be fly paper for moustachioed hipsters sporting diminutive hats and tartan vests. Instead, as I sipped my Deliverance, an all-ages, hockey apparel-clad crowd cheered as a game played on a big screen above the fireplace.

My room, decorated with clunky metal chairs and a 1960s-era desk, also came with a “pleasure menu” of erotic toys and films – plus a copy of The World’s Coolest Hotel Rooms, which, in a surprising bit of braggadocio, featured the Drake. Less cool about the Drake: walls are thin enough to hear other guests enjoying their orders from the “menu”.

Earlier that day, I took a light rail street car across downtown to the Rooster Coffee House, a small space with a communal table serving fresh, filling baked goods – including a drool-worthy blueberry scone – and high-end Intelligentsia coffee in charmingly mismatched mugs. On my commute I passed the TIFF Bell Lightbox, host of the Toronto International Film Festival, famed for picking movies that win Oscars.

Canada’s largest city has surprisingly few global chains. The exception is Starbucks, which has an outpost on nearly every downtown block, but why anyone would go to one is a mystery when the city has so many exceptional local franchises. At the bright and airy Dark Horse Espresso Bars you’re as likely to find small groups playing cards as typing on laptops. Then there is Balzac’s, a small chain located in unique, at times historic, locations around town. The one I visited was housed inside a 1800s pump house in the Distillery District, where I sipped a bowl-sized café au lait from a balcony overlooking an enormous chandelier.

My favourite coffeehouse was Kensington Market’s Café Panemar, with its retro-meets-industrial steampunk style, including track lighting of copper plumbing tubes. While devouring an indulgent chocolate cream cheese cookie under a large vintage “Viewing Booths 25¢” sign, I had my only hipster sighting in a three-day visit. There he was in a suit jacket, short tweed pants, 1940s-thin tie and leather satchel bag, with hair and glasses that seemed lifted from This American Life radio show host – and hipster demi-god – Ira Glass. He looked completely, ridiculously out of place and apparently word is spreading. Nonetheless I promised myself to come back during warmer weather, when the café opens its garage door walls to outdoor seating.

Panemar’s pipe lighting system could have been purchased at Metropolis Living, a large collection of refurbished and new furniture, functional art and you-name-it, located in a west Toronto area called The Junction, just north of the nearly 400-acre High Park. The first thing that caught my eye was a massive lamp – if you could call it that – made from an actual street lamp post. Then I was distracted by the vintage top hats, antique shaving chairs, glass hospital grade syringes, old prosthetics, phrenology busts, group portraits of 1920s mining camps and a plastic frog dissection kit. A nearby warehouse, Metropolis Factory, housed the bigger items, such as café signs and old timey stage lights.

As a fan of Monocle, the magazine publishing and broadcasting upstart that is a darling of the global literati, I couldn’t resist visiting the Monocle shop of overpriced sweaters, stationery and framed infographics. By choosing Toronto over Montreal or Vancouver as its only Canadian store location, Monocle has given the city its rarefied seal of approval.

I browsed through my Biblio-Mat purchase at barVolo, a bar of wooden communal tables below ornate brass lamps. It had two dozen beers on tap, many Canadian, including an outstanding cask-pulled Lone Pine IPA by an Ontario brewer called Sawdust City. I paired it with a warm, buttery pretzel, cheese board and various pickled bits and bobs, including zucchini and an egg. The night before, I drank my dinner with co-workers at Weslodge Saloon, which describes itself as a “modern air-cooled saloon” but reminded me of a Victorian hunting lodge with tiny lamps, gilded frames and laughable leather gun holsters worn by the staff. The beer options were decent, including some quality microbrews; and the jalapeño poppers, in which only one of every sixth pepper was fiery, made for a fun edible Russian roulette.

It was over dinner at Weslodge that I explained the origin of my theory that Toronto was anonymously cool. My wife and I had recently seen the 2011 film Take This Waltz by indie sweetheart and Toronto native Sarah Polley. Despite starring Michelle Williams and Seth Rogan, and having a deeply engrossing plot, no one seems to have heard of the movie. And as we watched it, pulled in by the melancholy ebb and flow of the characters’ complicated love lives, we kept asking ourselves, “What city is that? It looks so cool. I want to go there!”

We waited through the credits to be surprised by the answer.

While staying at the artist-designed, 37-room boutique Gladstone Hotel in the lively West Queen West neighbourhood, I used the iPad supplied in my motorcycle-themed room to look up exactly where Take This Waltz was filmed. The characters’ block of charming porch-fronted houses looked like where I’d want to live if I was lucky enough to spend more than two nights in Toronto. After a little digging I found the house; it was only a few blocks away. As I walked there, I played the song’s bittersweet anthem, The Buggles’ Video Killed the Radio Star, and standing outside the currently lived-in home from the film, I could only think of one word to describe the experience.

426,"Lebanon’s limestone cave system, the Jeita Grotto, is one of the longest caves in the Middle East, spanning 9km across the Nahr-al-Kalb valley. But the awe-inspiring site has rarely been photographed; all cameras are prohibited in part because the frequent flashes of light may harm the grotto's hundreds of naturally formed hanging crystals.

In December 2013, Dutch wakeboarder and Red Bull-sponsored athlete Duncan Zuur had the rare opportunity to wakeboard through the warm waters of the stalactite- and stalagmite-filled Jeita Grotto. The result is a stunning video that illustrates Zuur’s athletic skill and brings to life the grotto’s truly spectacular environment.

In the video, Zuur glides across emerald-coloured waters and skids off boat ramps set specifically for the once-in-a-lifetime ride. “I stopped thinking about riding because there was so much beauty from around a world I’ve never seen,” Zuur said, describing his surreal experience.

Composed of an approximately 2,000m-long upper region, and a 6,000m-long lower region, the Jeita Grotto also acts as the main source for Beirut’s fresh drinking water. Once only accessible by boat through an underground river, the Jeita’s upper region now has an access tunnel and a series of walkways where travellers can witness the stalactites and stalagmites without disturbing the natural landscape.

Zuur and the Red Bull staff had to work closely with Jeita Grotto’s site curators, using special lightning techniques and production equipment to protect the grotto’s natural composition. Dr Nabil Haddad, the manager of Jeita Grotto who worked alongside Red Bull, said the video was the perfect opportunity to highlight Jeita Grotto’s stunning nature. “We are at a very unique location, one that is very hard to depict by mere words,” Haddad said. “The camera will now be able to give this place what it deserves.”

427,"Do you remember your first flight? For many of us at BBC Travel, the answer is no. We’ve taken to the skies so often that the trips seem to merge into one – and some of us have been flying since before we can even remember.

But in this extremely heartwarming video of two Dutch grandmothers taking to the skies for the first time, we’re instantly reminded of how amazing it is to soar through the air and look down on the vast beauty of our world.

Despite being a part of a Vodaphone ad campaign, the video provides an incredibly touching and inspirational story.

It pairs adventurous Ria, a spunky 78 year old who always wanted to fly but was married to a man who never would, with An, a cautious 72 year old whose husband could never convince her to face her fear of flying. Ria is ready to jump on the plane straight away, while An worries about everything that can go wrong. But it’s their opposite personalities that bring the two women, who’d never met, so close together; and the result is an uplifting display of their emotional journey – from fear to excitement, and finally, to an appreciation of flying that is so genuine it brought tears to our eyes.

The piece really takes off about six minutes in, but the interviews with the women earlier in the video are equally adorable.

“1,000km… Holy Moly! To me, driving a car at 140km per hour is fast enough!”

“There will be clouds, of course… at least that’s what I’ve heard, that you fly through them.”

“If you don’t know what it is, there’s no reason to be afraid.""

429,"Double the size of Texas and triple the size of Germany, New Caledonia’s recently established Le Parc Naturel de la Mer De Corail (The Natural Park of the Coral Sea), has been named the world’s largest marine park. Established just two weeks ago, it is the largest existing protected area – both on land and sea – at a staggering 1,300,000sqkm.

Besides its massive size, the oceanic sanctuary in the South Pacific is home to a vast array of marine life, hosting 48 different shark species, 25 mammal species, 19 nesting bird species and five sea turtle species, including the endangered green turtle. Its ocean floors are illuminated with more than 1.1 million acres of the vibrant coral reefs that give the sea its name, and its waters provide 3,000 tons of fish to New Caledonia’s inhabitants.

New Caledonia is no stranger to record-breaking sites. Located about 3,000km east of Australia, the remote French territory is home to the Grand Lagon Sud, the world’s biggest lagoon and a Unesco World Heritage Site, as well as to the world’s second largest double-barrier reef, after the one in Australia.

But besides these awe-inspiring locations, New Caledonia also has some of the richest biodiversity on Earth, which is why its government and conservation experts are taking measures to protect the natural treasure before there is a serious threat.

Currently, illegal fishing is the only concern, but potential increases in ship traffic from Queensland, Australia, and the continuance of deep-sea oil mining could harm the aquatic park in the future. Over the next three years, the park will be separated into zones, some of which will be open to economic activities like fishing and tourist activities like snorkeling and swimming.

The park’s preservation marks a historic moment in marine conservation and adds another wondrous site to New Caledonia, making this the perfect time to plan your next South Pacific adventure.",The world’s largest ocean treasure,http://www.bbc.com,[Talia Avakian],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/1z/3d/p01z3d0h.jpg,2014-05-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20140514-the-worlds-largest-ocean-treasure
430,"Russia’s March invasion of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula has not just been a headache for diplomats: it has also been the latest in a series of problems for mapmakers. Should Crimea be shown as Ukrainian? Russian? Disputed?

The US government chose not to change its official maps of the region, because, the US State Department press spokesperson said, “we reject the Russian attempt to annex Crimea”. National Geographic, on the other hand, shaded Crimea grey, its sign of “an area of special status”.

Google’s response may have shown the situation’s complexity the best: at the end of April, the international mapmaker simply produced three different versions. To visitors accessing the site from Ukraine, Google Maps left Crimea as it looked before Russia’s invasion – as a part of Ukraine. But it changed the map for those accessing the Russian version of the site, showing Crimea as separate from Ukraine with a thick line. International visitors, on the other hand, saw a version with a dotted line, the sign of a disputed border.

Now, in an apparent nod to the situation’s increasing intractability, a dotted line has appeared for the Ukrainians – but it is far fainter and less noticeable than the one on the international version.

Mapmaking has always been a complex process, requiring cartographers to weigh political situations, among others, against the needs of their audience.

“People generally assume that, well, science is just objective, and what we do in cartography is represent the world ‘out there’. But it’s never as clear cut,” said Christine Leuenberger, a Cornell University professor who researches politics and cartography. “Maps are always selective. You always have to omit as much as you include. So they’re always political. It’s impossible to construct an apolitical map.”

Borders are not the only sensitive detail. In 2012, Iran’s government threatened to sue Google over its map’s lack of label for the Gulf, which Iranians call the Persian Gulf and Arab countries call the Arabian Gulf. Two years previous, Iran had announced that airlines using in-flight maps with the Arabian Gulf label would not be allowed into Iran’s airspace.

Or take the case of the West Bank. The United Nations – which many mapmakers turn to for direction in how to delineate borders and territories – uses GPS technology to mark exactly where the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank lies. But for some, Leuenberger said, even that isn’t accurate enough. “Palestinian stakeholders say, ‘hey – where you depicted the barrier does not portray the geopolitical reality on the ground, because the barrier is not just a wall and a fence, but part of a segregation zone’,” she said. “So you cannot map the barrier as separate from the checkpoints and no-go areas that are near the barrier. You have to map the whole thing together.”

Given the difficulty, most cartographers have guidelines for determining how to deal with potential complications. US-based mapmaker Rand McNally, for example, changes national borders only when the US State Department recognises a change, although it will shade areas under dispute.

But cartographers with a more international audience, like Google, have to be particularly sensitive. Representing a territory in a certain way might not just irritate customers: it might mean the map doesn’t comply with a region’s regulations and laws – making it illegal, or at least unsellable.

Nokia’s mapmaking platform HERE often has to grapple with this issue, as their GPS maps are in 80% of the world’s cars that have satellite-navigation installed. “In general, we follow the UN,” said Christof Hellmis, vice president of HERE’s Map Platform office. “But if the map doesn't follow local regulations, then of course we support our customers in making the maps locally compliant.”

In order for a car with HERE’s GPS technology to be shipped to China, for example, the maps need to comply with Chinese regulations. “If you ship a map to the rest of the world, Taiwan is not a part of the Republic of China,” Hellmis said. But on cars sent to China, Taiwan is mapped as part of China.

Has the company ever, to the best of his knowledge, refused to make such a change, for ethical reasons or otherwise? “I’m not aware of such a case, to be honest,” Hellmis said.

Even as massive mapmakers grapple with the problems of how to present the world in ways that serve both educational , commercial and political needs, they are running up against new competitors: individuals. Today anyone with web-based software such as Scribblemaps can make their own visions of the world and share them with others. Crowd-sourced cartography is getting hot, too: in late May the company Telenav, which supplies maps to carmakers, said it would switch to OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free editable world map, from its previous suppliers, which had included Nokia and TomTom. Meanwhile, users are even invited to make edits to Google Maps, although updates are reviewed and must be approved before they appear online.

Maps do not just represent our perceptions of the world; they also create them. Approaches like Google Maps, in which Ukrainians see one reality, Russians another, may be commercially wise. But in failing to present one unified representation of the world, they run the risk of reinforcing their customers’ differing realities. If crowd-sourcing is the future of cartography, resulting representations of the world may be more inclusive, unified – and, of course, even more complicated.",The politics of making maps,http://www.bbc.com,[Amanda Ruggeri],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/20/74/p0207494.jpg,2014-06-02 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20140602-the-politics-of-making-maps
431,"We had been riding nonstop for five hours, our mounts alternately cantering through meadows and picking their way through evergreen forest. The land became increasingly bare and mountainous, a forbidding landscape under a leaden sky. On the final descent into the valley we dismounted; easier than inching downhill along the treacherous, muddy slope. I was exhausted.

In the valley we saw a couple of dozen tepees in two clusters, the rising smoke announcing human presence. We were greeted by scores of barking dogs; unlike typical Mongolian strays, these were well-fed Husky-like hunting animals.

My guide, Mishig, and I were ushered into a tepee by an ancient-looking woman wearing a traditional Mongolian deel (kaftan), her weathered face and few remaining teeth telling of a lifetime of hard living. A cauldron of water was boiling and the woman’s daughter made milky tea. I opted to camp next to her tepee. A curious and begrimed little girl attached herself to me, looking up expectantly as I prepared my rehydrated mash and peas. She opened her mouth like a little bird; I spoon-fed her, feeling maternal.

We were visiting the Tsaatan, a tiny, marginalised community of around 500 people who live in the mountains and taiga (swampy coniferous forest) along the Russian border, just north of Mongolia’s Lake Khuvsgul. These reindeer herders are a nomadic tribe, moving from pasture to pasture every five weeks or so in search of lichen that’s essential to the wellbeing of their reindeer. Originally from Russia’s Tuva region and speaking both Mongolian and Tuvan, the process of forced collectivisation during decades of Communism cost the Tsaatan most of their reindeer, and these days their existence is a very precarious one. There are only around 15 to 20 animals left per family, and they supplement their livelihood by fishing, hunting elk and gathering wild berries and potatoes.

I was introduced to Zaya, an English-speaking member of the community, who expertly kneaded dough while chatting to me.

“January to March is the hungriest time for us. To make dumplings for the Tsaagan Sar (White Moon) festival in February we gather the last of our flour and as for the filling, we hope that one of the men has managed to hunt down an elk,” Zaya said.

“Do you eat your reindeer?” I asked.

“Very, very rarely, as we have so few; we need them for the milk and as pack animals.”

These days, the Tsaatan no longer dress in reindeer hides and their tepees are covered with waterproof canvas, but their animals still take care of most their needs.

I followed as Zaya headed across the clearing with a tin pail in her hand. She tied her reindeer’s front legs to stop it from running off and squatted down, milking the animal with quick, practised squeezes. “Reindeer produce only around 300ml per session. We milk them twice a day.” This small amount of milk is then converted into a dry, crumbly, slightly salty cheese. “This is a dying practise, even among the reindeer people. We’ve had some Sámi visitors [from Finland] taking photos to show their grandparents, as they don’t milk reindeer anymore.”

The affection that the Tsaatan feel for their animals is evident, and the community suffers when any of them are killed. “Last week we lost two young reindeer to wolves,” Zaya told me. As we talked, a reindeer poked its head into the opening of the tepee. “That’s Britney Spears; she’s here for her salt lick.” Zaya explained that deer seek out salty mineral deposits to satisfy a craving for nutrients that aren’t found in the grass and lichen they eat. She poured some salt in my hand so that I could feed the members of Led Zeppelin, her other five reindeer. They were very tame and followed me around, pushing their warm muzzles into my hand and peering curiously into my tent.

I asked Zaya about the large cloth bundle that was hanging in the back of her tepee – whether they stored herbs or food in it. She explained that it was a sacred bundle and an intrinsic part of Shamanist rituals that play an important part in Tsaatan lives.

“We bring it out on good days, burn juniper under it as offering in the mornings, and never point our feet at it,” she said. The community has its own shaman, who fulfils a spiritual role as well as that of a healer. “Spirits choose those who become shamans; if you deny your calling, you can become seriously ill.”

Visitors to the community are a sore point. For years Mongolian- and foreigner-run tour companies, mostly based in Ulaanbaatar, have been bringing expeditions here without any consideration of, or benefit to, the Tsaatan. In 2006 the Tsaatan Community and Visitors’ Centre (TCVC) was established in the nearest town of Tsagaannuur with the aim of putting the Tsaatan in charge of visits to their community. For a short time it appeared to have worked, but Zaya said that it’s now back to the status quo, with most companies conducting their tours with utter disregard for the Tsaatan.

“We are happy to have guests as long as they are truly interested in interacting with us and learning about our way of life. We get many tourists who come here without an interpreter, drop trash, wash their dishes in our drinking water and just take photos of us, making us feel as if we’re in a zoo,” she said.

“How would the Tsaatan want the visits to be conducted?” I asked

“Visitors should give us advance warning, like any regular guests. It’s best to bring an interpreter so that they can actually talk to us. Contribute to the community by staying in guest tepees, or purchase handicrafts we make. Also, it’s very important that visitors come on horses that we provide through the TCVC; we’ve had some horses who’d never seen reindeer; one of them freaked out and crippled our reindeer so then she had to be put down.”

In spite of the hardships and the prejudice, the Tsaatan way of life attracts outsiders. A Frenchwoman comes here every summer to visit the sons she had with a Tsaatan man, and Zaya herself is a Mongolian who grew up in Colorado and has been living with the Tsaatan for the past six years.

“Why do you stay?” I asked.

“For love,” she said simply, taking in the tepee she shares with her husband, and the reindeer peering in.

432,"Common sense goes a long way when it comes to learning a country’s proper etiquette. But even the savviest, most observant travellers can make the occasional cultural stumble if they are not careful.

Sam Bruce, a co-founder of the travel site Much Better Adventures, grew up in Hong Kong – yet did not realise until he was much older that in Hong Kong, people should always hand over business cards with two hands. “I had a rather awkward moment where I casually slid my name card face-down across the table to someone at the end of a meeting, when at the very same moment they delivered theirs, bowing, with both hands,” he explained. “What I had done was a big no-no and highly disrespectful.”

To discover more of these unexpected missteps, we sought out the advice of users on question and answer site Quora, asking “What should I absolutely not do when visiting your country?” Here are the etiquette rules that surprised us the most.

The number trap

In some cultures, giving the wrong amount of an item can be worse than no present at all. “Do not give an even numbers of flowers as a gift. That’s for dead folks,” said Muscovite Katherine Makhalova. “A proper bouquet will have one, three, five or seven flowers.” Odd numbers of flowers are given for happy occasions in Russia, while bouquets of two, four, six, 12 or 24 stems are often brought to funerals.

Even outside of Russia, knowing which digits are lucky – or unlucky – may be important. “Numbers matter more than you might think,” explained Terri Morrison, speaker and author of the Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands series of etiquette books. “In China, the word for ‘four’ sounds very similar to the word for ‘death’, so it is a good idea to avoid giving anything in fours.”

Similarly, in Japan, the traditional wedding gift of cash should not be given in bills divisible by two: that signifies the marriage could end in divorce. A gift of 20,000 yen, for example, should be given with one 10,000 yen and two 5,000 yen notes – but not two bills of 10,000 yen.

Hands off

Many Quora respondents from southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, reminded readers to be careful where they touch another person. “Never touch anyone’s head or pass anything from above the head,” said Neha Kariyaniya, a resident of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. “It is considered to be the most sacred body part.” Such touch is inappropriate even in informal situations – and also applies to small children, as tempting as rubbing their hair might be for visitors from other cultures.

“This is also very true in Thailand where the head is considered the seat of the soul,” said Morrison. The belief stems primarily from Buddhism, the religion that informs the everyday life of many Thai.

Keep to yourself

Quora users from across Western Europe pleaded for visitors to avoid striking up conversations with strangers. “Don’t talk to a stranger, except about how bad something is or about the weather,” said Londoner Thomas Goodwin. “Someone made eye contact with me on the Underground once,” joked fellow Londoner Paul Johnson. “Now they don’t have eyes.”

Other British users also commented on this one, saying that while talking to strangers is not always a negative, it should absolutely be avoided when using the Underground, London’s metro. “Avoiding eye contact is the only way to preserve your sense of personal space,” said Londoner Shefaly Yogendra.

In addition, the business-oriented nature of some of bigger cities in Northern and Western Europe often emphasises saving time – and avoiding unnecessary chatter. “Business means business in these countries, and any other topic of conversation is a distraction,” said Morrison.

Just go with it

When it comes to humour, people in some countries warned visitors to roll with the punches. Yucatan resident Alejandro Suarez said Mexico is a place where visitors should feel accepted – not offended – if they are being insulted. “We'll mock, ridicule, insult, pick on and put down just for the fun of it, on a regular basis!” Suarez said. “The best and most warm family dinners are the ones where everyone is laughing their heads off at making fun of someone at the table.”

This kind of humour is fairly common across Latin American cultures, Morrison said. Still, she warned visitors to tread lightly when returning the jabs. “Jokes just do not translate well,” she said. “It’s best to avoid them.” One man she interviewed for her books bombed a business meeting when he told a joke in an elevator in Germany. Instead of coming across as funny, he came across as not being serious in a formal situation.

Keep it down

Morrison said she was surprised that Quora users didn’t advise against speaking in elevated tones. “A loud tone of voice, particularly in a one-on-one conversation, can be tactless in many cultures,” she said. “In France, it’s truly gauche.”

She mentioned that the French use different volumes for different situations. “In a café, you cannot overhear a discussion at the nearest table, even if it is only two or three feet away,” she said. She recommended always mimicking your conversation partner’s volume and adjusting upwards only when needed.

Keeping your voice down isn’t just polite: it may even be safer. According to Morrison, in the 1990s, hidden microphones were discovered in Air France’s first class cabin. Though it was never determined whether the recordings were for espionage or another purpose, the incident was a reminder that, in today’s highly-monitored world, anyone could be listening at any time. “Conversations were, and may be [still], monitored by more than your travelling companions on flights, in hotels and in offices around the world,” said Morrison. A little discretion and self-awareness goes a long way when it comes to safety and privacy on the road.",What should I absolutely not do when visiting your country?,http://www.bbc.com,[Lindsey Galloway],http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/20/hm/p020hms0.jpg,2014-06-06 00:00:00,en,http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20140606-what-should-i-absolutely-not-do-when-visiting-your-country
433,"Love knows no borders – and no one knows that better than those who have found romance in another country. If you’re looking for a relationship, whether in your home country or abroad, you can up your odds in places known for their vibrant dating scenes.

These five cities, which we culled from lists by The Travel Channel, Travel and Leisure, and Conde Nast Traveler, include laid-back bars that make meeting people easy, trendy restaurants for that perfect first date, lush parks for romantic walks – and, most importantly, plenty of fun, friendly singles.

Buenos Aires, Argentina

Few places could be more romantic than the capital of Argentina and the birthplace of one of the world’s most sensual dances: the tango. “The nightlife lasts until 8 or even 10 in the morning,” said Catherine Huchan, an American who fell in love with an Argentine and moved to Buenos Aires five years ago. “Everyone [is] sweaty, dancing and so very happy.”

Buenos Aires is a city that embraces romance to its fullest. “Everyone from teenagers to viejitos [older people] sit on park benches and gaze into each other’s eyes, make out, kiss sweetly, you name it,” said Huchan, who is also communications director for Virtual Dating Assistants, a service that helps men build better online dating profiles. Outside of park benches, socialising often happens over a bottle of local red wine in a romantic bar or in a boliche (nightclub).

Most expats live in Palermo in Buenos Aires’ northeast. The largest neighbourhood in the city, Palermo has its fair share of restaurants and bars, along with the Buenos Aires Zoo and botanical gardens. For those who want to live in a more historic area, Neoclassical architecture and cobblestoned streets give the city’s oldest neighbourhood, San Telmo in Buenos Aires’ east, a romantic European vibe. For an upscale night out, head to Puerto Madero alongside the eastern Rio de le Plata riverbank. Known as the chicest part of town, Puerto Madero also has the city’s most stylish restaurants – including Cabana La Lilas, which serves its famous Argentinian beef with a view of the docks.

Austin, United States

The offbeat Texas capital has nightlife as diverse as its dating pool. “There’s a saying here: if you don’t like the scene, move on to the next bar until you do,” said Chandler Jones, a sales coordinator at the Austin Convention and Visitors Bureau. Many bars and restaurants have outdoor seating with long communal tables that make meeting others easy – and with 110 people moving to the city every day, according to Jones, there is no shortage of opportunity.

Even those moving to Austin from elsewhere in the US should expect a little culture shock, however. “Learning to say ‘yes, ma’am, and ‘yes, sir’ was very important to being a polite Texas citizen,” said Mary Gorham Malia, who moved to Austin from Portland, Maine, and runs the website Gay Girl Dating Coach to help lesbians in Austin and elsewhere hone their dating skills. Along with its reputation for southern charm, the city has a work-hard, play-hard mentality; residents tend to work in careers they are passionate about (music and technology are particularly vibrant industries) but still want to have a good time on weekends.

Singles should consider living in the neighbourhoods of Downtown, South Congress or Clarksville, where condominium living often includes a pool and barbeque area where people congregate, especially in the summer. These parts of town also offer easy access to the hottest dating spots, including popular restaurant Lambert’s Downtown Barbeque, which serves upscale versions of down-home plates (think wild boar ribs) and hosts regular live music in the 2nd Street District. Another romantic option is Lady Bird Lake in Downtown. “Kayaking on the lake in the middle of town can be a great way to enjoy a date,” said Gorham Malia. “You can paddle east towards downtown and watch millions of bats depart from under the [Congress Avenue] bridge at sunset.”

Copenhagen, Denmark

Founded as a Viking fishing village, Copenhagen has long summer nights (17 hours of daylight during the June summer solstice), giving romance extra time to bloom amid the city’s cobblestoned streets, wide beaches and plentiful parks and squares. Its the city’s residents, however, that breathe life into the nights all year long.

Locals are often known as the “Latinos of Scandinavia”, according to Copenhagen native Signe Thorup, thanks to their loudness, free-spirited nature and love of going out on the town. “Across Scandinavia, the Copenhageners are known to be laid-back party people,” she explained. “Always fun to be around.”

Romantic spots can be found throughout the compact city. But those looking for love should head to Vesterbro, just west of the city centre. Most of the city’s young people live in this neighbourhood, where trendy cafes and bars like Sticks ‘n’ Sushi and Mikkeller Bar keep the energy up all night long. In the morning, locals flock to Café Dyrehaven, a popular brunch spot known as much for its people-watching and sprawling patio as its eggs Benedict.

Montreal, Canada

With both a party atmosphere and a relaxed vibe, Montreal is an ideal place to date, say locals. “It’s a romantic’s dream,” said Nathan Munn, who moved to Montreal from Ottawa 12 years ago. “Charming neighbourhoods, a laidback atmosphere and many intimate bistros are perfect for a couple’s night out.”

Where you want to live depends on whom you want to date. “Each neighbourhood has its set of interest and values that appeal to people looking to meet certain people,” said Pamela Bakalian, who co-owns pastry shop Maison Christian Faure in Montreal’s Old Town.

Downtown Montreal, locals said, is best for urban party-seekers, with activity happening day and night along Crescent and Ste-Catherine streets. Hipsters and artists live in Le Plateau Mont-Royal north of downtown and east of Mont-Royal, the city’s namesake hill. The Village, east of downtown, is the largest gay neighbourhood by area in North America. Meanwhile, Old Town may be filled with tourists, but even locals love strolling the cobblestoned streets and eating at the many high-end restaurants. Restaurant Da Emma is one favourite for first dates, despite its quirky location in an old women’s prison: the Italian restaurant is known not only for its food but for its friendly owner, Rome-born Emma Risa, who regularly stops by to greet customers.

Cape Town, South Africa

With a rolling vineyards, sandstone mountains and plenty of beaches, South Africa’s second-largest city has no shortage of dating activities – and its relaxed, outgoing locals love to meet new people. “Capetonians are not shy to let their hair down and have a good time,” said Enver Duminy, CEO at Cape Town Tourism. “We’re quite social, and just grabbing a quick coffee while people-watching on Kloof Street or Long Street may lead to an interesting conversation.”

When the sun goes down, Camps Bay, a seaside suburb to the city’s southeast, comes alive. High-end restaurants and swanky clubs such as Café Caprice share the area with more casual hangouts like Dizzy’s Café, a local favourite with burgers, pizza and entertainment six nights a week, including karaoke, DJs and pub quizzes. Not just for nightlife, the area is also popular spot for expats to live, thanks to its safety and seaside location.

For those who want to be more centrally located, the Cape Quarter (called De Waterkant in Afrikaans), with buildings dating back to the 19th Century, is popular with artists and media folk. New restaurants, wine bars and gay clubs pop up here regularly, all within walking distance of one another. Looking for a quirky date spot?

448,"Britain's plan to issue the first Islamic bond from a Western government will strengthen its position as a centre for sukuk trade, but it may miss a chance to develop Europe's Islamic banking industry.

Last week, Britain mandated five banks to arrange a 200 million pound ($336 million) sukuk issue, part of Prime Minister David Cameron's effort to protect London against competition from other sukuk hubs such as Luxembourg, Dublin, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. The sukuk could be issued in coming weeks, subject to market conditions.

Britain's choice of HSBC (HSBA.L), Qatar's Barwa Bank, Malaysia's CIMB (CIMB.KL), National Bank of Abu Dhabi NBAD.AD and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) - big institutions with considerable marketing muscle - as arrangers appeared designed to ensure easy distribution and tight pricing.

But the choice was notable for excluding all of Britain's six full-fledged Islamic banks; none was included in the mandate.

That could reduce the impact of the issue in developing expertise and depth in Britain's Islamic banking sector, the largest in Europe. It may also limit British banks' access to the issue, making it harder from them to use the sukuk to manage their liquidity.

""The UK government's inaugural sukuk transaction is a good step forward as it will create a benchmark and open the market for other UK issuers,"" said Apostolos Bantis, emerging markets credit analyst at Commerzbank in London.

""However, this particular issue is unlikely to have any major impact right away. There needs to be more frequent issuance and also participation of private banks and corporates to establish a sukuk market out of the UK.""

British officials have previously indicated that the upcoming sukuk will probably be a one-off issue rather than the start of a regular issuance programme.

BANKS

One of the major Islamic banks in Britain is Bank of London and the Middle East BLME.DI, Europe's largest stand-alone Islamic bank, which is building stronger links with the Gulf - last year it opened an office in Dubai and listed its shares on a Dubai bourse.

In February, BLME was one of the co-lead managers of a $1.5 billion sukuk issue from the Islamic Development Bank [ISDBA.UL], the largest ever from the supranational lender.

""Naturally we are disappointed that no UK Islamic bank has been selected as an arranger as this would be a further opportunity to champion the UK Islamic finance market,"" said chief executive Humphrey Percy.

British Treasury officials did not respond to Reuters requests for comment; the government said earlier the arranging banks were selected in an open and competitive process.

The appointment as arrangers of Barwa Bank, CIMB and National Bank of Abu Dhabi - which are significantly larger than Britain's Islamic banks - suggests a big portion of the issue will go to cash-rich Islamic investors in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and southeast Asia, rather than Britain.

Islamic banks in Britain have lacked a wide range of highly rated, sharia-compliant, sterling-denominated instruments that can be used - and even traded - to manage their funds. Both BLME and European Islamic Investment Bank EIIB.L, another London-based institution, said they planned to buy the British sukuk on behalf of clients and for their own liquidity purposes.

This may be more difficult if much of the paper ends up parked in the Middle East and Asia, however.

""It would be possible to allocate half of this to British Islamic banks, although I suspect allocation will be mostly outside the UK,"" said Harris Irfan, EIIB's managing director.

""This will be primarily a buy-and-hold paper; given the relatively small size I cannot see it being highly traded.""

The sukuk's structure looks likely to limit the extent to which the issue could be expanded if demand proves heavy. Britain will use an ijara structure, a sharia-compliant sale and lease-back contract, under which the rental income of three central government offices will underpin the transaction.

Ijara means the size of the sukuk cannot be significantly greater than the intrinsic value of assets, 200 million pounds.

""It is unlikely, considering the comments we have seen from the Debt Management Office, that further assets could be included and a larger size issued,"" said another London-based Islamic banker, asking not to be named because of commercial sensitivities.

But for now at least, Britain seems to be asserting its dominance as a sukuk centre with its issue plan. ""We anticipate other governments like Luxembourg will start accelerating their own issuance plans, but for the time being the UK seems to have re-established its leading position,"" said Irfan at EIIB.

450,"HONG KONG Citigroup (C.N) will pay HK$5.425 billion (412 million pounds) for its new Hong Kong headquarters, in the largest ever purchase of a single-block office building in the Asian financial hub, the U.S. bank said on Tuesday.

A unit of developer Wheelock and Co Ltd (0020.HK) is building the twin One Bay East towers in Hong Kong's Kowloon district, with Citi taking the East Tower and insurer Manulife (International) Limited already the West.

The 21-storey building will become Citi's new hub for all its businesses in Hong Kong, where the U.S. bank said it employs almost 5,000 people, making it the biggest employer among foreign banks in the city.

Citi becomes the fourth major global bank to move its Hong Kong headquarters out of the city's increasingly expensive Central district, to the Kowloon area across the harbour.

Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX, Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have all moved from Central to the 118-floor International Commerce Centre in Kowloon in the last four years amid rising rents in Central.

Owning the building outright will help Citi protect itself against Hong Kong's notoriously volatile property market, Citi Hong Kong Chief Executive Weber Lo said in an internal memo to staff seen by Reuters.

""Our decision to purchase the East Tower of One Bay East underlines our belief and confidence in Hong Kong's continued growth as a leading global financial centre,"" said Stephen Bird, Citi's Chief Executive for Asia Pacific in a statement on Tuesday.

Hong Kong's government said on May 22 it had no intention of easing property cooling measures in the city, where prices have surged nearly 120 percent since 2008 due to an ultra-low interest rate environment, tight supply and abundant liquidity.

LONDON Oil companies lifted Britain's blue chip share index on Wednesday as heavy fighting in Iraq pushed crude prices towards $114 (67.25 pounds) a barrel.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BG Group BG.L rose 1.5 percent and 0.6 percent respectively, helping the UK oil and gas index .FTNMX0530 gain 1.4 percent to make it the top sectoral performer in the FTSE 100 .FTSE.

""The market is very closely watching the escalating violence in Iraq, a major oil producer. In the short term, higher oil prices may benefit some oil companies, but in the longer term, if it continues, it will result in an oil shock,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays.

""Clearly that would be an overall negative for the economy as higher oil prices have the potential to hurt global growth and raise companies' input costs.""

Brent crude oil rose towards $114 a barrel as Sunni militants hit Iraq's biggest refinery, stoking concerns about oil exports from OPEC's second-biggest producer as some firms pulled foreign workers out.

The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed up 0.2 percent, or 11.79 points, at 6,778.56 points. The index is only up 0.4 percent this year, but is just some 2 percent below its record high hit in late 1999.

Shire (SHP.L) topped the blue-chip leader board, rising 3.4 as bid speculation continued to swirl around the healthcare group. It had seen solid gains on Tuesday after sources told Reuters it had hired investment bank Citi (C.N) as an adviser, expecting to receive takeover approaches.

In the broader market, investors avoided heavy bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to cut another $10 billion from its monthly bond purchases, while investors will be watching for any comments on when the Fed would begin to raise interest rates and its outlook for the economy.

Data released on Tuesday showed a surprisingly high reading for U.S. inflation, which sparked speculation of a hawkish tilt to the Fed's policy outlook.

The FTSE was also held back by United Utilities (UU.L) and Severn Trent (SVT.L) as the two companies traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts.

Their shares fell by 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent respectively.

NEW YORK, June 18 Wall Street stocks jumped on Wednesday, taking the S&P 500 index of top companies to an all-time record after the Federal Reserve promised to keep in place low interest-rate policies and forecast the world's biggest economy would expand moderately.

Treasuries prices also gained, as the dollar added to mild losses posted ahead of a Fed policy statement and a news conference by U.S. central bank chief Janet Yellen, who calmed investor worries she might adopt a more hawkish tone on monetary policy.

""Steady as she goes, with respect to policy,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director at Action Economics in San Francisco. ""A lot of the doves want to make sure the recovery is for real and is in place and (are) still maintaining a very accommodative posture.""

Global markets worried that Yellen and the Fed might move more quickly than anticipated toward unwinding a low interest rate regime begun in 2008. But those worries appear to have dissipated.

The S&P 500 gained 14.99 points or 0.77 percent, to finish at 1,956.98, eclipsing the previous record set on June 9.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.13 points, or 0.58 percent, to end at 16,906.62. The Nasdaq Composite added 25.60 points or 0.59 percent, to 4,362.84 as U.S. equities extended a three-day winning streak

Among the biggest gainers was FedEx Corp, which rose 6.2 percent to $148.95 after hitting an all-time intraday high of $149.34. Its gains helped push the Dow Jones Transportation average up 1.5 percent.

Treasury debt traders had been especially worried Yellen might turn toward hawkish policies.

“There were a lot of people that thought there would be a lot more mention of inflation there, that there would have been a more hawkish tone, but on balance it came out fairly dovish,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.

Benchmark 10-year notes gained 17/32 in price to yield 2.59 percent. Five-year notes rose 11/32 in price to yield 1.67 percent.

In currency trading, the dollar retreated against the euro and the yen on the Fed's still-dovish tone, a cut in its forecast for economic growth and a hint long-term rates could be lower than previously indicated.

The dollar fell 0.22 percent against the yen at 101.93 yen, while the euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.3592. The dollar index reflecting the greenback against six other currencies dipped 0.3 percent to 80.387 .

The risk of a faster U.S. policy tightening was enough to keep European stocks from hitting new multi-year highs. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares slipped 0.02 percent at 1,387.44. A measure of world stock markets added 0.48 percent.

Brent crude oil rose 86 cents to a nine-month high at $114.31 as a strike by Sunni militants on a refinery near Baghdad stoked worries about oil exports. U.S. crude fell 39 cents to settle at $105.97 a barrel, the lowest since June 11.

NEW YORK The dollar slipped against most major currencies on Wednesday on expectations the Federal Reserve is not prepared to increase interest rates within the next 12 months despite signs domestic inflation is inching higher.

Sterling receded further from its five-year high against the greenback after the minutes from the Bank of England's policy meeting two weeks ago turned out less hawkish than expected.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, will conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday. It was widely expected to shave another $10 billion (5.90 billion pounds) from its monthly bond purchases to $35 billion, but unlikely to hint at any rate increases due to relatively high unemployment and inflation running below its 2 percent target.

""We are seeing a lot of caution ahead of the FOMC. We see some modest pressure on the dollar,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.

The dollar index that gauges the greenback against the euro, yen and four other currencies, dipped 0.14 percent at 80.508 .DXY, which was within the range established since hitting a four-month high earlier this month.

The dollar gave back Tuesday's gains linked to data that showed U.S. consumer prices rising 0.4 percent in May, its fastest monthly pace in more than a year. The bigger-than-expected increase in the consumer price index had raised bets this might spur Fed policy-makers sooner than what some traders had thought.

After the FOMC statement at 2 p.m. (1900 BST), traders will focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) where she is expected to hold down expectations of an imminent rate increases, which could hurt the dollar.

""She will stay fairly dovish,"" Harajli said.

A recent Reuters poll found a majority of Wall Street's top bond firms do not see the Fed raising rates before the second half of next year.

BOE SETS THE TABLE

Earlier the Bank of England released minutes on its June 4-5 meeting which showed members wanted to see more evidence of economic slack being absorbed before raising rates. That news weakened the pound against the dollar and the euro.

The tone of recent comments from policymakers, including those from Governor Mark Carney last Thursday, had bolstered expectations that one of the committee members may have voted for an increase earlier this month.

""Given the lack of hawkish surprises we could see some profit-taking on long sterling positions,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi in London.

BoE chief Mark Carney's warning last week that markets were too sanguine about the chances of a 2014 hike had earlier this week sent the pound soaring past $1.70 for the first time since mid-2009.

Sterling GBP=D4 last traded 0.12 percent lower at $1.6944, while the euro EURGBP=D4 gained 0.28 percent against the pound at 80.09 pence.

468,"LONDON Sterling fell on Tuesday from its recent peak above $1.70 (1 pound) after data showed British inflation dropped more than expected in May, tempering expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates later this year.

Sterling dropped to a day's low of $1.6938 GBP=D4 after a report showed UK inflation fell to a 4 1/2-year low, from around $1.6977 beforehand. It was also hurt by a stronger-than-expected increase in U.S. inflation, which pushed the dollar up in the afternoon session. Sterling was last trading at $1.6955, down 0.2 percent on the day. ECONUS

The pound rose past $1.70 for the first time in nearly five years on Monday as expectations grew that the BoE will tighten policy before the end of the year.

The euro gave up some of its earlier gains to trade flat at 79.90 pence, having risen to 80.09 pence EURGBP=D4 after the UK inflation data. The euro had hit a 20-month low of 79.59 on Monday as the gap between euro zone bond yields EU10YT=RR and British gilts GB10YT=RR widened the most since 1997, reflecting the diverging monetary policies of the European Central Bank and the BoE.

Governor Mark Carney surprised investors last Thursday by saying rates might rise before many were predicting, prompting investors to bring forward expectations for a first UK rate hike to before the end of this year from the first quarter of 2015. GBPOIS=ICAP

His deputy Charlie Bean added fuel to market speculation that the balance of opinion on the bank's policy committee may be shifting in favour of raising rates. A known dove, David Miles, has also said he expects to vote for a hike in interest rates before next May, The Times of London reported on Tuesday.

""The inflation data will go some way to abating the aggressive calls for a rate hike from the BoE this year, especially so following Carney's hawkish comments last week and other more recent comments from MPC members since,"" said Alex Edwards, head of corporate desk at UKForex.

""We could well see one or two votes for a rate hike at the last meeting when the MPC minutes are released tomorrow. The BOE governor may have been prepping the market for such a scenario, but this recent inflation data will put a small dent in expectations for a rate hike this year.""

Analysts said the tone of recent comments from policymakers had bolstered expectations that the minutes due on Wednesday would be hawkish.

""The pound remains below the $1.70 level and the minutes to the June meeting could well be the determining factor as to whether we see a break of the $1.7043 level reached in 2011,"" said Simon Smith, head of research at FxPro.

Sterling gained more than 10 percent in the past year on expectations a rapidly improving UK economy would prompt the BoE to raise rates before its peers in Europe and the United States. But the rally had stalled in the past month after Carney warned markets in mid-May not to expect swift action.

Also limiting a rise by the pound were expectations for macro-prudential measures to cooling the British housing market.

The BoE's Financial Policy Committee meets on Tuesday and the Financial Stability Report is due on June 26. Analysts say that a more targeted approach by the BoE's FPC to tamping down the housing market is likely to allow a more broad-based recovery to gain momentum and underpin the pound.

LONDON Britain and China signed deals worth more than 14 billion pounds on Tuesday during a visit by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, with energy and finance dominating the trade agenda.

In a trip aimed at deepening commercial ties between the world's second-largest economy and Europe's financial capital and moving past a row over Tibet, Li met Queen Elizabeth and held talks with Prime Minister David Cameron.

Cameron said the rise of China was ""one of the defining events of our century"" and that Britain wanted to strengthen ties on every level, from business to cultural understanding.

""Today we have signed deals worth more than 14 billion pounds, securing jobs and long-term economic growth for the British and Chinese people,"" Cameron told a news conference.

Li, on his first official trip to Britain since taking office, said the two countries had extensive shared interests.

""China is ready to work with the UK to foster a partnership for growth and inclusive development to ensure that this relationship will grow faster and in a healthier way,"" he said.

Oil major BP signed a 20-year deal worth around $20 billion to supply China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) with liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a conference in Moscow.

""It is a fair price for them and a fair price for us. It is a good bridge between the UK and China in terms of trade,"" Dudley said.

Shell also announced that it had signed an agreement with CNOOC strengthening its existing strategic ties.

OFFSHORE TRADING

The London Stock Exchange said it had signed agreements with two of China's biggest banks to develop offshore trading in the Chinese currency, the yuan (RMB).

London, which dominates the $5-trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market, is seeking to fend off challenges to its position as the leading yuan centre in Europe.

Li hailed a deal to make China Construction Bank (CCB), the country's second-largest lender, the first clearing service for offshore trading of the yuan in London.

""It will further consolidate and promote London's status as an international financial hub and will help the gradual internationalisation of the RMB to promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation,"" Li said at a speech to business delegates.

China views Britain, the world's sixth largest economy and home to the only financial capital to rival New York, as Europe's most open place to do business.

With Chinese firms keen to invest in major nuclear and high-speed rail projects, the two governments also agreed a framework to collaborate more closely on nuclear supply chain development and signed a memorandum of understanding paving the way for more cooperation on railway design and construction.

The state-owned China Development Bank Corporation (CDB), which finances government-led infrastructure projects and is looking to expand its overseas investments, signed a deal to build closer ties with TheCityUK, which represents Britain's financial industry.

Lloyds Banking Group also signed a memorandum of understanding with CDB to help secure inward investment from China, with a focus on energy and infrastructure.

PAST DIFFERENCES

China, whose $9 trillion (5.3 trillion pounds) economy is over three times the size of Britain's, wants to use the visit to move past differences with London over Tibet.

Britain's relations with China took a nosedive in 2012 after Cameron met the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who Beijing says is a separatist. Ties have recovered somewhat since, and Cameron visited China last year.

But tensions remain.

China has ruled Tibet since 1950, and Beijing warned London on the eve of Li's visit not to lecture it on the subject if it wanted good economic ties. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Monday that the people of China were politically shackled to a Communist one-party state.

Asked about Clegg's comments, Li said that China's constitution required human rights to be respected, and that the country was choosing its own path on the issue.

472,"LONDON Britain could become the first major economy to tighten monetary policy since the 2008 financial crisis, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has signalled, sending sterling shooting towards a five-year high against the dollar on Friday.

British government bond yields soared, construction stocks tumbled and interest rate futures priced in a first hike by December after Carney said rates could rise sooner than markets had thought - his most hawkish comment to date.

""There's already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike and this decision is becoming more balanced,"" Carney said in a speech late on Thursday alongside British finance minister George Osborne.

""It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.""

Few economists had expected rates to increase until the second quarter of next year given the central bank's previous guidance that there was plenty of scope for Britain's economy to expand further without causing inflation. POLL3

A Reuters poll of economists on Friday showed most expect a rate rise will come by March 2015, three months earlier than a previous poll published two weeks ago. Only a minority expect a rate rise before the end of this year.

A rise in BoE rates this year would be the first since 2007 and put it ahead of both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed is still pumping extra stimulus into the U.S. economy while the ECB cut interest rates to record lows last week and said it may not have finished easing.

Carney said Britain's economy still had room to grow without pushing up inflation, but added that he saw little sign yet of a slowdown in the pace of expansion that the central bank had pencilled in for the second half of the year.

""The change reflects the reality in the economy. It is flying now. Employment is rising at a record pace and we see no sign of economic growth slowing from its current pace,"" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg.

The pound hit a 5-1/2 year high against a trade-weighted basket of currencies =GBP and came with in a hair's breadth of its highest in almost five years against the dollar GBP=. Short sterling rate futures fell <0#FSS:>, pricing in the first hike by December. The interbank interest rate curve GBPOIS=ICAP (SONIA) also pointed to a rate rise by year's end. On Thursday it had pointed to a rise in the first quarter of 2015.

Rating's agency Standard & Poor's upgraded its outlook for Britain's triple-A credit rating to stable from negative late on Friday, although rivals Moody's and Fitch have still kept it a notch below triple-A.

An interest rate rise before a national election next May could hurt perceptions of the Conservative-led coalition government by raising mortgage costs and eating into disposable income, which the opposition Labour party says is being eroded by rising prices for everything from energy to transport.

""It is absolutely without question that those people who are right on the edge at the moment will, with a small increase in interest rates, be pushed over the edge,"" Conservative lawmaker Mark Garnier told Reuters.

HITTING VOTERS IN THE POCKET?

Although Britain's $2.5 trillion economy has won back the output lost in the convulsions of the 2008 crisis, Garnier said it could be a hard sell to convince voters of the recovery if they felt they had less money in their pockets.

""We can't just go to people and say: 'Yes, it's costing you more, but overall the economy is bigger'. They'll just turn around and say 'Well, it's not bigger for me',"" he said.

While Britain's economy is growing fast now, its recovery began much later than in the United States or Germany, and wages have fallen significantly in real terms since the financial crisis.

Carney also said the central bank would weigh carefully the merits of tackling housing market risks, including an undesirable loosening in mortgage underwriting standards, when its Financial Policy Committee meets later this month.

House prices in London have soared in the past year and though rises outside the capital have been more modest, Carney cautioned that average household debt was 140 percent of disposable income - higher than in most other countries.

Osborne said he would grant the BoE new powers to impose maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios on mortgage lending, a step which Carney welcomed.

Last month, a minority of BoE policymakers said the case for a rate rise was ""more balanced"" and that interest rates might need to increase sooner rather than later to ensure they did not need to rise sharply.

But Carney had until now appeared less keen to contemplate tightening, emphasising that Britain's economy was still a long way from full strength.

On Thursday, he said that more important than the timing of a first rate rise was that future increases be ""gradual and limited"", in part due to high household indebtedness and a drag on growth from a stronger currency.

He also said the timing of a rise would depend on incoming data, and the bank had no fixed plan on when to raise rates.

LONDON Bank of England policymakers were surprised earlier this month that markets had not priced in a higher chance of an interest rate rise this year, minutes of their June 4-5 policy meeting showed on Wednesday.

BoE Governor Mark Carney shocked markets last week by saying that a rise in interest rates could come sooner than markets had expected, prompting traders to bring forward bets on when rates would rise to December of this year from around March 2015.

Wednesday's minutes showed that Carney's view was shared more widely on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee. Members were concerned that markets had underestimated the chance of stronger-than-expected growth in the second half of 2014 eating up spare capacity in the economy.

""In that context, the relatively low probability attached to a Bank Rate increase this year implied by some financial market prices was somewhat surprising,"" the minutes said.

All members of the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold at a record-low 0.5 percent. But as last month, some MPC members said the case for a rate rise was becoming more balanced.

The MPC said it still expected that rate rises, when they came, would be gradual and to a level well below their pre-crisis average.

The BoE said that its staff maintained their forecast for 0.9 percent economic growth during the current quarter, and now saw upside risks to their forecast of 0.7 percent for the third quarter of 2014, due to strong survey data.

There were signs of a slowdown in housing market activity, but it was unclear if this was a temporary effect due to lenders getting accustomed to new mortgage rules, or if the rules and other factors were having a longer-term effect.

The MPC said that low interest rates created risks to financial stability from the housing market, but that these were best addressed by the BoE's Financial Policy Committee in the first instance.

The FPC is due to publish recommendations next week.

Some economists had speculated that at least one policymaker might have voted for a rate rise, after a sharp change in tone from BoE Governor Mark Carney last week.

But Britain does not face immediate inflation pressures, with the headline rate of consumer price inflation dropping to a 4-1/2 year low of 1.5 percent in May and wage growth even slower.

The MPC minutes said one explanation of the persistent weakness of wage growth could be that the economy has more slack in it than previously thought.

Most members of the MPC continued to think that the amount of slack was equivalent to 1-1.5 percent of economic output, but said this estimate was uncertain.

Carney has also previously noted that the economy faced headwinds from high indebtedness, a strong currency and weak export markets, and some analysts think markets have overestimated the chance of an early rate move.

476,"LONDON The Bank of England may be overestimating the amount of slack in Britain's labour market, pointing to a need for tighter monetary policy than it forecast in May, one of its policymakers said on Wednesday.

Martin Weale, an external member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, said the Bank could afford to tighten monetary policy slightly even if slack in the economy was greater than labour data currently suggest.

While acknowledging that wage growth was still unusually weak, monetary policy would still provide a great deal of support for the economy even after interest rates have started to rise gradually, said Weale in a speech in Belfast.

He said the measures of underemployment that contributed to the BoE's view of labour market slack in its inflation report in May in his view overstated the amount of spare capacity in the labour market.

Weale - known as one of the most hawkish members of the MPC - cited his own research that workers who were recently unemployed are less productive than average.

""If this is the case, then, as the economy continues to grow, unemployment could fall more quickly than the MPC expects. That on its own certainly points to a need for policy profile tighter than in our May forecast,"" he said.

Minutes from the MPC's June meeting on Wednesday showed policymakers were surprised that markets had not priced in a higher chance of an interest rate rise this year.

BoE Governor Mark Carney shocked markets last week by saying that a rise in interest rates could come sooner than markets had expected.

Weale underlined how balanced the case for tightening monetary policy was.

""I am sure we will all take note of the way that the (average earnings) data for April ... reinforced this sense of unusually low wage growth,"" he said.

In the three months through April, total pay including bonuses rose a yearly 0.7 percent, slowing from 1.9 percent in the three months to March. In the month of April alone, total pay fell by 1.7 percent compared with the same month last year.

478,"LONDON Housebuilder Berkeley has attacked government measures designed to help cool Britain's surging housing market, saying they were a poor policy response that would prevent house purchases by people who could afford them.

British house prices have risen by 11 percent over the last year, data showed earlier this month, benefiting house builders but leading to concerns that the property market could overheat and pose a risk to financial stability.

Finance minister George Osborne said last week he would give the Bank of England stronger powers to curb mortgage lending, by stopping Britons taking out loans that are too big compared with their income or the value of their home.

The comments sent shares in leading British housebuilders down more than 4 percent on the day.

""If you bring (in) these new rules, you stop people buying, you’re stopping people who can afford to buy, so personally I think the changes that the Bank of England proposed on mortgages are poor,"" Berkeley Managing Director Rob Perrins told Reuters on Wednesday.

""It’s a really bad thing. I think you should allow the mortgage market to work, the key thing is employment. People when they do buy a home and they are in employment, they will save to pay their interest payments,"" Perrins added.

The housebuilder, which said it had created 3,000 new jobs in the year ended April 30, has seen its profits jump in recent years thanks to strong demand for its London homes from overseas buyers.

It has been further helped by improved buyer sentiment stoked by government schemes to help Britons buy their first home.

Perrins's comments came after Berkeley posted a 40 percent rise in full-year pretax profit and said it was on track to deliver further growth in the long term.

GOOD DEMAND

Pretax profit rose to 380 million pounds from 270.7 million a year earlier, above the top end of the range of analyst forecasts between 309 and 379 million, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of 13 banks and brokerages.

""We have had very good demand ... People now feel like the economy is beginning to pick up and they are getting real wage growth, so they feel much more confidence to come and buy,"" said Perrins.

Berkeley said it invested 353 million in nine new sites for the year ended April 30, which was sufficient to build 2,500 homes. It also said it had a ""pipeline"" of 11,000 plots of land, which would be worth 1.5 billion pounds over the next five years.

Shares in Berkeley fell 3.7 percent to 2,178 pence by 1019 GMT, making it one of the biggest losers in the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies. The stock fell as low as 2,166p, equaling a seven-month low set last month.

""Berkeley’s numbers are bang in line with expectations, perhaps a tad ahead,"" said analyst Stephen Rawlinson at brokerage Whitman Howard.

""Telling everyone that the housebuilders are in a good moment is not that helpful really, as share prices are being driven by sentiment and a view about whether the good performance will continue,"" Rawlinson added.

480,"LONDON The proportion of British households expecting the Bank of England to hike interest rates in the next six months doubled in June, according to a survey that also showed the squeeze on their finances easing slightly.

Financial data company Markit said some 60 percent of British households now expect the central bank to raise rates from a record low 0.5 percent before the end of the year, compared with 30 percent in May's report.

The survey of 1,500 households was conducted from June 11 to June 16, straddling a major speech last Thursday from BoE Governor Mark Carney who said interest rates could rise sooner than financial markets expected.

The findings were part of Markit's monthly Household Finance Index, which rose in June to 42.5 from 42.3 in May, not far off April's record high of 43.0. The index measures households' perception of their overall well-being.

Dating back to early 2009, it has risen sharply in recent months but a reading below 50 still represents households feeling worse off.

Markit also noted that expectations for the next 12 months hit a five-month low.

""The fall in households' financial expectations coincides with greater prospects of an interest rate hike before the end of 2014,"" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit.

""Policymakers will be keeping a close eye on households' reaction to the possibility of more expensive mortgages, given the need to ensure that consumer demand is not choked off by further shifts towards policy tightening.""

A poll commissioned by the Bank of England, released earlier this month but conducted in May, showed that 42 percent of Britons expected a rate rise over the next 12 months - the highest proportion since May 2011.

Economists think British interest rates will start rising in the first quarter of 2015, according to a Reuters poll conducted on Friday, one day after Carney's speech.

482,"LONDON The Bank of England is most likely to try and cool Britain's booming housing market by using one of the more radical options in its toolbox, a cap on how large mortgages can be compared to a borrower's income, a Reuters poll found.

House prices have surged 11 percent over the past year, raising concerns among policymakers that it could be overheating.

This prompted British finance minister George Osborne last week to give the BoE's Financial Policy Committee stronger powers to curb mortgage lending, enabling it to compel lenders to act rather than to just make recommendations to the sector.

While economists polled in the past week were united in saying the FPC would act to reduce the risks that the housing market poses to financial stability when it meets on Tuesday, they were less sure about what moves it would make.

The moves will be announced on June 26 alongside the FPC's half-yearly financial stability report.

The likeliest option among economists polled by Reuters was for the BoE to recommend that lenders limit how much they lend as a ratio of a borrower's income. This could be politically sensitive in the run-up to a national election in May 2015 because it may make it harder for first time-buyers to get on the property ladder.

Until recently, the FPC had been expected to take measures which affect home-buyers less directly, for example, by requiring banks to hold more capital against home loans.

""They could look at loan-to-income ratios and either ask banks to increase the capital that they hold against new lending which is at a high loan-to-income ratio or put forward a recommendation that banks restrict the lending they do,"" Allan Monks, JP Morgan's UK economist.

A loan-to-income cap was seen by 14 of the 29 economists polled.

Smaller numbers said the BoE would make lenders hold more capital against certain types of mortgages, limit how many higher risk loans a bank could issue, or ask the government to cut the 600,000 pound ($1 million) ceiling on its Help to Buy scheme which aids buyers unable to pay large deposits.

Since April, mortgage lenders have been required to make stricter checks on a borrower's ability to repay, which has slowed the process of giving loans and which lenders prefer to relatively crude loan-to-income caps. A further option for the FPC would be to make those checks tougher.

With predicted gains of 8 percent this year and a still robust 5 percent in 2015, all of the economists in the poll who answered an extra question said the Bank would act. [GB/HOMES]

Governor Mark Carney cautioned last week that average household debt was 140 percent of disposable income - higher than in most other countries.

With the average asking price for a home at 272,275 pounds in June according to property website Rightmove - around 10 times the typical British salary - that ratio is unlikely to come down anytime soon.

Data from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed that UK house prices rose 9.9 percent year on year in April, marking the biggest rise since June 2010.

THE RATE DEBATE

BoE Governor Mark Carney said last week Britain's economy still had room to grow without pushing up inflation, but added he saw little sign yet of a slowdown in the pace of expansion that the central bank had pencilled in for the second half of the year.

Tuesday's poll suggested the economy, after expanding 0.8 percent in the current quarter, would then grow 0.6-0.7 percent per quarter, little-changed from a May poll. It indicated that inflation would reach the Bank's 2.0 percent target early next year - just when economists expect policy to be tightened.

The Bank of England is reluctant to raise interest rates too fast - or too soon - in case it chokes off the recovery, and a Reuters poll on Friday found interest rates will start rising in the first quarter of 2015.

That poll was taken the day after Carney said rates may rise sooner than markets expect and gave an earlier consensus than a May 28 poll which predicted the first hike would come in the second quarter of next year.

Such a move would make Britain the first major economy to tighten policy since the 2008 financial crisis.

Last year the BoE said monetary policy would remain unchanged until unemployment fell to 7 percent, something it thought would take around three years to reach.

But that guidance was abandoned after just six months as unemployment sank and the Bank said it would instead focus on a wide range of measures, including how much spare capacity the economy had.

It reckons there is around 1-1.5 percent slack, and just over half of the economists polled in the past week agreed with that, despite it being something very hard to measure.

""Arguing about the true underlying measure of spare capacity is a bit like arguing about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.

""However ... the degree of spare capacity must be slightly smaller than when the BoE first gave its estimate in February.""

484,"LONDON British inflation slumped to a 4 1/2-year low last month but house prices surged in April, according to data that clouded the view for Bank of England policymakers gauging Britain's economic recovery.

Consumer price inflation dropped to 1.5 percent in May from 1.8 percent in April, its lowest since October 2009, after the first year-on-year fall in food prices since 2006, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.

That undershot all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, who had expected a decline to 1.7 percent.

But separate data from the ONS showed house prices soared 9.9 percent in April, their biggest annual rise since June 2010, heightening concern that a bubble may be developing in the property market.

""The divergent data will further complicate the discussion about the appropriate timing of the first increase in interest rates from their current record low,"" said Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit.

The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee meets on Tuesday and is widely expected to take steps to curb the risks to financial stability from rapidly rising house prices and high levels of debt.

Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after the data. Government bond futures reversed losses in early trade.

While Britain's economy has been growing at a rapid pace, low inflation has allowed the BoE to keep interest rates at their record low 0.5 percent.

But that could change before the end of the year. BoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that rates might rise sooner than markets had previously expected, though for now Britain's economy still had room to grow without pushing up inflation.

David Miles, who sits on the Monetary Policy Committee with Carney, said in an interview published on Tuesday that interest rates have a strong chance of rising before next May. Minutes from the MPC's June meeting will be released on Wednesday.

""Although we doubt that there will have been votes for higher rates, we expect tomorrow's minutes will echo some of what Miles had to say yesterday, and make the Carney speech appear more representative of the committee as a whole,"" said Malcolm Barr, economist at J.P. Morgan.

FOOD AND FARES

The ONS said inflation in May was subdued by the first year-on-year drop in food prices since 2006, as well as lower clothing prices and cheaper air and ferry fares. Food prices fell by 0.6 percent on the year, which the ONS said may have been caused by a price war between major supermarkets.

But while prices are falling for some household essentials, the central bank is likely to be concerned about rapidly rising house prices, which in London rose 18.7 percent on the year. Excluding London and the south east, house prices were 6.3 percent higher.

Finance minister George Osborne said on Thursday that he would grant the Bank of England new powers to impose maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios on mortgage lending - a step that the BoE's Carney welcomed.

Data released alongside the CPI by the ONS on Tuesday showed that factory-gate inflation in May rose by 0.5 percent on the year, slowing from 0.6 percent in April.

488,"LONDON British interest rates have a strong chance of rising before next May, a member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee told a newspaper, reinforcing the view that the central bank may still tighten monetary policy this year.

BoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that interest rates might rise earlier than the market had been expecting. That led market participants to bring forward expectations of a rate hike to 2014 from early next year.

David Miles, the most persistent advocate for more stimulus in 2012 and 2013, told the Times that consistently strong growth might have influenced the change in tone.

""I guess until very recently the expectation implied by the short end of the yield curve (was) that the first rise in interest rates might be April or May next year. Clearly there is the chance that the rise will be before that,"" Miles said.

""Consistently, growth has come in stronger. The longer that lasts, clearly one starts to change one's view of how robust the recovery is and that will affect when you think is the right time to start normalising policy.""

Miles said the chance of a rate rise before the end of the year was above the 10 percent probability which markets had previously priced in, which he described as ""implausibly low"".

Britain's economy kept up last year's strong pace of growth in the first three months of this year, and a record number of people found work in the three months to April.

But subdued inflation has enabled the BoE to keep rates at a record low. Figures on Tuesday showed that annual inflation dropped to 1.5 percent in May, its lowest since October 2009.

Miles said he had no desire to keep up his record of never voting for a change in interest rates - which some in the market took to mean that he was more open to voting for a rate hike.

Minutes from the latest monetary policy meeting are due on Wednesday and investors will scour them to see if more policymakers voted for rate hikes.

The latest change in the Bank's tone comes after its forward guidance had to be adjusted earlier this year because of a surprisingly fast fall in unemployment.

Forward guidance was adopted to manage market expectations without needing to provide more stimulus. The original guidance stipulated that the Bank would not consider raising rates until unemployment fell below 7 percent.

Asked about its credibility in light of those changes - and whether people would pay attention to the BoE's remaining message that any rise in rates will be gradual and limited - Miles defended the policy.

""That first stage of forward guidance served its purpose in heading (off) a risk of a rapid tightening in the stance of policy in the embryonic stage of a recovery. We've gone beyond that now, so it makes sense the message has to change,"" Miles said.

""The committee can agree that the most likely outcome at the moment is that, when the rate increases come, they are probably going to (be) gradual,"" he said. ""There is no point in saying definitely because stuff happens that you can’t expect — they will be gradual and to a level that is lower than what we used to think of as normal.""

The forecast, by Oxford Economics for London promotional organisation London & Partners, said growth would be helped by proposed changes to immigration law that will give technology firms the right to bring in migrants on ""exceptional talent"" visas.

492,"LONDON Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean said he was optimistic about Britain's economy and would welcome being able to raise interest rates from record low levels, as it would show the economy was getting back to normal after the financial crisis.

Bean - who retires at the end of the month - said in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper published late on Saturday that it would be unhealthy to keep rates low for too long.

“I would welcome us getting on to the path of normalisation, as a demonstration that the economy is healing. Frankly, having interest rates at an emergency level for a very long time is not a situation one wants to be in,” he said.

BoE Governor Mark Carney surprised markets on Thursday when he said interest rates could increase sooner than they expected. Most economists now expect rates to rise by March next year, and a significant minority think a rate hike could come before the end of this year.

Bean reiterated the BoE's view that rate rises would be gradual when they came, and was upbeat about the economic outlook for Britain.

“I am optimistic. This is a recovery that has legs. We are starting to see better balance, with investment picking up. Manufacturers we talk to are pretty positive. There are still risks but there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful,” he said.

On Tuesday, Bean and other members of the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) will consider whether to take more steps to tackle risks posed by the housing market. House prices have risen by more than 10 percent over the past year, but Bean said the situation was not out of control.

“I see what the FPC could do as insurance against problems that might build, rather than that we have already let the genie out of the bottle,"" he said.

494,"WASHINGTON Lockheed Martin Corp got good news on Tuesday when Raytheon Co failed to protest the award of a $915 million contract to Lockheed in time to block automatically the company's work on a new ground-based radar.

Raytheon has missed the federal deadline to file a protest with the Government Accountability Office that would have triggered an automatic stop-work order on the contract, according to sources familiar with federal law and the timing of an Air Force briefing on the contract.

The U.S. Air Force awarded the space-tracking Space Fence contract to Lockheed on June 2. Raytheon and Lockheed both declined comment.

Ralph White, GAO's managing associate general counsel for procurement law, said the congressional agency had not received a protest about the contract from Raytheon as of late Tuesday.

Air Force spokesman Major Eric Badger said Raytheon was briefed about the contract award on June 9 but had no additional comment.

The Air Force chose Lockheed to develop a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other space junk. Including options the deal is estimated to be worth just under $2 billion.

Under federal law, contractors seeking to halt work on a contested program must file a protest within 10 days of the contract award, or five days after a mandatory briefing by the awarding agency.

Raytheon still has until Thursday to protest the contract award, 10 days after its Air Force briefing, but that would not necessarily halt work on the program. Companies generally file within the earlier timeframe, the sources said.

The company could also file a claim with the agency directly or with the Court of Federal Claims.

Raytheon won a separate contract on June 2 to build the terminals for highly-secure military satellites that enable the U.S. president to communicate during a nuclear war, a contract once held by Boeing Co.

Boeing spokesman Richard Esposito on Tuesday said his company had decided not to protest the decision following a debrief by the Air Force.

WASHINGTON The hot question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold blooded like reptiles, fish and amphibians finally has a good answer.

Dinosaurs, for eons Earth's dominant land animals until being wiped out by an asteroid 65 million years ago, were in fact somewhere in between.

Scientists said on Thursday they evaluated the metabolism of numerous dinosaurs using a formula based on their body mass as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones and their growth rates as shown by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees.

The study, published in the journal Science, assessed 21 species of dinosaurs including super predators Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, long-necked Apatosaurus, duckbilled Tenontosaurus and bird-like Troodon as well as a range of mammals, birds, bony fish, sharks, lizards, snakes and crocodiles.

""Our results showed that dinosaurs had growth and metabolic rates that were actually not characteristic of warm-blooded or even cold-blooded organisms. They did not act like mammals or birds nor did they act like reptiles or fish,"" said University of Arizona evolutionary biologist and ecologist Brian Enquist.

""Instead, they had growth rates and metabolisms intermediate to warm-blooded and cold-blooded organisms of today. In short, they had physiologies that are not common in today's world.""

There has been a long-standing debate about whether dinosaurs were slow, lumbering cold-blooded animals - as scientists first proposed in the 19th century - or had a uniquely advanced, more warm-blooded physiology.

As scientists unearthed remains of more and more fast-looking dinosaurs like Velociraptor, some championed the idea dinosaurs were as active and warm–blooded as mammals and birds. The realization that birds arose from small feathered dinosaurs seemed to support that view.

University of New Mexico biologist John Grady said the idea that creatures must be either warm-blooded or cold-blooded is too simplistic when looking over the vast expanse of time. Like dinosaurs, some animals alive today like the great white shark, leatherback sea turtle and tuna do not fit easily into either category, Grady added.

""A better answer would be 'in the middle.' By examining animal growth and rates of energy use, we were able to reconstruct a metabolic continuum, and place dinosaurs along that continuum. Somewhat surprisingly, dinosaurs fell right in the middle,"" Grady said.

The researchers called creatures with this medium-powered metabolism mesotherms, as contrasted to ectotherms (cold–blooded animals with low metabolic rates that do not produce much heat and bask in the sun to warm up) and endotherms (warm–blooded animals that use heat from metabolic reactions to maintain a high, stable body temperature).

Grady said an intermediate metabolism may have allowed dinosaurs to get much bigger than any mammal ever could. Warm–blooded animals need to eat a lot so they are frequently hunting or munching on plants. ""It is doubtful that a lion the size of T. rex could eat enough to survive,"" Grady said.

498,"SANTIAGO The arrival of the 66th and final giant antenna at the world's largest land-based space observatory in the Chilean desert will allow the endeavor to better probe the mysteries of the universe, the project's director said on Tuesday.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array's (ALMA) antennae are situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau, a remote area of the Atacama desert in northern Chile at 16,400 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. There, the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky.

With all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope, the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the ""cold universe"" where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered, said project director Pierre Cox. He added that ALMA is poised to reach its full potential next year.

""Up to now ALMA's observations and data were published with 16 to 20 antennae, now we're going to have double that or more, hence there will be a jump in sensitivity: better, quicker and more data,"" Cox said. ""I think there will be a real stream of scientific results in the coming months and years.""

The new 12-meter (13-yard) diameter dish is the 25th European antenna to be transported up to the observatory. It will work alongside 25 other antennae from North America and four from East Asia, as well as 12 smaller 7-meter (7.7-yard) dishes from East Asia.

The $1.1 billion telescope, which began full-scale operation in March, has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the center of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. It also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star.

ALMA is funded by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Japan.

WASHINGTON If you want to find Earth's vast reservoirs of water, you may have to look beyond the obvious places like the oceans and polar ice caps.

Scientists on Friday said massive amounts of water appear to exist deep beneath the planet's surface, trapped in a rocky layer of the mantle at depths between 250 miles and 410 miles (410 km to 660 km).

But do not expect to quench your thirst down there. The water is not liquid - or any other familiar form like ice or vapor. It is locked inside the molecular structure of minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite in mantle rock that possesses the remarkable ability to absorb water like a sponge.

""It may equal or perhaps be larger than the amount of water in the oceans,"" Northwestern University geophysicist Steve Jacobsen said in a telephone interview. ""It alters our thoughts about the composition of the Earth.""

""It's no longer liquid water that we're talking about at these great depths. The weight of hundreds of kilometers of rock and very high temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 Fahrenheit) break down water into its components. And it's not accessible. It's not a resource in any way,"" Jacobsen added.

Jacobsen said water is taken down into the mantle with minerals during the process known as plate tectonics - the slow, inexorable movement of the colossal rock slabs that make up the Earth's surface.

When the minerals containing this water reach certain depths, they break down in a process called dehydration and release the water to form magmas. Such ""dehydration melting"" is common in the shallow mantle and forms the source for magmas in many volcanoes.

In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers present evidence that this is also occurring much deeper in the mantle in a region called the ""transition zone"" between Earth's upper and lower mantle.

The study combined lab experiments involving synthetic ringwoodite being exposed to conditions simulating the heat and pressure of the ""transition zone"" and observations of events in this zone based on seismic data from a network of more than 2,000 seismometers across the United States.

A team led by Jacobsen and University of New Mexico seismologist Brandon Schmandt identified deep pockets of magma, a likely signature of the presence of water at those depths.

""Melting of rock at this depth is remarkable because most melting in the mantle occurs much shallower, in the upper 50 miles (80 km),"" Schmandt said in a statement. ""If there is a substantial amount of H2O in the transition zone, then some melting should take place in areas where there is flow into the lower mantle, and that is consistent with what we found.""

The research built on another study in March showing that a commercially worthless diamond found in Brazil contained ringwoodite that entrapped water amounting to more than 1 percent of its weight. Ringwoodite has been found in meteorites, but this was the first terrestrial sample because it normally is so deeply buried.

502,"ALBUQUERQUE N.M. A fossil mastodon skull found by a group attending a bachelor party at a New Mexico lakeshore is more than 10 million years old and will take at least six months to clean, a museum paleontologist said on Friday.

The partygoers stumbled across the skull this week, complete with its tusks, buried in sand at Elephant Butte State Park, about 155 miles (250 km) south of Albuquerque.

Gary Morgan, curator and head paleontologist at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, led a team that spent some six hours on Thursday carefully excavating the fossil, which was buried in about four feet (1.2 meters) of lake silt.

When it emerged, it was found to measure approximately five feet by three feet (1.5 by 1 meters) and weighed more than 1,000 pounds (450 kg).

""This mastodon find is older than the woolly mammoth that tread the Earth in the Ice Age. ... It probably died on a sandbar of the ancient Rio Grande River,"" Morgan told Reuters.

""I've been here for 20 years and have never seen something like this before.""

Mastodons were relatives of the elephant that stood 10 feet (3 meters) tall and migrated to North America some 15 million years ago. They ranged across the continent with saber tooth tigers, giant sloths and American camels before becoming extinct about 10,000 years ago.

Morgan said the unusual discovery came to light after some water was drained from the Elephant Butte Lake two weeks ago to provide irrigation for parts of southern New Mexico and Texas.

He said the meticulous process of cleaning the fossil would now likely take his team some six months before they could then begin examining it more closely.

The museum will put the fossil on public display, he said, but probably not for a year while those studies take place.

""This is too important to keep stored in the back,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Eucalyptus leaves are the main food supply for Australia's koalas, but there is a lot more to the tree than that.

It is native to Australia but has become the world's most widely planted hardwood tree. The eucalyptus tree is a source of timber, fuel, cellulose and medicinal and industrial oils, and scientists are looking to maximize its potential in biofuels.

An international team of researchers this week unveiled the genetic blueprint of the tree species Eucalyptus grandis and identified among its 36,000-plus genes the ones involved in critical biological processes controlling tree growth and wood formation, flowering and other qualities.

""The main interest is understanding how these trees grow so fast and how they are able to produce such large amounts of cellulose,"" scientist Zander Myburg of the University of Pretoria's Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute said in a telephone interview on Thursday.

""There's an interest in cellulose in the context of breaking the cellulose down into sugars, which can be fermented into biofuels. But really these trees are widely used industrially for cellulose-related products and timber, pulp and paper production.""

Also called gum trees, eucalyptus trees have grown for tens of millions of years across the Australian landscape, and are closely identified with that continent. The koala, one of Australia's characteristic marsupials, munches its leaves. Its wood also is used in making the Australian aboriginal wind instruments called didgeridoos.

Eucalyptus trees, with their speedy growth rate and exceptional wood and fiber properties, are now grown in about 100 countries on six continents.

Some scientists see great potential in these trees as a biomass energy crop. The study identified genes controlling the final steps for the production of cellulose and ""hemi-cellulose"", both carbohydrates that can be used for biofuel production.

""We have a keen interest in how wood is formed,"" added Gerald Tuskan of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, another of the lead researchers.

""A major determinant of industrial processing efficiency lies in the composition and cross-linking of biopolymers in the thick secondary cell walls of woody fibers. Our analysis provides a much more comprehensive understanding of the genetic control of carbon allocation towards cell wall biopolymers in woody plants - a crucial step toward the development of future biomass crops,"" Tuskan said in a statement.

The study was published in the journal Nature.

WASHINGTON This is certainly not just another fish tale.

A tiny jawless fish that lived more than half a billion years ago is providing scientists with a treasure trove of information about the very dawn of vertebrate life on Earth.

Researchers on Wednesday described about 100 fossil specimens of the fish unearthed at the Burgess Shale site in the Canadian Rockies and other locales, many exquisitely preserved showing the primitive body structures that would later evolve into jaws.

The fish, Metaspriggina, lived about 515 to 500 million years ago amid the astonishing flourishing of complex life during the Cambrian Period. While two fragmentary specimens had been found previously, the new ones revealed unprecedented detail about one of the earliest known vertebrates.

Creatures like Metaspriggina began the lineage of vertebrates - animals with backbones - that later would include the whole range of jawed fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals including people.

""It allows an understanding of where we come from and what our most distant relatives might have looked like,"" said Jean-Bernard Caron, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. ""Because of its great age - more than half a billion year old - Metaspriggina provides a deep down view at the origins of the vertebrates.""

Metaspriggina was a soft-bodied jawless fish no bigger than a person's thumb - about 2-1/2 inches (6 cm) long, with a small head, a narrow, tapering body, a pair of large eyes atop the head and a pair of small nasal sacs.

It did not have bones but possessed a skull possibly made of cartilage as well as precursors to vertebrae and a skeletal rod called a ""notochord"" that provided body support like backbones would do in later vertebrates. It is unclear if it had fins.

The scientists were especially excited about the gill structure of the fish because of the preview it gives to the anatomy of later vertebrates - paving the way for the jaws that would open a world of possibilities for so many later creatures.

Metaspriggina boasted seven pairs of rod-like structures called gill arches, or branchial arches, that functioned for both filtration of food particles and respiration. The first pair of these gill arches was more robust than the others and presaged the first step in the evolution of jaws, Caron said.

Scientists have known about the importance of these arches in the evolution of vertebrates but had never before been able to see such an early example.

""Metaspriggina is important because it both fills an important gap in our understanding of the early evolution of the group to which we belong, but in particular shows with remarkable clarity the arrangement of the so-called branchial arches,"" University of Cambridge paleontologist Simon Conway Morris said.

Part of the jaw bones eventually evolved into tiny middle ear bones in mammals, Caron added, noting that the evolution of these arches ""had a profound impact on how vertebrates look, live and function today.""

The study was published in the journal Nature.

WASHINGTON Current theory about the shape of the human face just got a big punch in the mouth.

Two University of Utah researchers proposed on Monday that the face of the ancestors of modern humans evolved millions of years ago in a way that would limit injuries from punches during fist fights between males.

Their theory, published in the journal Biological Reviews, is presented as an alternative to a long-standing notion that changes in the shape of the face were driven more by diet - the need for a jaw that could chew hard-to-crush foods such as nuts.

""Studies of injuries resulting from fights show that when modern humans fight, the face is the primary target,"" biologist David Carrier said. ""The bones of the face that suffer the highest rates of fracture from fights are the bones that show the greatest increase in robusticity during the evolution of early bipedal apes, the australopiths.""

These are also the bones that show the greatest difference between women and men in early human ancestors and modern humans, Carrier added.

In both apes and humans, males are much more violent than females, and most male violence is directed at other males, Carrier said. The violence underpinning the need for a more robust facial structure may have involved fist fights over females, resources and other disputes.

Australopithecus was a lineage that preceded our genus, Homo, and it emerged more than 4 million years ago in Africa. Australopithecus was bipedal, smaller than modern people and possessed a combination of ape and human characteristics.

""Comparing great apes such as chimps and gorillas to australopiths, what changed in the face was a reduction in the length of the jaws, a great increase in the robustness and strength of the jaws, molar teeth and jaw muscles, a substantial increase in the size and strength of the cheek bones, and an increase in the part of the face that surrounds the eyes,"" Carrier said.

The proportions of the hand that allowed for the formation of a fist and the great increases in the robustness of the face occurred early in our lineage, 4 million to 5 million years ago, at about the same time as the bipedal posture appeared, Carrier added.

Carrier said anthropologists have thought the new facial traits in the first bipedal apes were the result of a diet that included very hard objects, and the biomechanics of eating such food can explain many of these features. But he said recent analyses of wear patterns in teeth suggest most of these creatures did not eat hard objects.

The study by Carrier and Michael Morgan, a University of Utah physician, builds on their previous research highlighting the role they contend violence played in driving human evolution.

TOKYO Japan's annual exports declined for the first time in 15 months in May as shipments to Asia and the United States fell, threatening to knock the economy hard at a time when domestic consumption is being crimped by a national sales tax increase.

The data backs expectations for additional stimulus from the Bank of Japan in coming months, particularly if market confidence takes a hit as external demand proves elusive.

""If exports fail to pick up while domestic demand stagnates, that would heighten calls for the BOJ to act,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

Total exports fell 2.7 percent May on the year, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, compared with a 1.2 percent drop seen by economists and a 5.1 percent rise in April. On a seasonally adjusted basis, exports fell 1.2 percent in May from the prior month.

The central bank is counting on exports growth to partially offset the impact of a sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent in April, but the MOF data will be a worry for policy makers.

Adding to the BOJ's concerns over soft exports to Asia is the surprising weakness in shipments to the United States - Japan's biggest export market - which suggests a recovery in advanced economies is slow to filter through to exporting firms.

This was underscored in Singapore's exports for May, which unexpectedly fell on weak shipments to its key markets. The city-state's non-oil domestic exports to the United States fell 8.8 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with 11.7 percent growth in April.

In South Korea, exports to the U.S. rose 5.5 percent on-year, but that was much slower than April's 19.3 percent jump.

The MOF data showed Japan's U.S.-bound exports fell 2.8 percent, the first drop in 17 months led by decline in car shipments, while exports to China rose 0.4 percent on-year.

Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's total exports, fell 3.4 percent in May from a year earlier, the first annual decline in 15 months.

MISPLACED CONFIDENCE?

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week said the timing of export recovery may have been delayed, but the bank has maintained that the economy is on track to meet its 2 percent inflation goal next year, shrugging off the need for additional stimulus. [ID:nL4N0OU0JD]

Minutes of the May 20-21 BOJ meeting released on Wednesday reinforced policymakers' confidence about the economic outlook.

The central bank chief sees shipments eventually picking up as overseas markets, mainly advanced economies, recover.

However, the latest data suggests external demand may not fire up nearly enough to help Japan's economy cope with short term dips in growth.

Norinchukin Research's Minami believes that although market expectations for fresh BOJ easing steps have largely been pushed back to later this year, Kuroda may act by autumn to arrest a loss of momentum.

The world's third-biggest economy picked up speed in the first quarter as consumers loaded up on goods ahead of the tax hike, but growth is expected to slump in the current quarter as the effects of the one-off consumption spike winds back.

""In today’s world of very low US$-value export growth Abenomics could only count on export-led growth by taking market share,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients.

""It remains to be seen whether Abenomics can stimulate domestic spending sufficiently to offset weak export demand.""

DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION, EXPORT VOLUMES WEAK

Indeed, the negative impact of the sales tax hike on consumption was highlighted in Japan's imports for May, which fell 3.6 percent on the year, versus a 1.7 percent increase expected.

The weaker imports helped the country's trade deficit narrow from a year earlier to 909.0 billion yen, but still marked a record run of 23 months in the red.

Japan's exports had grown at a double-digit pace in the second half of last year, but growth has slowed to below 10 percent this year as the effects of a weak yen fade.

More worryingly, the yen's fall has failed to shore up export volumes, which peaked in 2007 and have been falling for a third straight year in 2013.

Export volumes fell 3.4 percent in May from a year ago, highlighting the plight of exporters as a weak yen has boosted import costs more than export income.

BOJ's aggressive monetary stimulus helped weaken the yen by some 20 percent last year, boosting exporters' profits and share prices. However, the yen has moved sideways this year versus the dollar, limiting gains in the value of exports.

SHANGHAI China's central bank is planning to create a new monetary tool that will help adjust supply to the country's monetary base and consequently help guide medium-term interest rates, the semi-official China Business News said on Wednesday without citing sources.

The new tool is a type of supplementary lending instrument backed by collateral. Temporarily called ""Pledged Supplementary Lending"" (PSL), the tool is similar to the central bank's existing re-lending monetary tool, the newspaper said.

""The central bank wants to use the interest rates on the PSL to create medium-term (benchmark) interest rates,"" the newspaper said. These would be interest rates of three months to a year.

The People's Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

PSLs, if deployed as China Business News described, would supplement the central bank's existing set of targeted tools for managing interest rates and liquidity, helping its ongoing campaign to rely more on precision firepower in its money markets to ensure capital is routed to productive uses, as opposed to opening the capital floodgate by reducing system-wide bank reserve requirement ratios (RRR) or reducing benchmark long-term interest rates.

Such major policy moves risk provoking destabilizing inflation cycles, industrial over-capacity and speculative asset price bubbles.

The PBOC is able to manage short-term rates in the interbank market because it can easily test demand using bond repurchase agreements (repos), which have tenors ranging from one day to 91 days. It has also deployed short-term lending facilities (SLFs) and other supplementary mechanisms, but at present its ability to test commercial bank demand for longer-term capital is more limited.

At the same time, PSLs could also serve a policy purpose, helping guide rates for lending to investment projects that are guaranteed by the government, such as infrastructure and other socially beneficial uses.

JERUSALEM U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Iran's economy remained in a state of distress due to sanctions over its nuclear programme and that the United States would not rush into making a bad deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

Lew said that the temporary and reversible sanctions relief have been limited.

""Iran is losing a significant amount in oil sales alone from the sanctions that remain in place, more than the value of the temporary relief,"" Lew said in a speech in Jerusalem to the U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group on Wednesday.

""As we approach the last month of the agreed upon period for negotiations, Iran's economy remains in a state of distress that brought the government to the negotiating table in the first place,"" he said.

Such sustained pressure gives the United States the opportunity to pursue a negotiated agreement with Iran, in conjunction with its P5+1 partners, that will assure the international community that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful, Lew said.

""We will take the time to do this right, and we will not rush into a bad deal,"" he said. ""No deal is better than a bad deal.""

Iran and six world powers re-launched talks on Tuesday to try to salvage a deal on its nuclear activity by a July deadline, striving to prevent a long-time standoff from descending into a wider Middle East war.

Israel has been concerned that the powers have not done enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

Israel also has voiced concern about the prospect of its closest ally, the United States, cooperating with what it considers its deadliest foe, Iran, to stave off a sectarian break-up of Iraq.

Lew said the United States was concerned about the ""grave situation"" in Iraq.

""As the president (Barack Obama) makes a decision on next steps, let me be clear that this is not primarily a military challenge,"" he said, noting the United States has steadily increased security assistance to the Iraqi government over the past year. ""While it is evident that Iraq needs significantly more help to break the momentum of extremist groups and bolster the capabilities of Iraqi security forces, there is no military solution that will solve Iraq's problems.

Any action the United States takes would have to be done in conjunction with a serious and sincere effort by Iraqi leaders to govern in a non-sectarian manner, promote stability and unity among a diverse population, build and invest in the capacity of security forces, and address the legitimate grievances of Sunni, Kurd, and Shia communities, Lew said.

Lew also expressed optimism about the U.S. economic recovery, which is in its fifth year.

""After a harsh winter that restrained growth in the first quarter, we are still expecting the underlying strength of the economy that was evident last year to result in a strong second half of this year, and economic data over the past three months supports that optimism,"" he said.

BEIJING China's average home prices fell for the first time in two years in May and price weakness spread to more major cities, adding to signs of cooling in the property market which are posing a growing risk to the broader economy.

The 0.2 percent monthly price drop in May, though slight, follows data last week that showed growth in property investment slowed while property sales and new construction tumbled, compounding the challenges for leaders in Beijing as they deal with an economic growth slowdown.

The real estate sector, which accounts for more than 15 percent of China's economic output and directly impacts around 40 other business sectors, could determine the severity of that downturn.

""If the cooling-off in real estate continues, the authorities will need to make more effort to manage the slowdown in the broad economy,"" said Lv Fengyong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a government think-tank in Beijing.

Analysts said large inventories of unsold homes and recent sluggish sales are likely to trigger wider and deeper price cuts in coming months, as developers act to maintain cash flow. However, they said evidence of a sharp correction in home prices remains thin, putting to rest for now at least fears of a hard landing in the wider economy.

""The high inventories in some cities and developers' recent promotions, together with unclear market expectations that kept buyers staying on the sidelines, led the prices to fall,"" Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said in a statement accompanying the data on Wednesday.

New home prices fell in May from April in 35 of the 70 cities polled, up from eight cities in April. (For table with more price data, see)

Versus a year ago, new home prices rose 5.6 percent in May, easing from the previous month's 6.7 percent rise and the slowest annual rise in 13 months.

The worst year-on-year performance was in the eastern city of Wenzhou, where prices fell 4.4 percent in May.

A recent private survey showing China's vacancy rates were around 22 percent suggest a considerable overhang of inventory, which could undermine property as an investment class and add momentum to price declines. With its stock markets in a prolonged slump, property has been one of the few investments in China to offer attractive returns.

Moody's Investors Service last month cut its outlook for China's property industry to negative from stable, noting expectations of a slowdown in sales growth and a large supply overhang in the market.

""The risk of a more persistent and sharper downturn in the property sector is now the biggest risk facing China’s economy in 2014 and 2015,"" Wang Tao, an economist at UBS Bank, said in a note.

HOW LONG WILL WEAKNESS LAST?

After a strong performance in 2013, China's real estate market has softened. Sales have slowed and banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to developers and home-buyers.

Month-on-month falls were seen in some major cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, which saw home prices drop 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent respectively, the NBS data showed.

Existing-home prices also dropped month-on-month in 35 cities in May, compared with 22 in April.

Analysts said a moderate adjustment in the property market will be welcomed by the government, which has spent more than four years trying to tame record housing prices amid fears of an asset bubble.

But any signs of a more serious slowdown in the property market could indicate more policy support may be needed to head off risks to the banking sector and balance the world's second-largest economy.

""We are not concerned about the likelihood of housing price collapse in China as the current turn is just a rational market adjustment,"" said He Qi, deputy secretary-general of China Real Estate Association.

""Housing demand remains solid in China as most Chinese still view property as one of the best investment options.""

Property shares slipped after the price data, with the Shanghai property sub-index down 0.5 percent.

Recent policy tweaks at local level and government efforts to speed up lending may help the market from sliding further.

Many Chinese local governments, which badly need proceeds from land sales to pay maturing debts, have eased home-buying restrictions and made it easier in recent months for buyers to borrow from local housing provident funds.

BUENOS AIRES Argentina's battle with investors who rejected its proposals to restructure debt risks pushing the nation into a new default that would wreck its attempts to return to credit markets but not have the same economic effect as its catastrophic 2001-02 default.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear Argentina's appeal against lower court rulings that ordered it to pay in full the hedge funds which refused 2005 and 2010 debt swaps on $100 billion in debt.

As the risk of default rises, Argentina must now either negotiate a deal with the funds it dismisses as ""vultures"" or quickly find a way around the court rulings that would prevent it from paying holders of its restructured debt if it doesn't also agree to pay the holdouts.

Argentina's battle with investors who rejected its proposals to restructure debt risks pushing the nation into a new default that would wreck its attempts to return to credit markets but not have the same economic effect as its catastrophic 2001-02 default.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear Argentina's appeal against lower court rulings that ordered it to pay in full the hedge funds which refused 2005 and 2010 debt swaps on $100 billion in debt it issued in 2001.

As the risk of default rises, Argentina must now either negotiate a deal with the funds it dismisses as ""vultures"" or quickly find a way around the court rulings that would prevent it from paying holders of its restructured debt if it doesn't also agree to pay the holdouts.

Economy minister Axel Kicillof announced Tuesday the government is taking first steps to swap restructured debt to place it under Argentine law and make payments in Argentina. He also said he sent Argentine lawyers to talk to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Griesa in New York about his ruling, as it's pushing the country into a default, even when Griesa said he doesn't want to do that.

Still, a new default won't likely bring on the same economic devastation the 2001-02 default did, policymakers and economists said.

""The economic situation was different,"" said Jorge Todesca, the deputy economy minister in 2002, noting that the economy had shrunk 10 percent over three years, the country had a trade deficit and ""commodity prices were half of what they are now.""

The state and banks were heavily indebted and industry had been battered by a decade of the peso pegged to the dollar.

At the end of 2001, thousands of Argentines lined up at banks to withdraw their savings, sensing the whole system was on the verge of bankruptcy. The country defaulted at the end of 2001, the currency crashed and the economy shrank 10.9 percent in 2002.

Now, while the economy is set to decline this year and inflation is high, the country has been growing at an average of 6.2 percent a year for a decade.

Banks are solid, with low capital ratios, and Argentina still boasts a trade surplus, albeit a shrinking one, thanks in large part to high prices for soy. It is the world's third biggest soybean and corn exporter, at a time of booming international food demand.

""This is not going to be a default because of a lack of capacity for payment, this will be a technical default because of the courts,"" said analyst Mauro Roca of Goldman Sachs.

SABOTAGE

Roca and other economists said a possible default might exacerbate the expected decline this year but not cause a meltdown.

Corporate and public credit would become even more expensive, uncertainty might put a further brake on already cautious consumption and investment, and the peso would come under more pressure.

Commodity exports would unlikely to be affected much, economists said.

Lack of access to capital markets wouldn’t be anything new: the country has been cut off from global capital markets for more than a decade. Foreign debt is lean, amounting to 8 percent of GDP in dollar terms, Kicillof said today.

A new default would, however, destroy Argentina's recent push to get back into international credit markets in view of its dwindling foreign reserves, which slid 30 percent last year.

Over recent months, the country has reached deals with Spain's Repsol and the Paris Club of creditor nations to regain international investors' trust, a strategy that helped lift stocks and bonds.

""This has come at completely the wrong time,"" said Neil Shearing at London-based Capital Economics, noting the driver of Argentina's economic weakness was strains with the balance of payments forcing the government to implement capital controls and devaluation.

""Had they been able to regain market access, they could have brought to an end this crisis in balance payments.""

With little prospect of accessing markets any time soon and declining dollar reserves, the government might further tighten capital controls and import restrictions, former head of the central bank Aldo Pignanelli said.

Shearing said that access to capital markets and a few tweaks in policy like a tightening of fiscal spending could restore the economy to a situation of strength, unlike in 2001 when it needed a major overhaul.

""That's the infuriating point, Argentina is near and yet so far,"" he said.

TOKYO Japan's exports suffered their first annual decline in 15 months in May as external demand remained soft despite a recovery in advance economies, suggesting a bumpy ride for the world's third-largest economy.

Exports to Asia and the United States fell during the month, Ministry of Finance data released on Wednesday showed, which is likely to heighten concerns about Japan's growth outlook at a time when consumption is being crimped by a national sales tax increase.

Exports fell 2.7 percent in the year to May, the MOF data showed, compared with a 1.2 percent drop seen by economists and a 5.1 percent rise in April. On a seasonally adjusted basis, exports fell 1.2 percent in May from the prior month.

The data will be a worry for Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda who last week said the timing of export recovery may have been delayed.

The BOJ is counting on exports growth to partially offset the impact of a sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent in April, and sees shipments eventually picking up as overseas economies, mainly advanced economies, recover.

However, the recent signs suggest that external demand is slow to pick up.

""The mechanism where exports drive activity in the manufacturing sector is not working, so this cannot offset the impact from the sales tax hike,"" said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.

""The U.S. economy is improving, so Japan's exports will eventually recover, but it will take more time.""

Exports to the United States decreased 2.8 percent, while shipments to China rose 0.4 percent in the year to May.

Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's total exports, fell 3.4 percent in May from a year earlier.

The MOF data indicates weakness in external demand is more perverse in the region than some had thought.

Singapore's exports unexpectedly fell in May on weak shipments of electronics and pharmaceuticals to its key markets, data showed on Tuesday, indicating the city-state may not be benefiting yet from a recovery in developed economies.

Japan's economy picked up speed in the first quarter as consumers loaded up on goods ahead of the tax hike, but growth is expected to slump in the current quarter as the effects of the one-off consumption spike winds back. An extended period of weak shipments could hit the economy hard, which analysts say could prompt the BOJ into additional easing measures.

Japan's imports fell 3.6 percent in the year to May, versus a 1.7 percent increase expected, bringing its trade balance to a deficit of 909.0 billion yen ($8.91 billion), the MOF data showed.

That compared with an expected shortfall of 1.17 trillion yen, and marked a record run of 23 months in the red.

YEN IMPACT FADES

Japan's exports had grown at double-digit pace in the second half of last year, but growth has slowed to below 10 percent this year as the effects of a weak yen fade.

Export volumes also fell 3.4 percent in May from a year ago, highlighting the plight of exporters as a weak yen has boosted import costs more than export income, the data showed.

BOJ's aggressive monetary stimulus helped weaken the yen by some 20 percent last year, boosting exporters' profits and share prices. However, the yen has moved sideways this year versus the dollar, limiting gains in the value of exports.

The central bank kept monetary policy steady last week and offered a more upbeat view on overseas growth, signaling confidence the economy is on course to meet its inflation target next year without additional stimulus.

NEW YORK Traders are bracing for more volatility in markets as fighting in Iraq intensifies, with the recent rise in crude oil prices posing risks to the strong rally in U.S. stocks.

Investors worry that the insurgent Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which threatens to take control of northern Iraq, could extend its reach to the south and cripple oil production in OPEC's second-largest exporter. This week, fighting shut the country's biggest oil refinery.

Concern over Iraq was in part responsible for the S&P 500's .SPX largest weekly drop in two months last week, when prices for Brent crude LCOc1 jumped the most since last July.

""The spike in energy prices is a problem, since it isn’t coming on rising demand, just concerns about supply,"" said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA Investments in San Antonio. ""High energy prices are sand in the gears of economic activity.""

Prolonged fighting would boost volatility in stocks and in particular hit transportation, shipping and airline companies with a significant portion of their expenses from fuel costs.

Oil production in the north of Iraq has been down since March, but the prospect of supply disruptions in the oil-rich south has pushed the price of Brent crude to a nine-month high in recent days.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note that $125 per barrel for Brent - near the highs hit in 2011 and 2012 - is on their watch list. Others have said the Brent peak near $150 in mid-2008 could be in play.

In that case, expect more weakness in transports and airlines. During last week's 4 percent rise in oil prices, the S&P 500 fell 0.68 percent. But the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT slid 2 percent and the NYSE ARCA airline index .XAL lost 4.9 percent. The 10-day correlation between the XAL and Brent is at -0.86, the strongest inverse relation since September.

The price of U.S. wholesale gasoline RBc1 also jumped last week, up 4 percent, and brushed against its highest since July. Analysts fear that a steady climb could hit consumer spending.

""We already have the evidence in that the recovery is slow,"" said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. He said for every $1 a gallon of gasoline rises, about $150 billion in spending power is taken out of the hands of low- and middle-income American households.

""The most likely thing to happen is this schism is not going to be resolved in a peaceful way,"" he said. ""We have a growing war with growing intensity.""

The market has already taken note. Consumer discretionary stocks on the S&P 500 .SPLRCD fell 1.7 percent last week and the retail index .SPXRT fell 2.3 percent, the most for both since April. Wal-Mart (WMT.N) lost 2.5 percent, while Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) fell 2.2 percent in its first weekly drop in four.

Investors will likely continue to pile into energy shares. The S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY, which was down on Tuesday, is up 9.6 percent so far this year. The sharp move has pushed the energy sector into overbought territory, measured using an index of relative strength, leaving it vulnerable if the Iraq situation is resolved.

Oil volatility spiked last week, with the CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index .OVX up more than 30 percent to its highest level since late April.

Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, the market's favored indicator of anxiety, may for a time become a proxy for investors' concerns about the Middle East. Investors are slowly starting to pay a bit more for insurance against violent market moves - though at this point such hedges are still cheap.

The VIX recently traded at its lowest since 2007, but it rose 13.5 percent last week. At 12.2 it is still far below its historical average of 20 and the average in the last year of 14.3.

""My guess is over the next few weeks and months the VIX will tightly follow oil prices. If oil continues to rise, I think you're going to see a more pronounced spike in the VIX,"" said Russ Koesterlich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock in San Francisco.

544,"TOKYO Bank of Japan policymakers shared the view that supply constraints such as labor shortages had surfaced as a massive monetary stimulus increased demand, minutes of the central bank's May meeting showed on Wednesday.

""Many members expressed the view that it was important to make efforts to raise the growth potential of the economy from a medium- to long-term perspective,"" the minutes of the May 20-21 meeting showed.

At the May meeting, the BOJ kept policy steady and painted a slightly more optimistic view of the economy, revising up its assessment on capital spending and dropping a reference to the country being in deflation.

The central bank stood pat on policy at a subsequent meeting in June, when it offered a more upbeat view on overseas growth, further dashing expectations of near-term monetary loosening.

598,"* Further $10 billion trim to monthly bond buying on tap

* Quarterly rate hike projections to be scrutinized

* Decision due at 2 p.m. EDT/1800 GMT; Yellen news briefing follows

By Howard Schneider

WASHINGTON, June 18 The Federal Reserve's policy committee concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday with little change expected in its outlook for interest rates but the potential for new details to emerge on the planned exit from its current easy monetary policy.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to decide on a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly bond buying, staying on course to shutter the program entirely by year end.

It will announce its decision and release fresh economic and interest rate projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a news conference to discuss the results a half hour later.

The interest rate ""dots"" plotting the views of each policymaker will be watched closely for any shift in the expected timing or pace of rate increases, and for whether officials lower their view of the long-run target interest rate in response to a diminished sense of the economy's potential.

The Fed cut overnight rates to near zero in December 2008 as it battled the financial crisis and deep recession.

Investors in futures markets predict it will finally lift them in June 2015, while the consensus of economists in a Reuters poll released on Tuesday expected the Fed to begin raising rates in the third quarter of next year.

The meeting will include a few new faces around the table: Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and Fed Governor Lael Brainard. Brainard, however, was sworn in too late to submit economic and interest rate projections.

While the Fed's policy statement is still expected to call for rates to remain near zero ""for a considerable time,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said she expected the individual forecasts to begin to diverge.

Many economists have cut their growth forecasts for the year due to a dismal first quarter that was largely the product of severe winter weather but also reflected a slower than expected expansion of housing and business investment, and the Fed is expected to follow suit.

Though growth is expected to accelerate in 2015, Swonk said there are doubts the recovery is robust enough for the Fed to feel confident about a rate increase.

""It is a sense of two steps forward, one step back,"" said Swonk as she presented a mid-year forecast of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association on Tuesday. The Fed ""is going to stay the course, but I think you are going to see more uncertainty"" in the economic outlook and more dispersion among officials about when rates should rise.

One central issue facing the Fed as it contemplates a move away from its crisis-era monetary policy is whether and for how long to keep its bloated balance sheet from shrinking by reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities it holds. The Fed has more than quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.3 trillion through a series of large-scale bond purchases.

If any decisions are taken, Yellen could make an announcement at her news conference.

June 18 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlooks on Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd (Eskom) and Transnet SOC Ltd (Transnet) to Negative from Stable and affirmed their Long-term local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR). A full list of rating actions is below.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The rating actions follow the revision of the Outlook on South Africa's Long-term IDRs to Negative from Stable (see 'Fitch Revises South Africa's Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'BBB'; dated 13 June 2014 at www.fitchratings.com).

Eskom ratings remain linked to those of the South African sovereign, based on Fitch's assessment of its legal, operational and strategic ties with the state as strong in accordance with the agency's 'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage' criteria.

Transnet's 'BBB' IDRs reflect our view of its stand-alone profile as 'BBB-'. The single-notch uplift to 'BBB' reflects the strong strategic and operational links between Transnet and its parent, the sovereign. The Outlook on the foreign currency IDR is now constrained to Negative by the sovereign rating Outlook as we do not typically rate state owned corporates above the sovereign rating.

The rating actions are as follows:

Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd

Long-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook revised to Negative from Stable

Senior unsecured local currency rating: affirmed at 'BBB+'

National Long-term rating affirmed at 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable

National Short-term rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)'

Please see 'Fitch Affirms Eskom at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable' dated 2 August 2013 at www.fitchratings.com for Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities.

Transnet SOC Ltd

Long-term foreign currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook revised to Negative from Stable

Foreign currency senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'BBB'

Short-term foreign currency IDR: affirmed at 'F3'

Long-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable

Local currency senior unsecured rating: affirmed at 'BBB'

Short-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'F3'

National Long-term rating affirmed at 'AA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable

National Short-term rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)'

National senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'AA(zaf)'

National senior unsecured rating for notes guaranteed by South African government upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)'. This action reflects a recalibration of the higher end of the South African National Rating scale.

PARIS General Electric's (GE.N) chief executive will on Thursday unveil to the French government and unions an improved offer for the energy arm of Alstom, a source close to the U.S. conglomerate said of its efforts to fend off a rival proposal.

Alstom's board is due to announce by Monday its choice between GE's 12.4-billion-euro ($16.8 billion) cash offer and a competing proposal by Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T).

The fight for the power business of the 86-year-old French company has turned into one of Europe's fiercest industrial tug-of-wars for years, drawing in a French Socialist government which has given itself powers to veto any deal in the name of protecting local jobs and influence over a key sector.

""GE is seeing the government and the Alstom unions tomorrow,"" the source close to GE said on Wednesday. ""The offer will, of course, be improved.""

A separate source close to the matter confirmed the meeting and added that Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg was set to meet GE management around midday on Thursday, before meeting with Alstom unions in the afternoon.

Almost immediately after Siemens and MHI presented their rival plan on Tuesday, President Francois Hollande's government told both sides to come up with better offers.

Siemens says its proposal with MHI values Alstom's power arm at 14.2 billion euros - nearly two billion euros more than GE's.

But the two offers are very different in nature. Whereas the former involves Siemens buying just the gas turbines arm of Alstom and MHI taking minority stakes in its other power activities, the GE offer is for all Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses and accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.

An ad hoc committee of independent board directors, led by former chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) Jean-Martin Folz, is due to give a recommendation on the merits of the two proposals to the Alstom board, likely on Friday, according to a source close to Alstom.

ALLIANCES

Both GE and Siemens-MHI have stressed their commitments to keeping and creating jobs in France to win political favour.

GE has said a deal with Alstom would create 1,000 French jobs within three years but the government is eager for it to formalise the pledge on paper. GE is also expected to address concerns over French access to strategic assets such as power equipment used in nuclear plants, wind and hydro turbines, as well as the fate of Alstom's remaining rail arm.

GE has been discussing those parts of the deal with the government over the past weeks.

GE's Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told French lawmakers last month his group would set up global headquarters for the grid, hydro, offshore wind and steam turbines businesses in France. Immelt also said GE was considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business. [ID:nL6N0OD5DA]

The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that GE was now considering selling the unit to Alstom.

Montebourg has said he would not let Alstom be ""devoured"" and is worried that the group, an innovator and big private employer in the country, would be weakened if reduced to its rail arm, which accounts for a quarter of group revenue.

A source familiar with the matter said the government was looking for GE to offer more balanced ""alliances"".

""Alliances can take various forms... It can be capital alliances, industrial tie-ups, it can be joint-ventures, shareholdings,"" the source said.

The same source said the government would make its view known at least to Alstom before its decisive board meeting.

BOUYGUES QUESTION MARK

After a meeting with Montebourg on Tuesday, some Alstom unions welcomed the Siemens-MHI plan, saying that it would better preserve Alstom.

But several sources close to Alstom told Reuters they were concerned about the relative complexity of the Siemens-MHI plan and that, unlike the GE offer, they did not consider it as having binding status.

Those sources familiar with Alstom's thinking are sceptical that the Siemens-MHI plan can address Alstom's core problems: its lack of critical mass in a tough power market and the need to inject cash into its more promising transport arm.

An all-cash purchase by GE of the power arm could return an exceptional dividend to Alstom shareholders and allow the company to refocus on its transport arm known for making France's iconic TGV bullet trains.

Ratings agency Moody's said in a note that the Siemens/MHI offer had the potential to strengthen Alstom financially and bring its debt down.

""It would however also leave Alstom in control of structurally declining (coal power generation) or competitive and oversupplied (power grid) businesses, whose further development could prove challenging,"" Moody's said.

Further question marks remain over the intentions of 29-percent shareholder Bouygues. The group has publicly stated it would support any decision made by Alstom's board and wanted to keep its shareholding at 29 percent in the long term.

However one source familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said it wanted a significant stake in a group which it believes has a future - with a stake of over 20 percent that enables it to consolidate related earnings - but would not want a diluted stake in a business it sees as wobbly. A spokesman for Bouygues said on Wednesday morning that MHI had offered to take a stake of up to 10 percent in Alstom by buying up some of its stake along with French public investment bank BPI. However he said Bouygues had not been approached by the state or BPI at this stage.

NEW YORK U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 ending at a record after the Federal Reserve hinted at a slightly faster pace of interest-rate increases starting next year but suggested rates in the long run would be lower than it had indicated previously.

The benchmark S&P 500 set intraday and closing record highs while the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX or the VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest since February 2007.

""It's onwards and upwards for equities, especially after the Fed's announcements today,"" said Mike Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' intermediary business in Boston.

""There is an improved labor environment and inflation that is still below what the Fed considers a normal level,"" Arone said. ""I think that environment shapes up very well for risk assets and equities in particular.""

After a two-day policy meeting, the U.S. central bank slashed its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to a range of between 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent from an earlier projection of around 2.9 percent. But the Fed's forecasts for 2015 and 2016 were unchanged, and it expressed confidence that the recovery was on track.

""Economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace,"" Fed Chair Janet Yellen told a news conference. ""The economy is continuing to make progress towards our objectives"" of full employment and 2 percent inflation.

As widely expected, the Fed pushed ahead with plans to wind down one of its main stimulus programs, reducing its monthly bond purchases to $35 billion from $45 billion.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 98.13 points or 0.58 percent, to end at 16,906.62. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 14.99 points or 0.77 percent, to 1,956.98, a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.60 points or 0.59 percent, to 4,362.84.

Wednesday's advance pushed the S&P 500 above its previous record closing high of 1,951.27, which was set on June 9.

The S&P 500 index has gained 1.1 percent for the week as investors largely shrugged off mounting tensions in Iraq and focused on a flurry of merger and acquisition activity as well as on better-than-anticipated manufacturing data.

The VIX slid 12 percent to close at 10.61, its lowest in more than seven years. Part of the drop was because of options contract expirations on Friday.

Among the biggest gainers was FedEx Corp FDX.N, which rose 6.2 percent to $148.95 after hitting an all-time intraday high of $149.34. The world's No. 2 package delivery company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. The stock's gain helped push the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT up 1.5 percent.

Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shares jumped 2.7 percent to $334.38 after Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos unveiled a ""Fire"" smartphone with free, unlimited photo storage, jumping into a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc AAPL.O and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.

Adobe Systems ADBE.O shares shot up 8.2 percent to $73.08. Adobe was the S&P 500's best performer a day after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.

One of the wallflowers at Wall Street's party, however, was ConAgra Foods CAG.N, whose stock slid 7.3 percent to $30.47 after the maker of Hunt's tomato ketchup and Slim Jim beef jerky warned about fourth-quarter results.

Volume was around 5.94 billion shares on U.S. exchanges, above last month's average of about 5.76 billion, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

FedEx Corp (FDX.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as strong shipments of items ordered online boosted the ground business of world's No. 2 parcel delivery company.

FedEx said results in 2015 would also benefit from the restructuring of its express business, its largest by revenue, and it forecast full-year earnings that were better than many analysts and investors had expected.

The company's shares rose as much as 5.4 percent to a life high of $147.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

""Forward earnings estimates across the Street (had) declined, as many were somewhat cautious on the quarter...,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note to clients.

The company, like larger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), has been cutting costs to offset rising fuel prices.

The Memphis-based company is also restructuring its Express business, which has suffered as clients choose slower but cheaper delivery options, by revamping its routes and cutting capacity to Asia and other international markets.

""Ground and Freight are performing well and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan despite the fuel headwinds we've experienced,"" Chief Executive Fred Smith said on a post-earnings call.

Revenue from FedEx's ground business, which accounts for a quarter of the company's total revenue, rose 8 percent to $3.01 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31.

U.S. online retail sales are expected to increase to about $300 billion in 2014 from $260 billion last year, according to John Yozzo, managing director of FTI Consulting Inc's (FTI.N) Corporate Finance/Restructuring business.

SIZE MATTERS

FedEx said last month it would start charging for all ground shipments by parcel size, in addition to weight, to reduce costs.

UPS followed suit with a similar announcement on Tuesday in the face of rising oil prices amid concerns that escalating violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies.

The new pricing will allow the logistics giants to charge more for items that are bulky, but not necessarily heavy, such as diapers and large soft toys.

That will add to shipping costs for online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O).

FedEx forecast 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. Analysts expect $8.75, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

If FedEx meets the high end of its forecast, it would beat or be in line with the expectations of 22 out of the 29 analysts covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Total revenue in the quarter rose 3.5 percent to $11.8 billion. Analysts had expected $11.66 billion.

The company reported earnings of $2.46 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.36 per share.

FedEx said capital expenditure would rise about 2 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015. The increase is largely due to aircraft deliveries to support the company's fleet modernization program and for expansion of its ground network.

FedEx shares were up 4.9 percent at $147.19 in early afternoon trading. UPS's shares little changed at $102.32.

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday accused General Motors Co (GM.N) of a ""disturbing pattern"" of neglecting safety and revealed emails from 2005 in which a GM employee warned a ""big recall"" may be necessary over an ignition-switch problem that was only addressed this week.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra faced tough questions about widespread safety failures at GM in her third public appearance before Congress since the automaker started recalling millions of vehicles in February.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker has issued 44 recalls this year, including one for an ignition flaw linked to at least 13 deaths over the past decade. It has recalled 20 million vehicles, mostly in the United States, of which nearly 6.5 million were recalled for ignition switch-related issues.

In the emails made public on Wednesday, GM employee Laura Andres in 2005 sent one to engineers warning that a 2006 Chevy Impala Special car she was driving had experienced an engine stall when moving between a paved road and gravel.

She said a technician had advised the problem may be with part of the ignition switch.

""I think this is a serious safety problem, especially if this switch is on multiple programs. I'm thinking big recall,"" Andres said in an email sent to 11 other GM employees including the vice president of North American engineering.

Andres declined to comment on Wednesday.

The 2006 Impala was not recalled until Monday of this week, as part of an additional 3 million cars that GM recalled for an ignition-switch issue.

GM in February and March recalled 2.6 million cars, including the Chevrolet Cobalt, for a separate ignition switch issue in which the car could unexpectedly stall, disabling air bags, power steering and power brakes.

A GM investigation found the automaker had ignored warnings about the deadly defect for more than a decade.

""This latest recall appears to follow the same disturbing pattern as the Cobalt breakdown,"" House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton said about the email exchange he revealed on Wednesday.

When asked by reporters about the emails after the hearing, Barra said, ""I think the important thing is, as it relates to stalls, we consider stalls to be a safety issue. And if it is because of a defect, we're going to take action.""

'FRANKLY ALARMING'

Barra appeared alongside Anton Valukas, the GM-hired investigator who delivered a report earlier this month about the recall scandal that spared top executives and pinned blame on lower-level engineers and lawyers.

The report said those employees either did not appreciate the danger of the flaw or did not share the risk with their superiors.

Barra, who became CEO only in January but is a GM veteran of more than 30 years, has said she did not become aware of the problem until December 2013 and was not fully briefed until January of this year.

""That the most senior GM executives may not have known about a defect that caused more than a dozen deaths is frankly alarming and does not absolve them of responsibility for this tragedy,"" said Democratic Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado.

The company has pushed out 15 employees since the recalls were announced, including some high-ranking officials, but the departures have not affected the top level of executives.

The most senior executive on the Andres email chain about the Impala was Ed Koerner, who was named vice president of North American engineering in spring 2005, before Andres sent her first email. He retired in 2009. He could not immediately be reached for comment.

Another familiar name on the Andres email chain was former GM engineer Ray DeGiorgio, one of the 15 employees pushed out. The former company engineer initially approved an ignition switch design for the Cobalt that did not meet company specifications. He later approved a redesign without changing the part number, an unheard-of move in the industry.

EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW

Lawmakers also said they are concerned that the number of recalls connected to ignition-switch issues continues to grow.

GM's recalls this year include one last Friday for more than half a million Chevrolet Camaros for an ignition-switch issue that is not related to the earlier recall of Cobalts and other small cars.

GM is taking recall-related charges of $2 billion so far this year. GM has not tied any fatalities to the more recent ignition-related recalls.

""We are currently conducting what I believe is the most exhaustive, comprehensive safety review in the history of the company,"" Barra said on Wednesday.

CHRYSLER PROBES

But lawmakers pounced on the mounting recalls as potential evidence of bigger safety problems at GM.

Republican Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, chairman of the oversight subcommittee holding the hearing, said the latest ignition-related recalls are ""hauntingly similar"" to the prior recalls connected to more than 13 deaths.

Separately on Wednesday, U.S. safety regulators said they have opened two investigations into Chrysler Group vehicles involving possibly faulty ignition switches that can be bumped out of the ""run"" position, disabling air bags in the event of a crash.

The issue is similar to the GM recalls. No deaths or injuries are linked to the ignition-switch issue suspected in about 1.25 million vehicles covering five Chrysler models involved in the new investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency said. Chrysler is a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI.

COMPENSATION FUND

Barra said in her testimony on Wednesday that GM is addressing any and all safety concerns. She also said the company is committed to change.

""I want this terrible experience permanently etched in our collective memories. This is a tragic problem that never should have happened. And it must never happen again.""

Barra also said a compensation fund that GM is creating will cover all victims who suffered a serious physical injury, as well as families of victims who died. She said there will not be a cap on the fund.

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of GM's response to the ignition issues, on Wednesday morning gathered with victims' families and called on GM to fully compensate those impacted.

""All the consequences should be compensated and they should be done without the need for elaborate standards of proof or reconstruction of accidents,"" he said.

GM and Barra have so far weathered the scandal with few signs of permanent damage. The automaker's May U.S. sales were up 12.6 percent from the prior year, well above analyst expectations, and its share price is slightly stronger than just before the announcement of the first ignition-related recall on Feb. 13.

Also, GM on Wednesday received more awards for initial quality from J.D. Power than any other automaker in the U.S. market.

LONDON Bayer (BAYGn.DE) has signed a $14.2 billion acquisition loan backing its purchase of U.S.-based Merck's (MRK.N) consumer care business, the lead banks said in a statement on Wednesday.

The loan was underwritten on an equal basis by mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas and Mizuho Bank and saw strong support from Bayer's core relationship banks with 23 banks joining in syndication.

Mandated led arrangers were BBVA, Santander, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, RBS, Societe Generale, SMBC and Unicredit.

Lead arrangers were ANZ, Bank of New York Mellon, BayernLB, ING, Intesa SanPaolo, Helaba and SEB.

The financing comprises a $12.2 billion bridge to capital markets facility and a $2 billion medium-term facility. The one-year bridge loan pays 25 basis points (bps) over Libor, while the four-year facility pays 50 bps, as previously reported.

The bridge loan is expected to be taken out in the capital markets through a combination of senior and hybrid corporate bonds.

The financing is Bayer's largest loan financing since its 16.5 billion euro ($22.35 billion) acquisition of domestic rival Schering in 2006, which was funded with a 7 billion euro syndicated loan and a 7 billion euro bridge loan via Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

Bayer is rated A- by Standard & Poor's, A3 by Moody's and A by Fitch.

NEW YORK Applications for U.S. home mortgages fell sharply last week as interest rates increased, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 9.2 percent in the week ended June 13.

The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications dropped 12.7 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 4.7 percent.

Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.36 percent in the week, up 2 basis points from 4.34 percent the week before.

""Interest rates increased relative to the previous week as incoming economic data continues to suggest a pickup in the pace of growth,"" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist.

The survey covers over 75 percent of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.

MONACO Eric Knight, chief executive of activist fund manager Knight Vinke, believes Swiss bank UBS will eventually follow his advice and split its wealth management business from its investment bank.

Speaking on the sidelines of the GAIM hedge fund conference in Monaco, Knight said he saw no reason to sell his firm's stake in UBS, despite the bank showing little interest in breaking up.

""There's no reason to sell out. I'm still highly convinced they will do it. It may take a bit of time but they'll get there in the end,"" he said.

Knight believes UBS's wealth management business would thrive on its own and took a roughly 1 percent stake last year to campaign for a split.

UBS, meanwhile, has said the two businesses work together closely, bringing benefits to both.

""Forget what UBS is saying and look at what it's doing,"" said Knight, referring to UBS's plan to create a new corporate structure to ensure it can be broken up more easily in a crisis.

Knight said UBS was effectively creating a 'good' bank for its wealth management unit and a 'bad' bank that contains its investment banking unit and other non-core assets.

He added that while it had initially presented this as an internal process, it had subsequently announced a so-called exchange offer, under which it will swap shares into a new group holding company - meaning its businesses could be separated more easily if one ran into trouble, without jeopardising others.

That ""suggests to me their thinking has moved,"" Knight said.

""Who knows, maybe they ... may spin off the good bank ... reduce risk and give shareholders as much as 100 times more value than the 25 cents special dividend they're planning to issue as a sweetener,"" he said, referring to the dividend UBS announced to accompany its exchange offer.

A spokesman for UBS said the bank doesn't comment on individual investor opinions, but appreciated being seen as a long-term investment.

When the bank outlined the plans to alter its legal structure last month Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said the investment bank was ""doing well and requires no strategic changes."" Ermotti also said that the bank's overall strategy, business model and the way it serves clients were not affected by the changes.

UBS's plan follows measures to meet tougher rules imposed by regulators, who are eager to prevent a repeat of 2008 when Swiss taxpayers had to save the bank from losses in the United States.

REGULAR DIALOGUE

In terms of Knight Vinke's response to the exchange offer, Knight said it was not yet speaking to other shareholders but would ""do so in due course"".

He said his firm had a generally good relationship with the UBS board.

""We have at least a quarterly, if not more regular, dialogue with management; we meet with (finance chief) Tom Naratil and his colleagues. We also write to the board quite frequently and have a dialogue with the chairman.

""Although it can be a bit difficult, there's nothing personal.""

Knight said his firm's stake in UBS, which was bought at around 10 Swiss francs compared with the current share price of about 18 francs, was showing a ""very nice return"".

He was also satisfied with his firm's stake in French retailer Carrefour.

""Averaged out, we're showing a profit on the position again,"" he said, after Carrefour stock bounced back from a low of around 14 to 15 euros to around 26 to 27 euros now.

""We haven't sold out, we think there's more to go. We have great confidence in the chairman and have an excellent working relationship with him.""

While the year had started off less favourably than 2013, when Knight Vinke made a return of 37 percent across its portfolio in dollar terms, Knight was confident of improvement.

""This year is a different year, a different market, but I think it could turn out to be a very good year as well,"" said Knight, who has half a dozen ""significant"" investments of $100 million or more, along with several smaller ones.

""It was a bit slower starting off but I think we're close to seeing change on a number of things and if UBS starts to take off it could be a nice contributor.""

624,"LONDON Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday that China's economy would not suffer a hard landing and would continue to grow at a medium to high pace in the long term without strong stimulus.

Li made the comments during a speech in London's financial district on the final day of a visit which has yielded trade and investment deals worth 14 billion pounds ($23.76 billion) and strengthened Britain's bid to become the dominant centre for the Western trade in offshore yuan CNH=.

Li said he expected China's economy, the world's second-largest behind the United States, to grow at a minimum clip of 7.5 percent, confounding critics, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who say the country's rapid growth may eventually falter.

""There have been some discussions saying that the Chinese economy is slowing down, they are worried whether the Chinese economy will head to a hard landing. Here I will be very frank and I will also make this point very solemnly: this will not happen,"" Li said through a translator.

Li's comments were echoed by People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. At an event later in London on cooperation in foreign exchange markets, Zhou said he was confident that steady growth and financial stability would ensure market confidence in China's currency, the yuan, officially known as the renminbi (RMB).

Speaking at the same event, British finance minister George Osborne compared the growing importance of China's currency to the emergence of the dollar as the world's reserve currency after World War Two, saying the yuan's growth would be one of the major changes in global finance over coming decades.

China is looking to Britain's financial sector to help promote the use of its currency in international trade. Britain is keen to fend off rivals such as Luxembourg, New York, Paris and Frankfurt, also vying for the offshore yuan business.

""London is the largest offshore RMB market, so the UK should really seize on this momentum to consolidate its position as one of the most important offshore RMB markets outside Asia,"" Li told policymakers and bankers at the currency-focused event.

SMART, TARGETED STIMULUS

China and Britain announced a deal for London's first clearing bank in renminbi and announced the first direct trading between sterling and renminbi.

China Construction Bank, the country's second-largest lender, will become the first clearing bank in London for renminbi. Asset managers Blackrock (BLK.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) were granted licences allowing them to invest in Chinese securities in local currency.

Osborne said British companies exporting to China would in future be able to get government credit insurance for contracts denominated in yuan. London should explore deepening ties with the stock exchanges of Hong Kong and Shanghai, he said.

In response to a weak start for the Chinese economy this year, Beijing has announced modest stimulus measures including a relaxation of some banks' reserve requirements, tax breaks and accelerated infrastructure investment.

On Wednesday, Li used his speech to stress that Beijing would not resort to ""strong stimulus"" to meet its growth targets but would instead rely on smart and targeted measures.

""We have the ability to maintain this targeted approach,"" Li said in his speech. ""We will not resort to strong stimulus, but rather smart and targeted regulation to ensure that major economic indicators, including the 7.5 percent growth target, remain and ensure a sustained rate in the future.""

Earlier this month, the IMF recommended that China adopt an economic growth target of about 7 percent for 2015, rather than the government's 7.5 percent target. The IMF also urged the authorities to avoid further stimulus measures and concentrate on curtailing financial risks.

Spreadsheets with astonishing forecasts can only tell so much about China’s economic miracle. The sole path to believing, or at least comprehending, the scale of the country’s development is to see it. And so it is with any attempt to grasp Macau’s transformation from a Portuguese trading outpost to the Middle Kingdom’s gambling and entertainment hub.

Each year, this territory of about 30 square km a one-hour ferry ride from Hong Kong creates the equivalent of one new Las Vegas in gross gambling revenue. Millions of Chinese mainlanders aspire to visit – not just high-rollers but regular punters and even families. Macau will occupy an important role in China’s cultural and economic future. What’s questionable is whether investors will ever access Macau’s riches to the degree once deemed possible.

How can you be both bullish on Macau and bearish on its investment prospects? Simple: like all things China-related, the primary risk factor is the state, or more aptly China’s Communist Party. And when it comes to gambling, which is illegal in China, it is particularly hard to square Beijing’s goals with a business model where billions of dollars of wealth is transferred into the pockets of a few tycoons in the United States and Hong Kong.

This is not to diminish the scale of ambition and execution taking place on the spit of land first lent to the Portuguese in 1557, which was handed back to China in 1999. While Macau granted the first official gambling monopoly in 1962, it expanded the system to six licensees in 2002, including three American-led groups, Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage; and three locals, Melco Crown Entertainment, SJM Holdings (the original monopoly) and Galaxy Entertainment. All have listed their Macau operations on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In the past eight years Macau gambling revenue has surged from less than $10 billion to around $50 billion this year. And there’s more to come. Some $40 billion of capital has been devoted to 14 new developments, largely on the Cotai Strip, a stretch of reclaimed land south of the old colony that is a maelstrom of cranes, construction and Maybachs.

Extraordinary efforts to remove transportation bottlenecks to Macau will ensure the new casinos and hotels are occupied. In 2017, a 50-kilometer bridge will connect Hong Kong’s airport – with its projected 70 million yearly visitors – to Macau and Zhuhai, the city of 1.6 million just over the Chinese border. Pylons of the bridge, which will whisk visitors to Macau in the time it takes to reach the center of Hong Kong from the airport, can be seen poking out of the Pearl River Estuary.

Over the next four years, CLSA projects the authorities will permit the opening of 2,000 new gaming tables in the Cotai casinos, helping push gross gambling revenue above the $66 billion generated in 2013 by all U.S. casinos, to $90 billion in 2018 – and $18 billion of net profit. By that logic, the broker estimates the Macau gambling sector’s market cap can double to nearly $350 billion.

Visiting Macau, it is easy to buy this bull case. The Chinese cultural affinity for gambling is hard to overstate. Underpinning the activity is an extraordinary ambition to become wealthy, which has driven the country’s economic success since Deng Xiaoping expounded on the glories of getting rich. Gaming goes back farther, with archaeological evidence of dice from 600 BC.

The Chinese also hold a strong belief in the powers of good fortune and a fascination with numerology. These come together perfectly on the tables of a casino, specifically in games like baccarat where luck is the sole determinant of success, and turnover is most intense. The game dominates the floors of Macau’s casinos. Indeed, it is harder to find a blackjack or poker table at a Chinese casino than it is to circumvent China’s capital controls.

Which brings us to the risks: Gambling is still a crime in China. Mao Zedong considered it a societal ill and enshrined its prohibition in Article 303 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic. China charged nearly 350,000 citizens with gambling violations in 2012 alone, according to OnlineBetting.com.

Squaring this with the idea that Beijing will forever allow casino operators free rein to fleece ordinary Chinese, who will make up the bulk of future visitors to Macau, is hard to fathom. It may not happen for years – the concessions are under review in about five years – but China will eventually exercise greater rights over the winnings at Macau’s houses.

Glimmers of such intervention are already apparent. Chinese visitors are only permitted to take $3,200 a day in cash out of the country. To circumvent this, many purchase expensive watches and gifts from Macau’s pawnshops or jewelers in transactions through Chinese credit-card issuer UnionPay and then convert the goods into cash. A May crackdown on some of these purchases may point to a general change of attitude. Similarly, this week Macau said it will reduce from seven to five the number of days that Chinese visitors with transit visas can stay in the city.

Macau’s supporters argue it offers a “release valve” of sorts, a place where some erosion of capital controls and illicit behavior is tolerated. That made sense when Macau’s visitors were primarily high-rollers, even senior officials, whose trips to Macau could be monitored and catalogued.

It’s harder to accomplish when the new visitor is a family coming in on the high-speed train from Wuhan five hours away. The father may want to gamble $20,000 on sic bo, the Chinese dice game, at the Grand Lisboa while the mother shops at the Galaxy’s boutiques and their daughter wakes up to a “Shrekfast” in her Venetian hotel room. Perhaps they will take in a Canto-pop show as well.

The expansion of this mass market, which is more profitable for casinos because it eliminates middle men known as junket operators, changes the game for Macau and for China. It makes it harder to support a wholesale transfer of wealth to billionaires like Steve Wynn, Pansy Ho or Sheldon Adelson, the Sands mogul who pledged $100 million to Mitt Romney’s U.S. presidential campaign – during which the candidate criticized Barack Obama for not labeling China a currency manipulator.

It won’t happen overnight. And some semblance of the rule of law precludes a Latin American-style expropriation. But a betting man would find favored odds on a long-term erosion of the status quo in Macau for global investors. In the meantime, though, the place will only grow bigger, more garish and more lucrative for some. The trick will be in knowing when to fold.",China Macau tolerance won’t last forever,http://blogs.reuters.com,"[Posted Article, Rob Cox, Posted Katrina Hamlin]",http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/files/2014/06/or_272_Macau.jpg,2014-06-17 00:00:00,en,http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/06/17/china-macau-tolerance-wont-last-forever/

At the opening of the Confederations Cup in Brasilia a year ago, President Dilma Rousseff was booed by thousands of soccer fans for all of Brazil to see. It’s easy to understand then why she isn’t planning to speak at Thursday’s opening ceremony of the World Cup. An embarrassing turn as host of Earth’s biggest sporting event – or crushing repeat of the 1950 Maracanaço – may be the greatest obstacle to her clinching a second term.

With each dip in Rousseff’s poll numbers, the Bovespa Index kicks up a notch. Investors are hoping her experimental economic policies will come to an end at the ballot this fall.

With unemployment still low and millions of Brazilians lifted out of poverty over the past decade, however, it will take more than a few lousy economic reports between now and then to ensure Rousseff’s defeat. It will take a truly dreadful showing at the World Cup.

While few Brazilians are openly disparaging the home team, that many are privately reflecting on such an outcome is an indication of the malaise infecting Latin America’s largest economy. Inflation remains stubbornly high, hitting 6.4 percent just last week, gross domestic product growth is sluggish and the government’s finances are in bad shape.

“My bet is that it is so bad that you’re going to see regime change come the October elections,” Michael Novogratz, the principal at Fortress Investment Group, with $63 billion under management, said at the Sohn Investment Conference in May. Rousseff is “praying for the soccer team, like all Brazilians, to maybe give the country a lift and her to get some momentum from it.”

The case against Rousseff’s economic leadership is robust. Flawed design and execution of monetary, industrial and fiscal policies have combined to propel Brazil from the ranks of the anointed emerging growth markets to an economic damp squib. Since the start of 2011, when Rousseff took office, Brazilian stocks have lost about a quarter of their value. The real has fallen nearly as much against the U.S. dollar. Last week, Rousseff attributed the market performance to “an ill mood toward Brazil” – certainly not her administration’s policies.

This explains the inverse correlation between Rousseff’s poll numbers and Brazilian assets. At the beginning of the year, her approval ratings stood above 40 percent. They have drifted steadily downward, touching 34 percent in a poll released on Friday by Datafolha. During this period, the Bovespa, which includes the most liquid stocks on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, has gained more than 15 percent. Tellingly, shares of Petrobras have gained twice as much, including a 5 percent bounce on Friday after the release of the president’s latest approval ratings.

That stands to reason. The energy giant has borne the brunt of Rousseff’s industrial meddling. Though the company, whose board Rousseff used to chair, discovered vast deep-sea reserves in 2007, its crude output has been stagnant since then thanks to a combination of strict limits on foreign control, onerous buy-local requirements and government demands that Petrobras build costly refineries and supply fuel at below-market rates.

On the macroeconomic front, the picture is similarly dismaying. Standard & Poor’s downgraded the country’s credit rating in March to just one notch above junk, citing a “combination of fiscal slippage, the prospect that fiscal execution will remain weak amid subdued growth in the coming years, a constrained ability to adjust policy ahead of the elections, and some weakening in Brazil’s external accounts.” That’s a lot to worry about.

Despite all this, there’s a problem with what Novogratz dubbed the “so bad, it’s good” thesis. What appears clear to hedge fund moguls, credit analysts and economists is far from the minds of the average Brazilian voter. For starters, unemployment is below 5 percent, a stat that would probably secure re-election for any U.S. or European incumbent.

Moreover, since her predecessor and mentor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva first took over in 2003, some 35 million Brazilians have been lifted from poverty into the middle class. This is still the trump card for the Workers’ Party, especially against Rousseff’s most likely opponent in a runoff, Aecio Neves. The former Minas Gerais governor is the wealthy scion of a leading political family. Painting him as an out-of-touch playboy won’t be difficult.

True, inflation is stubbornly high. But for many Brazilian workers, their paychecks are also going up as a result of the tight labor market and mandated inflation adjustments. Consumer credit, the lifeblood of the growing Brazilian middle class, is slowing but still flowing. Productivity growth is not matching wage inflation, thus storing up problems to come. And the government will struggle to reach its target for a primary surplus without resorting to creative accounting.

All of this can probably be held back until after October. Not so the World Cup. The beautiful game’s quadrennial pinnacle kicks off this week and will run for a month. Brazil’s ability to manage the spectacle, keep protests at bay and, eventually, win on the pitch (as Goldman Sachs and Itaú predict) – and dispel the curse of its 1950 loss in the final at home to Uruguay – will ultimately determine whether Rousseff gets a second chance.

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.

Fine-tuning and micro-management are close cousins. China’s central bank is tending toward the latter. The latest policy tweak will let some banks lend more to the rural sector, and fits a wider regulatory trend of selective easing. But it adds needless complexity, and takes China further from its stated goal of being more market-driven.

When growth is slowing and job creation is the top priority, adding more credit to the economy is a short-term fix. So from June 16, banks which lend mostly to the rural and small business sector will only need to keep 16 percent of their deposits with the People’s Bank of China’s rather than the current 16.5 percent. The result is that these rural specialists can lend more; no such goodies for the bigger banks prone to propping up foolhardy property developers.

The stimulus, though, is likely to be small. Size up the two-thirds of city-level banks and majority of small rural lenders which qualify, and the tweak could release just 50 billion yuan of extra funding power, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That compares with 774 billion yuan of new loans made in April overall. Other regulatory restraints, like the cap on loans as a percentage of deposits, further dull the impact. Nor are small businesses and farmers obviously in dire need, even if they are most often shunned by big banks.

Why bother with such a trifle? One reason is that the PBOC has a dual role, supporting growth but also avoiding financial excesses. Sometimes those goals conflict, and this kind of fudge may be the result. The central bank may have more self-seeking motives too. Stratifying banks and pledging to step up scrutiny over where they lend adds more work, but also more influence – and suggests a subtle challenge to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, which oversees individual lenders.

The main effect, though, is to increase the sense that China’s gradual approach to reform is lapsing into control freakery. Wanting to promote growth while minimising unintended consequences is understandable. But if the goal is to end up with a market-driven economy and less red tape, ceaseless fine-tuning sets the wrong tone.",China’s mini-stimulus verges on micro-management,http://blogs.reuters.com,[John Foley],http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/files/2014/06/or_610_Rural.jpg,2014-06-10 00:00:00,en,http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/06/10/chinas-mini-stimulus-verges-on-micro-management/

China is richer and more stable than when tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square 25 years ago. Then, incomplete political reforms led to chaos, violence and retrenchment. While there’s little risk of that now, a similar dynamic is playing out in the financial system.

These days, Chinese citizens mostly accept political restrictions. The authorities survey communications and police gatherings. Rapid income growth has made the memory of 1989 less relevant. Foreign investment, too, has flowed in. In 1990 China attracted $2.8 billion, according to the OECD. By 2013 that had grown almost forty-fold.

Financial restrictions have proved less binding. While deposit rates on bank accounts are capped at just over 3 percent for one-year savings, investors have chased a proliferation of more attractive products, both on- and off-line. Non-traditional credit in China’s economy, much of it backed by investment products that sit outside the official banking system, hit the equivalent of 68 percent of GDP in 2013, according to Barclays, having grown 31 percent in a year. Capital flight is a related problem, pushing up casino revenues in neighbouring Macau and house prices in London.

Wayward finance sounds like a trivial concern compared to the tens of thousands of students who demanded democracy in Beijing and other cities in the spring of 1989. But there are parallels. Then, just as now, reform was the watchword of the day as the ruling Party loosened its grip. When vested interests and corruption got in the way, citizens took up the fight. The result was disorder, and ultimately a direct threat to the Party’s ability to retain control.

There is little risk of mass unrest today – the security apparatus is fearsome and better funded; middle classes have more to lose. But financial chaos is an increasing risk. After such freewheeling growth, defaults and institutional failures are inevitable. A likely correction in the real estate sector will erase wealth from hundreds of millions of the savers. If growth slows too fast, some might question whether China’s leaders have kept up their side of the bargain.

The big danger is that once again, China’s leaders are unwilling to relinquish control. At best, the government will do just enough to avoid a breakdown of the financial order, and accept that markets mean a certain amount of unruliness. At worst, financial reform could go the way of political reform after 1989: backwards. The lesson of Tiananmen is that once the will to change vanishes, it can disappear for decades.",China wrestles with repression of financial sort,http://blogs.reuters.com,[John Foley],http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/files/2014/06/or_811_Tiananmen.jpg,2014-06-04 00:00:00,en,http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/06/04/china-wrestles-with-repression-of-financial-sort/

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.

A portrait of Milton Friedman hangs at the entrance to the Stauffer Auditorium at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. It carries no identification, and doesn’t need any. All who enter here can be counted on to recognize the patron saint of contemporary free-market economics. And so it was two days last week, when the leaders of what might be dubbed monetary fundamentalism gathered under Friedman’s watchful gaze.

Stanford’s John Taylor, a former Treasury official and academic who created an eponymous and influential rule for setting interest rates, pulled together sitting and former presidents of Federal Reserve banks, along with prominent academics and former members of the European Central Bank board. They discussed a new framework for running the world’s central banks.

The cries from this boil of hawks may not have changed much over the decades, but more than five years since the financial crisis roiled the world’s financial markets and economies they deserve a fresh listen.

The views vary, but there is a common creed: The U.S. central bank has expanded its discretionary powers in monetary and credit policy in ways that threaten its existence. This isn’t mere traditionalism. It is an admission by powerful central bankers that they understand their own limitations, and they would rather see their powers circumscribed than fail abjectly, since failure could lead to the dismantlement of Fed independence.

Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker stated it with some delicacy: “Entanglement in the distributional politics of credit allocation inevitably threatens the delicate equilibrium underlying central bank independence, which has been so essential to monetary stability.”

But there’s something more – a growing recognition that too much is expected of the Fed, and of other central banks. In the absence of meaningful support from fiscal policy, central banks have become the only stimulative game in town – particularly in the town of Washington. Each new power granted to non-elected monetary authorities creates cover for politicians’ inaction. That’s unhealthy for markets, the economy – and ultimately the Fed.

It’s tempting to dismiss this crew as old white guys railing at newfangled ways. With the exception of Kansas City Fed President Esther George, that was actually the case at the Stanford confab. Speakers one-upped each other with references to the Hawk Pantheon, from ancients like Adam Smith and Walter Bagehot to the more modern, Paul Volcker and Friedman (notably absent, but lingering in the air were the Austrians). The location was right: a temple dedicated to the president whose slow response to the 1929 stock market crash is usually thought to have turned a financial setback into the Great Depression.

But the Taylorites are not mere monetary policy Luddites. Two things have undeniably occurred since the 2008 financial crisis: Central bankers have been called upon to do extraordinary things, and political comity has taken a turn for the worse. And one may have enabled the other.

Consider all the Fed has done to save the world. There has been experimental monetary policy, including three waves of quantitative easing, leading to a multitrillion-dollar expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet. The Fed has gone out further on the risk spectrum in the types of assets it has purchased, and by extending its own maturities through the so-called Operation Twist.

It has also expanded its credit policy remit, participating in the rescues of AIG and Bear Stearns, converting Wall Street securities houses to banks. What’s more, it has in practice taken on the role of macroprudential regulator by effectively agreeing to monitor the financial markets for all incipient bubbles.

At the same time, America’s political body has fractured. Hopes for a “Grand Bargain” on spending and taxation just a few years ago proved vain. Instead, there is hardened partisanship. Deficits have shrunk, but by legislative accident, not by anything like intelligent design.

Monetary policy has been forced to pick up much of the slack, entrenching a form of massive moral hazard. The Fed fundamentalists recognize the risk. As Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser put it to the Stanford crowd: “We need to do what we know we can do well.” The more tasks attached to the Fed, “the harder it gets for us to do what we are best at.”

Politicians, voters and investors have perhaps grown accustomed to thinking of central bankers as wizards. But these days, they are more like explorers hacking their way through a snake-infested swamp. It would be healthy to acknowledge the limits of their abilities, before failure exposes them. It might even get legislators back in the business of, well, legislating.",Fed fundamentalists deserve fresh listen,http://blogs.reuters.com,"[Rob Cox, Posted Georgebmac]",http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/files/2014/06/or_937_Fed.jpg,2014-06-03 00:00:00,en,http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/06/03/rob-cox-fed-fundamentalists-deserve-fresh-listen/

It’s almost a year since U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held a cordial “shirt-sleeves summit”. When it comes to the two countries’ internet rivalry, however, bare knuckles have replaced bare forearms. Last week’s indictment by the United States of five Chinese army officers as alleged cyber spies has prompted a backlash against American companies. China’s weapon is shutting them out from future growth.

China responded with predictable speed after the Federal Bureau of Investigation put the hackers on its “Most Wanted” list. The mainland plans to scrutinise foreign information technology vendors in the name of national security. Companies which fail security checks could be blacklisted from supplying products and services. State media reported authorities would also ban Windows 8 from government computers. Meanwhile, the government is discouraging state-owned companies from using foreign management consultants like McKinsey, according to the Financial Times.

It’s hard to know how seriously China will enforce this stance. Even so, the threat is potent. Though the World Trade Organisation bans its members from discriminating against foreign imports, it allows exceptions for national security. That is how the U.S. government keeps Chinese telecom equipment companies like Huawei and ZTE out.

The few Western groups that report their China sales suggest the figures are limited. Consumer electronics group Apple is on the high side: 15 percent of its sales went to China last year, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. It’s hard to see the Chinese government preventing its citizens from owning iPhones. Companies which focus on corporate sales may be more vulnerable, but also have less to lose. For American telecom equipment-maker Cisco Systems, China accounted for only 3 percent of its sales of network backbone equipment in the third quarter of 2013, according to Ovum analysts.

Nevertheless, the threat China might freeze U.S. companies out of its e-commerce boom is a potent one. China sales are already falling at companies like IBM and Cisco, raising the risk that they will miss a key source of future growth. The mainland will fuel roughly a quarter of global growth in core network equipment to 2018, according to Ovum.

638,"June 18 Rory McIlroy says he will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, putting an end to speculation that he may have chosen to play for Great Britain instead.

The 25-year-old two-time major winner was born in Northern Ireland and could have represented both Ireland at Britain when golf returns to the Olympic stage for the first time since 1904.

""I see this as a continuation of what I have always done,"" he was reported as saying on Wednesday ahead of the Irish Open at the Fota Golf Club in Cork.

""I have been thinking about it a lot. I don't know if it is because the World Cup is in Brazil and I was thinking a couple of years down the line.

""I was thinking about all the times I have played for Ireland as a boy and everything. For me it is the right decision to play for Ireland.""

McIlroy, who recently split from his fiancee, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, had earlier said ""he would probably play for Great Britain"", and in 2013 suggested he may miss the tournament altogether to avoid controversy over any decision.

""I was always very proud to put on the Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very proud to do it again,"" he added.

""Just because now that I'm playing golf for money and I'm a professional, I'm supposed to have this choice or this decision to make, where if you look at the rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players, they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf.

""I don't think there's any point to change that or go against that just because it's a different event or it's the Olympics.

""I've had a lot of time on my own the last few weeks and just been thinking about it a lot. It's something that's been quite important to me and something that I needed to make some sort of decision or some sort of stand on it.

640,"June 17 Ireland's first Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley returns to action on home soil this week fired up by German Martin Kaymer's emphatic US Open triumph last Sunday.

A satisfied observer of Kaymer's eight-shot win at Pinehurst, North Carolina, McGinley was 'buzzing' on Tuesday ahead of playing in the Irish Open at Fota Island Resort, where he won the first of his four Irish PGA Championships in 1997.

""On the back of Martin's win, it creates a buzz for everybody at this tournament, everybody in the European Tour in the background and obviously me (as) Ryder Cup captain,"" said McGinley.

""It is exciting. There are a lot of exciting players in the field. Obviously Rory McIlroy is going to get a lot of attention and Graeme McDowell, too. It's all good and there is a good buzz around the place.""

With all four Major champions from both sides of the Irish border in the field - Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington, McDowell and McIlroy - McGinley is looking forward to big home crowds at the event, which has returned to Cork for the first time in 12 years.

""I think some venues are blessed with good weather and Fota Island seems to be blessed,"" added McGinley, who will lead the European team against the United States at Gleneagles in Scotland in September.

""The last time we were here the weather was sensational, as well, and looks like we are going to have a tremendous week too, the way the forecast is.""

Ryder Cup stalwart Harrington, who finished tied second and tied sixth when the Irish Open was last played at Fota Island, in 2001 and 2002, was equally happy at the prospect of a return.

""It's obviously been a happy hunting ground for me over the years. I do like the venue. I like the atmosphere the venue gives off,"" said the three-time major champion.

Englishman Casey, who won last year's 72-hole event by three strokes, said the combination of the Irish fans' enthusiasm and a chance to secure places at the British Open, to be played at Royal Liverpool, Hoylake, ensured great excitement.

""I think it's wonderful that players will have the opportunity to qualify at the Irish Open,"" said Casey. ""I have always loved playing in Ireland - and the support from the Irish fans when I won last year was phenomenal.

""The fact that three places in The Open are on the line at this year's tournament will create even more excitement for the spectators and the players.""

The Irish Open is part of a new Open Qualifying Series, and the top three finishers from a 156-strong international field, from 23 nations, earn places at Hoylake.

644,"June 16 As Germans celebrated a 4-0 World Cup win over Portugal and welcome news regarding the health of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher, one major sports story appears to have gone largely unnoticed - a first U.S. Open golf title.

Martin Kaymer's eight-stroke victory in North Carolina on Sunday was greeted with widespread praise within golfing circles, but the 29-year-old's runaway triumph barely registered in soccer-mad Germany as the World Cup kicked off in Brazil.

""I feel nothing about his win... no sorrow, no happiness,"" said Berlin accountancy firm employee Anne Ihle, adding that Kaymer's victory had been ""buried"" in an avalanche of news about Germany's bid to end an 18-year soccer title drought.

It was ""bad timing"", said Christian Hansel, a 38-year-old product manager. He was not a golf fan but did remember Bernhard Langer, who along with Kaymer is the only other German to have won two majors, with Masters titles in 1985 and 1993.

The top-selling German daily Bild, which runs a ""winner"" and ""loser"" column on its front page, put Kaymer in both categories on Tuesday, remarking that ""Germans are only talking about the Schumi-wonder and the start of the team's World Cup bid"".

On Monday, seven times Formula One champion Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident last year, had come out of a coma and was transferred to a Swiss medical centre, officials said, without giving details of his condition.

RETURN TO FORM

Despite the other big stories, the German golfing community did pay attention to Kaymer's win, according to Timo Schlitz, who covers the sport on the Golf.de website, telling Reuters that traffic rose substantially during the U.S. Open.

German Golf Association chairman Marcus Neumann added that the lack of media attention would not diminish the scintillating return to form for Kaymer, whose rise to the number one ranking after winning the 2010 PGA Championship proved short-lived.

""For the golfing world itself, it doesn't matter; for Kaymer it doesn't matter. He will pass into golf history and in a few years nobody will talk about it coinciding with the World Cup,"" Neumann told Reuters.

He believed that Kaymer - who himself wanted to be a professional soccer player - would be rooting for his friends on the German squad, like Bastian Schweinsteiger, who sat out Monday's game, and Lukas Podolski, who tweeted about Kaymer's ""legendary performance"" just before the match against Portugal.

Kaymer is due to play at the BMW International Open in Cologne next week and despite the tournament taking place during the World Cup, Neumann still expects to see an increase in public and media interest thanks to his U.S. Open victory.

""The parking lots in Cologne are going to be crowded with spectators,"" Neumann said.

646,"PINEHURST, North Carolina, June 16 Martin Kaymer's astonishing dominance at the U.S. Open, on a challenging Pinehurst layout where only two other players finished under par, left his rivals purring in admiration.

More significantly, the German's eight-stroke victory at the year's second major has elevated him into elite company, and one can only wonder how much more the ultra-talented, hard-working Kaymer will achieve by the time his career is over.

Aged just 29, he has already claimed two major titles and been world number one, joining Seve Ballesteros, Ernie Els, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy as the only players to do so before turning 30 since the official rankings were launched in 1986.

He became the seventh player to complete a wire-to-wire victory at the U.S. Open but his winning margin puts him in rare company with only Woods, Louis Oosthuizen and McIlroy clinching majors in such one-sided fashion over the past two decades.

Woods triumphed by a record 15 strokes in the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, South African Oosthuizen coasted home by seven in the 2010 British Open at St. Andrews and McIlroy landed the 2011 U.S. Open by eight shots at a rain-softened Congressional.

McIlroy has thrilled golf fans with his own electrifying talent over the past few years while winning two major titles before the age of 24 but even he was left shaking his head in amazement as Kaymer crushed the world's best at Pinehurst.

""I'm wondering how he did it,"" Northern Irishman McIlroy said after tying for 23rd at the U.S. Open on Sunday, finishing a distant 15 strokes behind Kaymer.

""I think I made a total of nine birdies this week, and I don't see any more out there. It's tough. Obviously, if you limit the mistakes, you might end up a couple under par for the week, because you're always going to make a few mistakes.

""But to do what he's doing is, I think it's nearly more impressive than what I did at Congressional.""

Kaymer won his first major title in a playoff for the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, then became world number one in February 2011 before deciding to retool his swing in a bid to become a better all-round player.

LEAN SPELL

While working hard to introduce a right-to-left draw to a game that had previously depended on a left-to-right fade, he endured a lengthy lean spell and his ranking steadily slipped to 63rd by April this year.

Throughout all those struggles, though, Kaymer never doubted that he would get back to where he felt he belonged.

""It shouldn't sound cocky or arrogant, but I knew it would come,"" said the Dusseldorf native, who was dubbed the 'Germanator' during his stellar 2010 campaign when he triumphed four times worldwide.

""I knew that I would play good golf again. There was enough belief there. I just didn't think it would take me that much time to get back to where I was.

""I think I play better golf now. I'm more of a complete player. It was just a matter of time. So it's not a huge surprise to me that I played good golf, it's just a surprise that I won such big tournaments. But I'll take it.""

Kaymer, an 11-times winner on the European Tour, clinched his second PGA Tour title last month at the prestigious Players Championship, an event widely regarded as the unofficial fifth major because of the extraordinary strength in its field.

That win gave the German a timely confidence boost, and he effectively turned the Pinehurst U.S. Open into a one-man show after opening with successive scores of five-under-par 65 on a tricky layout to seize a six-stroke lead.

With a second major crown that lifted him to 11 from 28 in the rankings, Kaymer is eager to add to an already glittering career resume while he embraces the challenge of vying with young guns such as McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, and older hands like Woods and Phil Mickelson, in golf's biggest events.

""I was really looking forward to competing against them and to see who has the stronger and better nerves coming down the last five, six holes in big tournaments,"" he said of his thoughts while working on his swing in 2011 and 2012.

""We have some players who are a little bit more experienced out here, like Tiger, Phil and those guys, and then you have different players that are 10, 12 years younger. So it's very wide. So much is happening in golf right now.

""It's a lot to look forward to. And I'm only 29 years old, so I hope I have another few years ahead of me.""

BELO HORIZONTE Brazil Despite losing their opening match, Algeria fans were still beaming with pride at their team's performance and status as the only Arab nation present at the World Cup.

Algeria went down 2-1 to highly rated Belgium on Tuesday, yet they at least scored a goal at the finals for the first time since 1986 and were on course for a famous upset until the Europeans struck twice in the last 20 minutes.

Aware the Arab region's hopes rest on his team, despite his own Franco-Bosnian roots, coach Vahid Halilhodzic praised his players as ""heroic"" and took heart ahead of the remaining Group H games against South Korea and Russia.

""We came so close to writing a glorious passage in football history,"" said Algerian lawyer Brahim Kateb, 37, draped in the green-and-white national flag with a red star and crescent.

""I am so sad we lost, yet so proud of what we showed to the world. It is a time of many mixed emotions,"" the fan added.

Algeria was also the sole representative for the Middle East and North Africa at the 2010 World Cup, though pride was dented by failing to score and finishing bottom of their group.

There has been an injection of fresh talent since then, with the 2014 ""Desert Foxes"" side constructed around French-born players drawn from the massive migrant population in Europe.

PRAYER CELEBRATION

Against Belgium, the Algerians showed tactical guile and steel at the back along with a willingness to drive forward, especially in the first half before they began to tire.

They also wore their Muslim faith proudly, kneeling in prayer together near the corner flag in front of their fans to celebrate Sofiane Feghouli's successful penalty to open the scoring.

Few in global football circles noticed when Algeria recently crept above Ivory Coast to become Africa's highest team in FIFA's rankings despite the absence of big-name stars.

""We are not a bad team at all these days,"" said Algerian scientist Amr Kadi, 33, hoarse from shouting his team on.

""We deserve to be here and to represent our region. You should see all the messages and texts and emails from people supporting Algeria all around the Arab region.""

Algeria's World Cup appearance has helped divert attention away from worries at home over the fragile health of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and political turmoil in neighbouring nations.

Many fans in nearby Egypt and Tunisia believe acute unrest in their nations undermined their own qualifying campaigns.

""We are here to have fun, to make Arab peoples proud and happy,"" said 52-year-old businessman and Algeria fan Laouika Bohran.

ROME Italy midfielder Antonio Candreva has become a Lazio player after the Serie A club ended a co-ownership arrangement with Udinese, amid speculation that the 27-year-old could be on his way to Paris St Germain.

""Lazio communicates that it has resolved in its favour the co-ownership of the footballer Antonio Candreva,"" the club wrote on its website on Tuesday.

Candreva has played for Lazio for two seasons, first as a loanee from Udinese and then under a co-ownership deal common in Italy, and his 12 goals for the Rome-based side last season had reportedly attracted the attention of the French champions.

Candreva also impressed in Italy's 2-1 win over England in their opening Group D match in the World Cup at the weekend, providing a pinpoint cross for Mario Balotelli's 50th minute winner.

Lazio also announced that within a few days they would complete the signing of Udinese midfielder Dusan Basta.

The 29-year-old Serbia international can play in Candreva's favoured position on the right flank and could be a replacement for the Italian, should he move on.

Lazio president Claudio Lotito, however, moved quickly to quell speculation surrounding Candreva's future, saying he was not on the market, amid reports that Juventus were also interested in the exciting playmaker.

""Candreva is not for sale. We have not spoken to anyone from PSG and we have not received any offers,"" Lotito said.

Any sale of Candreva would likely provoke an angry reaction from Lazio's volatile fans, who abandoned the Olympic Stadium en masse in protest last season at what they saw as a chronic lack of ambition from Lotito.

They were also livid at the January sale of Brazilian midfielder Hernanes to Inter Milan.

Lazio finished ninth in Serie A after an inconsistent season that saw them struggle amid the fan protests and the sacking of Vladimir Petkovic in January.

They will begin next season with Stefano Pioli as coach after Edy Reja left the post at the end of last campaign.

654,"BRASILIA Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa produced a heroic performance in a 0-0 draw with Brazil and his Russian counterpart Igor Akinfeev was the villain in a 1-1 draw with South Korea as the World Cup produced more drama on Tuesday.

While Ochoa kept Brazil at bay, the hapless Akinfeev was left to bury his head in his hands after he allowed Lee Keun-ho's straightforward shot from 25 metres to slip through his grasp.

Algeria ended their 28-year wait for a World Cup goal when they took a shock lead against Belgium although it was not enough as the highly-rated Europeans hit back to win 2-1 in the day's other match.

Ochoa produced four world class saves to deny Paulinho, Neymar (twice) and Thiago Silva when they seemed certain to score in an intense, end-to-end match in tropical Fortaleza which left both teams with four points from two games in Group A.

Silva thought he had won the game in the closing minutes with a powerful header only to see his effort parried at point blank range by the Mexican keeper.

Despite the scoreline, the match was anything but dull and the Mexicans enjoyed long periods of possession, bravely taking the game to the hosts in the second half.

""I believe this was the best match of my life because this was a World Cup game and this is very important,"" said Ochoa.

""I don't know whether I can think of another goalkeeper in memory...someone who has done what Memo (Ochoa) did today,"" Mexico coach Miguel Herrera told a news conference.

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari also praised Ochoa, describing his performance as spectacular, and could not resist pointing out that this time, unlike the controversial 3-1 win over Croatia, his side had a late penalty appeal turned down.

""There was no penalty in favour of Brazil,"" said 'Big Phil', shrugging his shoulders.

Cameroon and Croatia, the other teams in the group, who are yet to get off the mark, meet in Manaus on Wednesday.

In the Group H clash in Cuiaba, Akinfeev's blushes on 68 minutes were spared when veteran Alexander Kerzhakov pounced to equalise for Russia after more scrappy goalkeeping by Jung Sung-ryong six minutes later.

Much-fancied Belgium were made to work hard for a 2-1 win over Algeria in Belo Horizonte after the North Africans took a shock lead with a Sofiane Feghouli penalty in the 25th minute.

It was Algeria’s first goal at the tournament since Djamel Zidane scored against Northern Ireland in a 1-1 draw in 1986.

Algeria played two more games at that tournament and three at the 2010 World Cup without scoring.

The Desert Foxes kept the lead until the last 20 minutes when goals from substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens turned the game around, much to the anger of Algeria coach Vahid Halilhodzic.

""It's a major disappointment,"" he said. ""I have a number of players that are rather limited, they're young, they're not that experienced, they can't play 90 minutes.

""Each Algerian player needs to improve his physical condition by 30 to 50 percent. The Belgian players are in much better shape.""

Portugal's troubles continued after their 4-0 thrashing by Germany on Monday when left back Fabio Coentrao was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a thigh muscle injury.

“It’s a very sad moment for me, and one that I want to forget as quickly as possible,” he told the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) website.

Defending champions Spain, who made an even worse start than Portugal when they were thrashed 5-1 by Netherlands in their opening match, face Chile in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.

Netherlands face Australia in Porto Alegre. ""There was no euphoria in the team. We have played Total Football. Nothing has changed in that respect. We are applying the Dutch principles,"" said flamboyant coach Louis van Gaal.

CUIABA Brazil Russia experienced despair then joy as Alexander Kerzhakov's stabbed equaliser made amends for goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev’s terrible blunder in an untidy 1-1 draw with South Korea at the World Cup on Tuesday.

The result left the teams in joint second place in Group H after the first round of matches behind leaders Belgium, who earlier came from behind to win 2-1 against Algeria in Belo Horizonte.

Kerzhakov, the sole surviving member of Russia's last World Cup team at the 2002 finals in Asia, scored in the 74th, three minutes after coming on, to notch his 26th international goal.

The 31-year-old swivelled and struck a shot from inside the six-yard box after fellow substitute Alan Dzagoev's effort was parried by goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong.

""I'm happy but I'm sorry at the end because we could have won the game. There was a wonderful reaction by our team after the goal we suffered,"" Russia coach Fabio Capello said.

""We developed a crescendo, we grew (in a way) that was important for me,"" he told reporters.

The South Koreans had taken the lead six minutes earlier when an awful blunder by Akinfeev handed substitute Lee Keun-ho the opening goal at the Pantanal arena.

The 2012 Asian Footballer of the Year unleashed a stinging shot from outside the box that the seasoned Akinfeev appeared to have under control but let slip from his grasp and over his shoulder into the net.

Korea's coach Hong Myung-bo said he told Lee when he sent him on that the Russians ""would be tired and slowing down and he should prepare for that and be more aggressive.

""I think our players really did their utmost on the pitch today. Tactically and physically each and every moment they played intelligently,"" Hong told reporters.

GOAL RELIEF

The match was lifted from its torpor by the goal after a chess-like first half of ebb and flow but little danger to the goalkeepers in which young South Korea striker Son Heung-min put two chances well over the bar.

In the 10th minute, Yoon Suk-young hit a long high ball down the left wing and Koo Ja-cheol headed it into the middle where Son took off on a fast diagonal run into the right side of the box where he shot too high.

The 21-year-old striker, a thorn in the Russian defence and voted man-of-the-match, had another chance in the 39th minute when he found space in the middle but his effort from the edge of the box again sailed high over the bar.

Capello said his players took time to get into the match.

""At the beginning, our players were so nervous, I don’t think they were as smooth as they normally are. After the goal we suffered, they reacted,"" he said.

Russia tried to stretch the Korean defence through Yury Zhirkov on the left wing and Alexander Samedov on the right.

Samedov found the angle too tight in the 20th minute and shot wide but on the half-hour when he was fouled 25 metres out by Ki Sung-yueng, who was booked, keeper Jung managed to beat away centre back Sergey Ignashevich's powerful free kick.

South Korea captain Koo had a shot deflected just wide of the post off the leg of his opposite number Vasili Berezutskiy for a corner in the closing minutes of the first half.

The goalkeepers were called more into action in the second period, Jung having to tip a Victor Faizulin shot over the bar almost from the restart.

At the other end, the experienced Akinfeev was equal to everything the Koreans threw at him, notably a bullet of a free kick from central defender Kim Young-gwon, but he fumbled the apparently easier shot he had to take from Lee.

Both sides, who at this stage look set to fight over second place, went all out for a win in the dying stages with Samedov ballooning a Russian chance high into the air after the ball had crossed the Korean box.

RIO DE JANEIRO Portugal midfielder Raul Meireles will not face punishment for raising his fingers in a gesture during his team's 4-0 World Cup thrashing by Germany on Monday, FIFA said on Tuesday.

""After analysis of the matter, in particular a review of the official video footage, the chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee has considered that there is no element justifying the opening of disciplinary proceedings,"" a FIFA spokeswoman said.

The midfielder was pictured raising his index fingers apparently in the direction of the match referee who had moments earlier sent off Portugal defender Pepe.

Portugal's football association was quoted in newspapers as saying Meireles made the gesture to explain tactics with a team mate and it was not aimed at the referee.

660,"PORTO ALEGRE Brazil A World Cup that has delivered fantastic goals in the first round of group games has also produced gems away from the pitch with players and coaches coming up with memorable quotes.

Croatia coach Niko Kovac got the tournament off to a fiery start by blasting the Japanese referee after their defeat by Brazil in the opening match.

After the hosts were awarded a penalty when forward Fred theatrically fell to the ground, angry Kovac told reporters: ""This was ridiculous today, and if we continue in this way we will have a circus.

""If that's a penalty, we don't need to play football any more. Let's play basketball instead.

""The lads played their hearts out but that was outright thuggery by a referee who was just out of his depth for a game of this magnitude.""

""Pressure? What pressure?"" seemed to be a common thread running through the interview rooms from the tropical heat of Manaus in the north of Brazil to the rain and chill of Porto Alegre in the south.

The World Cup may be sport's ultimate pressure cooker but fancied Belgium seem to be taking everything in their stride with coach Marc Wilmots putting things into perspective.

""Pressure, you know, it is worse if you have a child who's ill and in hospital,"" he said discussing their status as dark horses. ""That's pressure. Here there is no pressure.""

Different coaches have brought different styles to Brazil and while Spain's Vicente Del Bosque gets the most out of his players through encouragement and praise, Fabio Capello, the Italian coach of Russia, rules by fear and intimidation.

""He is tough and demanding. Discipline is the most important thing for him,"" Russian midfielder Oleg Shatov said of Capello. ""If a player is standing in the defensive wall and turns around, he'll say, 'I will not tolerate that in my teams.

""If you say you're scared, you can leave and I'll use another player'.""

NO FEAR

Germany, one of the favourites to triumph in Brazil, are clearly not afraid of facing anyone after their 4-0 demolition of Portugal.

Instead they are striking fear into their opponents, especially through Thomas Mueller, who scored a hat-trick against the Portuguese.

""In the last four years I've had some experience in world soccer and I'm not the kind of guy who gets afraid,"" said Mueller.

Portugal's Critsiano Ronaldo, who is always full of confidence, says he has nothing to prove at the finals.

Asked if a great World Cup was something lacking in his career, he replied: ""I don't think I have to show anyone anything. If you look at my statistics and my resume...I have no words for that question.

""I think I do not have to demonstrate anything, not now, before, not after. What I have to do is just continue my career, which has been great so far.""

Netherlands forward Arjen Robben, who scored twice against Spain, is also capable of giving the opposition the jitters.

The brace put to bed the trauma of a missed chance in the final four years ago in South Africa when the outstretched leg of Spain keeper Iker Casillas denied the winger a possible World Cup-winning goal.

The only surprise Robben has had in Brazil so far came at a post-match news conference.

Asked about his miss in the 2010 showpiece, he joked: ""I’m surprised it took five questions before it came up. Of course it will stay with me for the rest of my life, you can’t deny that.

""But we are now looking ahead. That all doesn’t count anymore.""

BRASILIA As ever, the referees and their assistants have been centre stage at the World Cup for both good and bad decisions.

The introduction of goalline technology may have helped make the right one for France in their 3-0 Group E win over Honduras but elsewhere debate has raged amid controversial calls.

Here are the five key refereeing decisions after the first round of group matches in Brazil.

1) Brazil striker Fred wins penalty v Croatia

The opening match was evenly poised at 1-1 in the 69th minute when Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura awarded a penalty for the hosts after Brazil striker Fred hit the floor in theatrical fashion following slight contact from Dejan Lovren.

Neymar stroked home the penalty as Brazil went on to claim all three points with Fred denying accusations he dived as he received the ball with his back to goal with Lovren closely marshalling him.

FIFA's head of refereeing Massimo Busacca defended the official's decision after Croatia coach Niko Kovac said the Japanese was ""out of his depth"" and warned the World Cup could turn into a circus.

""The referee was in a very good position. If you make contact you permit the referee to go in one direction,"" the Swiss said.

2) Disallowed Croatian goal v Brazil.

Already unpopular with the Croatians after awarding a penalty to Fred, Nishimura enraged them further by ruling out what would have been an equalising goal in the 83rd minute of their Group A clash.

Croatia forward Ivica Olic was ruled to have fouled goalkeeper Julio Cesar as they jumped for the ball which then ended up in the Brazil net as play continued.

The hosts went on to add inflict further misery on the Croats with Oscar scoring in the final stages to complete a 3-1 win.

3) Ravshan plays key advantage in dramatic Swiss winner

Ravshan Irmatov had been guilty of not letting the play flow during the Group E clash between Ecuador and Switzerland but the Uzbek official rectified that with a crucial advantage as the Europeans snatched a dramatic win in the 93rd minute.

Valon Behrami made a vital block tackle in his own area but as he broke towards goal he was taken out by an Ecuadorean. Irmatov, though, allowed play to carry on as Behrami quickly got back to his feet and continued the move which ended with Haris Seferovic slotting the ball home for a 2-1 win.

4) Australia rightfully denied equaliser v Chile.

Australia looked in danger of being blown away as they quickly fell 2-0 down to Chile in their Group B match-up but Tim Cahill cut the deficit with a trademark header.

The experienced forward then had Socceroos' fans on their feet after another header found the back of the net and he reeled off to celebrate what he thought was the equalising goal.

But his cheers were cut short as the eagle-eyed assistant had noticed he had strayed marginally offside before the cross came in from the right. The South Americans regained their composure and sealed a 3-1 win late on after Jean Beausejour's strike.

5) France ease to win after penalty and red card for Honduran

France were on top in their Group E opener against a physical Honduras but could not find a way through before the Central American's robust approach cost them a goal and player.

Wilson Palacios charged into French midfielder Paul Pogba seconds before the break in a reckless challenge and was sent off for a second booking. Karim Benzema converted the resulting penalty and France ran out comfortable 3-0 winners.

Brazilian referee Sandro Ricci's decision to send off Palacios showed his Honduran team mates that further rough tactics would not be tolerated.

Lewis Hamilton is ready to take an unfamiliar bull by the horns this weekend as Austria's revamped Red Bull Ring returns to the Formula One calendar after an 11-year absence.

The Mercedes driver, a teenager when Austria last hosted a grand prix in 2003, needs to win at Spielberg to rein in championship-leading team mate Nico Rosberg after the blow of retirement in Canada 10 days ago.

""I've never driven the circuit but I've been working on it in the simulator and I'm sure I'll learn it pretty quickly when we get out on track,"" the 2008 world champion said in a team preview.

""It's always exciting to go to a new venue, so it should be an interesting weekend. I'm feeling good in the car right now and I'll be pushing flat out to come away with maximum points this time around.""

With Rosberg finishing first or second in every race so far this season, while Hamilton has retired twice, the German now has a 22-point lead as the championship arrives at Red Bull's home track for the eighth race of 19 this year.

Hamilton may have to win another four races in a row, as he did earlier in the year, just to regain the upper hand if Rosberg stays that consistent.

""There is a long, long way to go. I caught up before and I'll catch up again,"" said the Briton, who started the season with a retirement in Australia that left him 25 points adrift.

""It's going to take another four wins to make the difference so I'm going to do my best to get those results.""

Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff was not discounting that possibility.

""Obviously, Nico now holds an increased gap at the top of the championship but Lewis is a fighter and I have no doubt that he will come back stronger than ever,"" he said.

HOME RACE

Mercedes have been dominant this season but Austrian-owned Red Bull broke their winning streak in Canada when Australian Daniel Ricciardo took his first F1 victory ahead of what amounts to a home race for the team.

The short but scenic track, in the southern Styrian mountains, remains largely the same as the old A1 Ring and is set to be a big celebration of motorsport in Austria with every living Austrian F1 driver taking part in a legends parade.

How much of a celebration it will be for Red Bull remains to be seen.

""We're going to have a lot of home support. There's still a gap to Mercedes, we are working on closing that down,"" team principal Christian Horner said after Montreal.

""To have a race at the Red Bull Ring as Red Bull Racing - with that comes a bit of pressure but it will be fantastic to perform in front of effectively a home crowd.""

Quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel has driven the circuit on a number of occasions but only four current drivers - Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen - have raced there in Formula One.

None have won and only Raikkonen has stood on the podium.

The last winner at the track was Michael Schumacher, the seven times world champion who is now in hospital in Switzerland after recently emerging from a coma following a ski accident at the end of last year.

Schumacher also had one of the most controversial wins of his career at the circuit in 2002 when Brazilian team mate Rubens Barrichello was ordered to let him pass despite dominating the race.

Of the newcomers, McLaren's Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen and Toro Rosso's Russian newcomer Daniil Kvyat are those with the freshest experience having raced there last year in the Renault 3.5 World Series and Formula Three respectively.

""It's a very cool place - it's a circuit where you never really get to rest in the cockpit because the track is always going somewhere,"" said Magnussen.

""Every lap is a real adrenaline rush because the corners never stop coming.""

WINS

Daniel Ricciardo's win for Red Bull in Canada ended Mercedes's run of six victories in a row - the longest streak at the start of a season since McLaren chalked up 11 in a row in 1988. Red Bull won the last nine of 2013.

Ricciardo is the fourth Australian to have won a grand prix, the others being Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and Mark Webber.

The Red Bull driver is the first new grand prix winner since Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado for Williams in Spain in 2012, and the 105th since the world championship started in 1950.

Red Bull's quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel has 39 career wins, Fernando Alonso 32, Lewis Hamilton 26, Kimi Raikkonen 20 and Jenson Button 15. Championship leader Nico Rosberg has five.

Ferrari have won 221 races, McLaren 182, Williams 114 and Red Bull 47.

McLaren have not won for 26 races, a run that dates back to Brazil 2012.

Ferrari's last victory was in Spain in May 2013 - the last time a team other than Mercedes or Red Bull won.

- -

POLE POSITION

Mercedes - with Hamilton (Australia/Malaysia/China/Spain) and Rosberg (Bahrain/Monaco/Canada) - have started every race on pole.

The last team to start the first eight races of a season on pole was Red Bull in 2011.

Vettel took nine poles last year, and now has 45 for his F1 career.

Hamilton now has 35 poles, more than any other British driver in the history of Formula One.

Ferrari's last pole position was in Germany with Fernando Alonso in 2012.

The last time a team other than Mercedes or Red Bull started on pole was in Brazil in November 2012, when Hamilton was fastest in qualifying for McLaren.

- -

POINTS

Caterham, who came into the sport in 2010, are the only team on the grid who have yet to score a point.

Ferrari have finished a record 74 successive races with at least one car in the points, a run that dates back to the 2010 German Grand Prix.

Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat is Formula One's youngest point scorer aged 19 years and 324 days.

AUSTRIA

The circuit is one of the shortest on the calendar, with just nine corners, and last hosted Formula One in 2003.

In 2002, the race triggered uproar and made headlines around the world when Ferrari ordered Rubens Barrichello to hand victory to team mate Michael Schumacher.

Austria first hosted a race at Zeltweg in 1964, with Italian Lorenzo Bandini taking his one and only career win there for Ferrari.

The next race at the renovated Oesterreichring was in 1970, the year that Austrian Jochen Rindt became Formula One's first and only posthumous champion after a fatal accident at Monza.

Triple champion Niki Lauda is the only Austrian to have won his home race, doing so in 1984 with McLaren. There are no Austrian drivers currently on the grid.

Vittorio Brambilla's win in 1975 stood out as the Italian crashed as soon as he took the chequered flag in a rain-shortened race.

Austria disappeared from the calendar between 1987 and 1997, when the circuit was named the A1 Ring. Now owned by Red Bull, who have completely renovated the facility.

Only four current drivers have raced in F1 in Austria - Button, Alonso, Raikkonen and Felipe Massa. None have won the race and Raikkonen is the only one to have stood on the podium.

McLaren have the best record in Austria over the years, with six wins. Ferrari have five.

As Germans celebrated a 4-0 World Cup win over Portugal and welcome news regarding the health of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher, one major sports story appears to have gone largely unnoticed - a first U.S. Open golf title.

Martin Kaymer's eight-stroke victory in North Carolina on Sunday was greeted with widespread praise within golfing circles, but the 29-year-old's runaway triumph barely registered in soccer-mad Germany as the World Cup kicked off in Brazil.

""I feel nothing about his win... no sorrow, no happiness,"" said Berlin accountancy firm employee Anne Ihle, adding that Kaymer's victory had been ""buried"" in an avalanche of news about Germany's bid to end an 18-year football title drought.

It was ""bad timing"", said Christian Hansel, a 38-year-old product manager. He was not a golf fan but did remember Bernhard Langer, who along with Kaymer is the only other German to have won two majors, with Masters titles in 1985 and 1993.

The top-selling German daily Bild, which runs a ""winner"" and ""loser"" column on its front page, put Kaymer in both categories on Tuesday, remarking that ""Germans are only talking about the Schumi-wonder and the start of the team's World Cup bid"".

On Monday, seven times Formula One champion Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident last year, had come out of a coma and was transferred to a Swiss medical centre, officials said, without giving details of his condition.

RETURN TO FORM

Despite the other big stories, the German golfing community did pay attention to Kaymer's win, according to Timo Schlitz, who covers the sport on the Golf.de website, telling Reuters that traffic rose substantially during the U.S. Open.

German Golf Association chairman Marcus Neumann added that the lack of media attention would not diminish the scintillating return to form for Kaymer, whose rise to the number one ranking after winning the 2010 PGA Championship proved short-lived.

""For the golfing world itself, it doesn't matter; for Kaymer it doesn't matter. He will pass into golf history and in a few years nobody will talk about it coinciding with the World Cup,"" Neumann told Reuters.

He believed that Kaymer - who himself wanted to be a professional football player - would be rooting for his friends on the German squad, like Bastian Schweinsteiger, who sat out Monday's game, and Lukas Podolski, who tweeted about Kaymer's ""legendary performance"" just before the match against Portugal.

Kaymer is due to play at the BMW International Open in Cologne next week and despite the tournament taking place during the World Cup, Neumann still expects to see an increase in public and media interest thanks to his U.S. Open victory.

""The parking lots in Cologne are going to be crowded with spectators,"" Neumann said.

670,"PARIS/LAUSANNE Seven times Formula One racing champion Michael Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a ski accident last year, has come out of a coma and was transferred to a Swiss medical centre on Monday, officials said, but gave no details of his condition.

Schumacher, the most successful Formula One racer of all time, has had several brain operations since his accident in the French Alps in late December. He was moved for further treatment early on Monday to Lausanne's CHUV hospital, a sprawling modern glass-fronted complex above Lake Geneva.

The centre treated former Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko for cancer in the mid-1990s and last year its forensic scientists analysed the remains of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for traces of poison.

Schumacher, hugely popular in his native Germany and across the world in a sport that had become immensely lucrative in the course of his career, has been regularly visited at his bedside by his wife Corinna.

Doctors reported in April that he was showing signs of waking from a coma artificially induced to limit any brain damage.

LONG RECOVERY

He slammed his head against a rock while skiing off-piste over the Christmas holidays near their chalet at Meribel in the French Alps, about two hours from their home along Lake Geneva.

""Michael has left the CHU Grenoble (hospital, in France) to continue his long phase of rehabilitation. He is not in a coma anymore,"" spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said in a statement.

Lausanne hospital spokesman Darcy Christen confirmed Schumacher had been admitted but declined to say what unit he was being treated in, citing medical secrecy and family privacy.

Professor Simone Di Giovanni, an expert in restorative neuroscience at Imperial College London, said it was very difficult to predict recovery in people emerging from a coma.

""That can range from someone who merely opens their eyes and may be able to respond to verbal input, to someone who opens their eyes and moves their hands in response to painful input, to someone who interacts with their environment fully and uses language and maybe can have a simple conversation,"" he said.

""In this case, nobody - with the exclusion of the doctors who are treating Michael Schumacher - knows exactly what the condition of the patient is.""

He added however, that rehabilitation would be almost certain to improve Schumacher's clinical condition, whatever that might be, over the coming weeks and months.

Schumacher, 45, won a record 91 Grand Prix victories before retiring in 2006. He made a brief comeback with Mercedes but finally stopped racing last year.

Audi won the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race for the 13th time on Sunday in a one-two finish after a battle through the night with the factory Porsche and Toyota teams.

Switzerland's Marcel Fassler, Frenchman Benoit Treluyer and Germany's Andre Lotterer took the victory in the number two car ahead of the number one driven by Denmark's Tom Kristensen, Spaniard Marc Gene and Brazilian Lucas Di Grassi.

Toyota took third place with Britain's Anthony Davidson, Frenchman Nicolas Lapierre and Swiss driver Sebastien Buemi.

Tom Kristensen's bid for a record-extending 10th victory at the Le Mans 24-hours race suffered a body blow as Porsche capitalised on Audi's turbocharger problems to snatch the lead on Sunday.

The number one Audi driven by Denmark's Kristensen, Lucas di Grassi and Marc Gene had inherited top spot 16 hours into the race when its sister car was called into the garage with a similar issue.

With less than three hours remaining in the race at the Sarthe circuit in western France, the leading Audi pitted to have its turbocharger changed.

The 17 minutes lost in the process gifted the lead to the Porsche Timo Bernhard is sharing with Brendon Hartley and former Formula One driver Mark Webber, who had completed a quadruple stint.

The second Audi of Andre Lotterer moved up to second and was a minute behind the new leader, while Toyota ran a distant fourth following an accident in rain in the early phase of the race.

The Porsche had made the early running in the race, setting the pace ahead of the leading Toyota that had Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin at the wheel as intermittent showers caused a spate of minor accidents during the first four hours of action.

680,"LONDON, June 18 Briton Andy Murray will be seeded third when he attempts to defend his Wimbledon title, while Novak Djokovic has been installed ahead of world number one Rafael Nadal as top seed for the grass-court major.

Murray became the first Briton to win the men's singles title since 1936 when he beat Serbian Djokovic in straight sets last July, and has been seeded two spots above his world ranking for the tournament starting on Monday.

Seven-times champion Roger Federer of Switzerland was named as the fourth seed, meaning neither he nor Djokovic, Nadal or Murray can face each other before the semi-finals.

Spaniard Nadal, winner in 2008 and 2010, claimed a record ninth French Open crown earlier this month but dropped to second seed after failing to make it past the second round at Wimbledon for the past two tournaments.

Wimbledon is the only grand slam that does not automatically follow the men's rankings when seedings are decided. Instead, officials rely on a three-stage formula which, also takes into account grass-court performances of the past two seasons.

Australian Open winner Stan Wawrinka will be seeded fifth despite his world ranking of three, having lost in the first round in 2012 and last year.

Serena Williams is top seed in the women's draw, followed by Li Na and French Open runner-up Simona Halep.

EASTBOURNE, England, June 17 Former world No.1 Victoria Azarenka made a disappointing return from injury when she lost to plucky Italian Camila Giorgi 4-6 6-3 7-5 in the first round of the Aegon International grasscourt tournament on Tuesday.

Playing only her second match since her quarter-final loss in the Australian Open in January because of a persistent foot injury, the fourth-seeded Belarusian showed her usual grit but looked rusty as she was bundled out of the Wimbledon warm-up event on England's south coast.

The twice Australian Open champion had hoped to gain some match practice on grass ahead of next week's Wimbledon with a wildcard entry in Eastbourne but came up against an inspired Giorgi and joined several top seeds to lose early.

Azarenka, whose only other match since the Australian Open was in March at Indian Wells, battled back from 4-2 down to win the first set but quickly tired against her aggressive opponent.

The Italian seized the initiative and the second set, and after winning an epic game to move 6-5 ahead in the third she secured an unforeseen, if not surprising, three-set victory.

Despite defeat Azarenka said the two hours and 47 minutes spent on court had not been in vain.

""That's exactly what I wanted,"" she told a news conference. ""I wanted to have a competitive match, I wanted to test myself and play for a long time and see how my body is going to react.

""It was the most important thing for today that I was there playing and I was healthy and that's great news.

""I can only get better from here.""

Azarenka's defeat was among some notable exits in the first round of the women's draw, with another former world No.1 and third seed Jelena Jankovic losing in straight sets to American Madison Keys later in the day, following top seed Agnieszka Radwanska's loss on Monday.

684,"CAPE TOWN, June 18 Victor Matfield will become the most-capped South African player of all time when the giant lock leads the Springboks in the second test against Wales in Nelspruit on Saturday.

When he takes to the pitch, the 37-year-old will beak the record of 2007 World Cup-winning skipper John Smit with his 112th appearance for the side as South Africa look to wrap up the two-test series with another thumping win.

Matfield will lead a side that has two changes from one that scored five tries in beating the Welsh 38-16 in Durban last weekend.

The first will be a new lock partner in Flip van der Merwe and the other at loose-head prop, where Tendai Mtawarira takes over from Gurthro Steenkamp.

""This is a fantastic accolade for Victor,"" Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer said in a SARU media release on Wednesday.

""He has been a terrific servant of the game in South Africa and has led his country with distinction since returning to the Green and Gold.

""When he returned to the game earlier this season, he set his goals on becoming a Springbok yet again and he's worked extremely hard to get there.

""I don't think anyone can doubt that he deserves his place in the team and he's also been a great interim captain, with Jean de Villiers out injured.""

BOTHA RESTED

Van der Merwe, who was given last weekend off to attend his brother's wedding, will play alongside his Bulls team mate Matfield after Meyer opted to rest veteran Bakkies Botha, who was not even named on the bench.

""I've always preferred to stick with a winning combination and the changes to the team were both part of our planning,"" Meyer added.

""The backline really performed well last weekend and we would like to give them another opportunity to play together, as there were a number of new combinations.

""The same applies up front. Bakkies is fit for selection, but we decided to manage his workload this week and I know Flip, who has been outstanding in the last two seasons, will slot back in easily.

""The same goes for 'Beast' (Mtawarira), who upped the tempo with his work rate last weekend.""

* Cipriani puts in solid performance at flyhalf (Adds quotes)

June 17 England's fringe test players proved to coach Stuart Lancaster he was on the right track to build depth as he prepares for next year's World Cup with a 38-7 victory over the seven-times Super Rugby champion Canterbury Crusaders in Christchurch on Tuesday.

The visitors, who have spent most of the tour holding tackle bags for the test side, scored six tries - four in the first half - while flyhalf Danny Cipriani slotted three conversions before he was substituted early in the second half.

Crusaders' flanker Matt Todd, who replaced captain George Whitelock when he suffered a head knock in the first half, scored his side's only try, which was converted by Tom Taylor.

""I was pleased for all 23 lads. I was desperate for them to do well because they have worked hard for us,"" Lancaster said in a televised interview.

""They were patient and waited for their opportunity and I was hoping they would put in a performance that would make them proud and I thought they delivered that.

""I keep coming back to the bigger picture and what we're trying to do and get the squad ready for a World Cup in 12 months time and today was a great marker for us.""

England showed a willingness to spread the ball wide and play the game at pace, while their forwards' superior size and the team's rush defensive system put pressure on the Crusaders and forced them into errors and turnovers.

They scored four tries in the first half to hooker Joe Gray, winger Ben Foden, inside centre Brad Barritt and fullback Alex Goode, with Cipriani converting three to go into the break with a handy 26-7 lead.

The match descended into an arm-wrestle in the second half with England winger Anthony Watson's try in the 59th minute the only scoring action before replacement Chris Pennell scored the sixth and final try after the fulltime hooter.

It was England's first win on the tour after they lost the first two matches to the All Blacks and will no doubt give the test side hope ahead of the third and final match in Hamilton on Saturday.

Skelton will make his test debut against France in the dead rubber third test in Sydney on Saturday, one of two changes to the Wallabies' starting side from the 6-0 win over Les Bleus in Melbourne.

In a sign of Skelton's standing, the much-touted 22-year-old has displaced former captain James Horwill, a 50-test veteran.

McKenzie paid him a greater compliment on Tuesday, comparing him to the highly skilled forwards running for the All Blacks.

""Everyone talks about his size but I've been more impressed by the skill touches,"" McKenzie told reporters in Sydney.

""I've said for years now the thing that's defined the All Blacks is the forwards' contribution to passing in the game.

""You'll find that the All Blacks, their forwards might make up to 25 percent of the passing in the game. Most other countries are around the 12 percent mark.

""So having forwards who can create opportunities creates lots of diversity in the game.""

BLEDISLOE TILT

After attempting to sweep the French 3-0 on Saturday, the Wallabies head back to their Super Rugby clubs to finish the season before bracing for another tilt at winning back the Bledisloe Cup - the annual trophy contested with New Zealand.

Eleven years in New Zealand hands, re-capturing the Bledisloe has become a Holy Grail-like mission for the Wallabies, with the task seemingly becoming more difficult with each passing year.

Australia lost all three tests to the world champion All Blacks last year, their opponents literally unbeatable as they completed a perfect season.

Long short of big locks, Australia will now blood a third in three tests, with ACT Brumbies' Sam Carter having started the first match in Brisbane and Western Force's Nathan Charles coming off the bench in Melbourne, which made him the first player suffering cystic fibrosis to play an international.

""It's easy to crash the ball up,"" McKenzie said.

""It's knowing when to do that and when to create opportunities for someone else and I've seen (Skelton) do that a number of times this year and that's the thing that has impressed me the most.

""I've been really impressed with his attitude and the contribution he's made to this team since the beginning of the series.

""He's obviously got impressive metrics but he also has a big motor and is particularly skillful, so we're looking forward to seeing how he will impose himself on the game.""

Skelton's promotion sees Horwill relegated to the bench again, having regained a starting spot in the wake of Carter's series-ending injury.

Wycliff Palu returns from a minor ankle injury to number eight after missing the second test in Melbourne, replacing Western Force backrower Ben McCalman.

Australia wrapped up the series with a dour 6-0 win at Docklands Stadium on Saturday which triggered a hail of criticism for the stodgy, territorial game the home side executed.

McKenzie has resisted shaking up the backline which failed to score a try in Melbourne, leaving utility back Kurtley Beale on the bench and sticking with the halves combination of Bernard Foley and Nic White.

Though unapologetic about Saturday's ugly win, McKenzie defended his record.

""You're always working towards that complete game where you find the balance between your intentions in attack and an impenetrable defence,"" he said.

""Our desire is to always play an up-tempo brand of rugby and we've now scored 23 tries in the past six games, an average of almost four a game.

""Our defence has also been steadily improving with each match, culminating with a shut-out of the French in our most recent match in Melbourne.

""The challenge and what we are always aiming for is to put both together and that will be our goal when we return to afternoon rugby in Sydney on Saturday.""

Bidding for their seventh successive win, the Wallabies have made two further changes to the bench, with Rob Horne coming in for fellow centre Pat McCabe and prop Scott Sio replacing Pek Cowan.

MADRID Many Spaniards are hoping for a lot more than polish and glamour from new King Felipe VI when he takes the throne on Thursday after his father's surprise abdication.

The new monarch faces daunting expectations that he can help resolve some thorny political problems - especially a surging independence movement in wealthy Catalonia in northeastern Spain - even though his role as head of state is largely symbolic.

Part of this is because the 46-year-old, who has a degree in diplomacy from Washington D.C.'s Georgetown University and is married to a television journalist, is widely popular.

He also has an untainted image that contrasts with that of his father and other members of his family.

But some constitutional experts and politicians are hoping the new king will use behind-the-scenes influence to push Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and opposition leaders into reforming Spain's 1978 constitution to resolve the Catalan crisis by redesigning relations between autonomous regions and the central government.

""The new king could push in some way a constitutional reform to help to legitimize the monarchy more fully,"" said Joaquin Tornos, a law professor at the University of Barcelona.

Felipe - whose father King Juan Carlos lost favor after going on a secret elephant hunting trip at the height of Spain's financial crisis in 2012 - could use gestures, conversations and consultations to push dialogue, Tornos said.

As constitutional monarch, he is seen as the only player who could break a stand off between Catalan leader Artur Mas - who vows to hold a vote on independence in November - and Rajoy, who pledges to block the vote.

Mas has tapped into a growing Catalan independence mood fueled by a long recession and perceptions of unfair taxation.

It cannot hurt that Felipe has studied Catalan - the language spoken by 7 million people in northeastern Spain - setting him apart from most of the Spanish-speaking Madrid-based ruling class.

""He can function as a moderator or arbitrator to help a new consensus emerge on a possible constitutional reform, which is very necessary and which I believe should be profound,"" said Gregorio Camara, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Granada, who led a team that drafted a white paper on constitutional reform last year for opposition Socialists.

NEW CONSTITUTION?

Spain's 1978 constitution was the fruit of a delicate consensus on stability after the long dictatorship that followed the brutal civil war of the 1930s.

After the 1975 death of General Francisco Franco, Spain's polarized leaders agreed to a constitutional monarchy to mollify rightists. They also created 17 autonomous regions with a promise of significant devolution for the separatist-minded Basques and for Catalonia.Thirty-six years later, the consensus has crumbled, undermined by economic hard times and high-level corruption.

Criminal charges against Felipe's brother-in-law - accused of embezzling millions of euros of public funds - were a major factor in King Juan Carlos' stepping down. Separately, a former ruling People's Party (PP) treasurer is in jail on bribery, money-laundering and other charges.

Still reeling from the euro zone crisis and battered by crippling unemployment, Spaniards are in a feisty mood.

A recent poll showed that most now say they would like to vote on whether they have a monarchy; many Catalans and Basques feel the promise of self-rule was a cruel hoax as the central government has balked at further devolution; and the Socialists and centre-right PP who have shared power for decades have hit historic lows with voters.Emerging leaders from the left are calling for a complete overhaul at a constitutional convention followed by ratification in a freshly elected Parliament and a people's referendum.

""The consensus of '78, of the transition, doesn't work any more. The media, the political parties, the unions, the judges, the monarchy, none of it works,"" said Juan Carlos Monedero, spokesman for Podemos, a new leftist political party that took a surprise 8 percent of the vote in the May 25 European election.

The beleaguered Socialists - haemorrhaging voters and struggling to renew their discredited leadership - have also embraced constitutional reform.

In the white paper led by Camara last year, Socialists argued a new constitution should change Spain's territorial model into a federal state that explicitly recognises the historical, cultural and linguistic differences of Catalonia, the Basque country and Galicia.

The idea is to address weaknesses in the 1978 Constitution, which critics say diluted self-rule for Catalonia and the Basques by trying to treat all 17 autonomous regions equally, even those with no historical quest for nationhood.

It also proposes making the Senate - one of Spain's most criticized institutions - into a body that represents the interests of 17 regions - another way to address Catalonia's grievances.

NOT THE ANSWER

Few in the ruling People's Party, however, support constitutional reform and many question how far the king can play a negotiating role given the limitations on his power.

""The important thing would be to rebuild a wider consensus, a political accord, between the PP and the Socialists, rather than destroy the constitutional architecture,"" said Javier Zarzalejos, head of the conservative FAES think tank.

Others argue that the PP and Socialists could agree minor changes to the constitution and pass them through Parliament as they did in 2011, for example, to put a deficit ceiling into the constitution at the height of the fiscal crisis.

Rajoy is resisting debate on reform. Officials close to him say his view is that a new constitution wouldn't satisfy Catalans who want to secede. They say the prime minister believes Spain is already so highly decentralized - under a series of pacts the central government has with each region - that a constitutional reform could even lead to less devolution.

NATAL Brazil Americans are starting to get a little rowdy at the World Cup in Brazil and that's just dandy for fans whose devotion highlights a growing football culture in a nation slow to embrace the world's most popular game.

Whether they call it football or soccer, U.S. supporters reveling in Monday's 2-1 win against Ghana are helping foster the kind of tribal and community ties that make the sport, and especially the World Cup, an indispensable event for many nations across the globe.

Guy Cross, an American born to an English father, has long supported the U.S. national team but said in the early days going to a game was a frustrating experience for someone used to a livelier atmosphere.

""I remember France in 1998 and sitting in the stands where people didn't know any songs,"" said Cross. ""They couldn't even sing Yankee Doodle Dandy.

""But it's definitely evolved over the last 20 years. The support is more intense and broader and people are more knowledgeable about the game.""

Ahead of the U.S. opening match against Ghana in Natal, face-painted and flag-waving fans gathered at a local pizzeria near the stadium.

The dress code ranged from traditional team kit to super-hero chic to creative uses of an American flag as hundreds of boisterous fans balanced their beers and took turns batting a beach ball around a large hall.

Jordan Armstrong, 32, ready for the game dressed as the Duff Beer man from the Simpson's, said he sees a growing commitment from U.S. supporters who have adopted traditions from home and abroad to fuel a burgeoning soccer culture.

""This wasn't given to us as fandom by our parents,"" he said. ""Hopefully we are the generation that can pass this on.

""Other countries have a century plus history of football culture. We have something like 15 years.""

The increasing passion of U.S. fans has mirrored growth of the game at home, where it competes for attention with the established sports of American Football, ice hockey and basketball.

More than 13 million Americans play soccer while Major League Soccer (MLS) stadiums average around 18,000 supporters for each game -- more than the professional leagues of many traditional footballing nations.

Many Americans are also now as dedicated as their foreign counterparts, flying across the globe to follow their team from qualification games to the World Cup as did Korey Donahoo who attended six of the 10 U.S. matches on the road to Brazil.

MELTING POT

The 31-year-old founder of the American Outlaws supporters group, which with around 20,000 members is one of the U.S. soccer team's biggest, said a real culture is evolving as American aficionados adopt chants and traditions from other countries and sports.

""Just like America it's a melting pot of different things,"" Donahoo said.

""We jump around in our section at national games like students do at a university basketball game and we have things like drums in South American countries and chants from European countries.""

Supporters agree that what defines U.S. soccer culture is a positive attitude both toward the team and for fellow and opposing fans.

When Ghana equalized against the United States in their World Cup opener, American supporters continued to roar their support and chanted ""We believe, we believe, we believe, we will win"" until the whistle blew to end the game.

704,"The mayor of the wealthy Southern California city of San Marino, who has been dogged by security camera images purporting to show him toss a bag of canine feces on to his neighbor's property, has resigned, media reported.

After Mayor Dennis Kneier's neighbor on June 7 found the small bag outside his home he reviewed his surveillance footage and notified police, who later cited the politician for littering, police and media said.

The video went viral and drew community anger after the neighbor shared it publicly. Kneier has apologized.

""These events continue to be embarrassing to me, and to the city,"" Kneier wrote in a letter to fellow City Council members announcing his resignation on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported. ""Because of this, I have decided to step down as mayor.""

Kneier did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The neighbor, Philip Lao, was reported to have suggested Kneier was responding to a ""No Poop Zone"" sign outside his home as well as his public opposition to a proposed area dog park, the Times reported.

Vice Mayor Eugene Sun will take over until the council members select a new mayor, the Times reported. Kneier, whose term ends in November 2015, will remain on the council.

706,"SALT LAKE CITY Organizers of an Oktoberfest celebration at a Utah ski resort have won a reprieve and will able to put stronger beers back on the menu after state regulators agreed to rework stringent rules for one-time event liquor licenses.

Critics scoffed when the state's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC) told the Snowbird resort last month it might not be granted a permit to serve higher-alcohol beer, wine or spirits during the German-style fall festival.

State Senator Jim Dabakis, a Salt Lake City Democrat, said the department had turned Utah in a national ""laughingstock,"" and lawmakers summoned DABC Director Sal Petilos on Monday to give its Administrative Rules Review Committee an explanation.

Petilos said officials were following guidelines for single-event licenses that favor civic or non-profit groups over for-profit events. But he said that in this case, permit rules would be reworked and input taken from businesses and the public.

Lack of a single-event permit would have stopped Oktoberfest from selling beer or any other drink with an alcohol content greater than 4 percent by weight or 3.2 percent by volume.

Conservative Utah is well-known for its strict and complex liquor laws. Snowbird already has 19 liquor licenses for its bars and restaurants but none that would allow for the sale of stronger brews at the outdoor event, which is held over several weekends.

NEW YORK A British Guiana One-Cent Magenta postage stamp from 1856, the only one of its kind to still exist, sold for a record $9.5 million at Sotheby's on Tuesday.

The hefty price, which includes the buyer's premium, makes the one-inch by one-and-a-quarter-inch stamp (2.5 cm by 3.2 cm) printed in black on magenta paper the most expensive stamp ever sold at auction, and the most valuable object by weight and size, according to the auction house.

An anonymous telephone bidder purchased the stamp during the bidding in the packed auction.

""Every time it has come up for auction and sold, it has brought the highest price ever paid for a stamp,"" said David Redden, the worldwide chairman of books and manuscripts at Sotheby's.

""It has always been the world's most-famous stamp. It is one of these objects around which a huge mystique has grown up over the years,"" he said.

The previous record auction price for a single stamp was 2.87 million Swiss francs (about $2.2 million). It was set in 1996 for the Treskilling Yellow, a Swedish stamp that is a misprint of an 1855 shilling stamp in the wrong color.

The British Guiana stamp was sold by the estate of the late multimillionaire John du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune, who died in prison in 2010 at the age of 72. Du Pont was serving a murder sentence for the shooting of David Schultz, a champion U.S. wrestler, in 1996.

Earlier this year, the Royal Philatelic Society of London re-authenticated the stamp, which du Pont, an avid stamp collector, purchased in 1980 for $935,000. The stamp's authenticity was previously verified in 1935.

The British Guiana One-Cent Magenta is one of the world's first postage stamps. In 1856 in British Guiana - now the republic of Guyana - the local postmaster asked a newspaper to print some stamps after supplies from Britain, where its stamps were printed, were delayed.

There are still a few four-cent stamps issued by the South American country, but this is the only one-cent. Until this year, the stamp had not been on public view since 1987, according to Sotheby's.

The stamp was discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old schoolboy named L. Vernon Vaughan, who was living in British Guiana with his family. He found it among his family papers.

He kept it in his collection and later sold it to another collector in British Guiana. It surfaced in Britain in 1878 and was then purchased by Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, a noted stamp collector.

The count's collection was donated to the postal museum in Berlin and was later seized by France as war reparation from Germany and sold in 1922.

It was sold several times before du Pont purchased it. Part of the proceeds of the sale will go to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Conservation Foundation, which du Pont supported.

SAO PAULO Neymar likes them Brazil-green. England's Wayne Rooney, white. Luis Suarez, blue.

Banned from the pitch by FIFA for licensing reasons, the bulky Beats headphones are a favorite for many of the world's top players, making the World Cup a huge unofficial ad for the company acquired by Apple Inc last month.

The colorful high-end headphones created by rapper Dr Dre have become a ubiquitous soccer accessory.

Neymar wore them as he stepped off the bus at the Castelao stadium of Fortaleza for Brazil's last training season on the eve of their match with Mexico on Tuesday.

Suarez had them wrapped around his neck as he joked with his Uruguay team mates during a break at a recent practice.

But soccer world governing body FIFA's licensing agreement with rival electronics maker Sony Corp means players have to take them off when they are in World Cup stadiums for official matches and media events.

Marketing experts say that probably only amplifies their appeal.

""When fans see World Cup athletes wearing Beats in their downtime, by choice, it has as much impact as seeing them lace their Adidas (boots) or sip a sponsored beverage,"" said strategist Ellen Petry Leanse, a former Apple and Google executive.

""Maybe more, actually – Beats isn't a sponsor, so the message is more authentic and credible.""

Acquired by Apple for $3 bln, Beats Electronics is known for ""guerrilla marketing"" tactics to bypass licensing barriers.

During the 2012 Olympics in London, for instance, the company sent thousands of free headphones to high profile athletes including the U.S. basketball team and the entire British delegation, outsmarting official sponsor Panasonic.

Officials at Beats were not available for comment on their strategy at the Olympics and this World Cup.

A five-minute film featuring Neymar, Suarez, Germany's Mario Goetze, Netherlands' Robin van Persie, Mexico's Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez and other players wearing Beats headphones released days before the World Cup has been seen by 10.6 million people on YouTube.

Its name? ""The Game Before the Game"".

Sony this month issued all players participating in the World Cup with a free set of its own headphones they can take to the games.

But so far few players have been spotted with them wrapped around their necks.

712,"KARLSRUHE Germany Germany's highest court of appeal ruled on Tuesday that cyclists who sustain head injuries in an accident are not automatically considered partly responsible if they were not wearing a helmet.

The ruling, which overturned a controversial lower court decision, means cyclists can choose not to wear a helmet without fear of any financial disadvantage in case of a crash.

Helmets are not compulsory in Germany and only 15 percent of cyclists wear them.

The Federal Court of Justice ruling concerned an accident in April 2011, when a 61-year-old woman cycling to work was thrown from her bike when a passenger in a parked car suddenly opened the door as she passed.

The woman suffered serious head injuries and spent months in hospital. The car owner's insurance company claimed she bore some responsibility for her injuries because she wasn't wearing a helmet, and wanted to reduce its payout by 20 percent.

A local court in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein agreed with the insurance company and reasoned that ""a decent and reasonable person would wear a helmet to decrease the risk of injury"". The woman appealed the ruling to the federal court.

The German Cyclists Association (ADFC) welcomed Tuesday's ruling. Its National Director Burkhard Stork said, ""the 30 million people that cycle everyday can decide for themselves if they should wear a helmet or not.""The cyclist lobbying group encourages voluntary helmet wearing. It says the safety benefits of basic bicycle helmets are not as clear as those of seat belts or motorcycle helmets.

Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt agreed, saying: ""Helmets can provide security and reduce injuries in the case of accident... but we want freedom of choice to be the main focus.""

In Berlin, where cyclists with and without helmets dart across the city daily, opinion was mixed. Ludwig Wright, a young helmet-wearing cyclist, said he believed people should be free to decide because compulsory helmet wearing could reduce the number of cyclists, such as he said happened in Australia.

Tabitha Ludek said she opposed a helmet law because it would mess up her hair. ""I don't think you should always have to wear a helmet, especially not for shorter distances,"" she added.

A Swedish company called Hoevding developed an airbag in 2013 to replace the traditional bike helmet in response to just such fashion concerns. The catch: it costs about 300 euros ($410), compared to about 30 to 60 euros for a helmet. ($1 = 0.7345 Euros)

""The important thing would be to rebuild a wider consensus, a political accord, between the PP and the Socialists, rather than destroy the constitutional architecture,"" said Javier Zarzalejos, head of the conservative FAES think tank.

Others argue that the PP and Socialists could agree minor changes to the constitution and pass them through Parliament as they did in 2011, for example, to put a deficit ceiling into the constitution at the height of the fiscal crisis.

Rajoy is resisting debate on reform. Officials close to him say his view is that a new constitution wouldn't satisfy Catalans who want to secede. They say the prime minister believes Spain is already so highly decentralized - under a series of pacts the central government has with each region - that a constitutional reform could even lead to less devolution.

RIO DE JANEIRO Clint Dempsey's opening goal for the United States in their 2-1 win over Ghana has been officially timed at 30 seconds, FIFA said on Tuesday.

The goal in the Group G match in Natal on Monday was initially given as 32 seconds and later 29 seconds.

""Thirty seconds - that is what we have been given by our stats team,"" FIFA spokesperson Delia Fischer told reporters.

The fastest World Cup goal was scored by Hakan Sukur of Turkey after 11 seconds against South Korea in the third-place playoff in 2002.

The three other goals quicker than Dempsey's were scored by Vaclav Masek (16 seconds) for Czechoslovakia against Mexico in 1962, Ernst Lehner for Germany against Austria after 25 seconds in 1934, and Bryan Robson's goal for England against France after 27 seconds in 1982.

NEW YORK The man who took over the Penn State athletic program when it was rocked by child sex abuse charges involving an assistant football coach will retire in August, the university said in a statement on Tuesday.

David Joyner, a Penn State graduate and member of its board of trustees, was named acting athletic director in November 2011, shortly after Jerry Sandusky was charged with sexually abusing boys he met through his charity for disadvantaged children.

Sandusky was convicted the following year on 45 counts of child sex abuse for molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the football team's showers on campus.

Soon after, the NCAA, the organization that regulates U.S. college sports, vacated 14 years worth of victories the team racked up under coach Joe Paterno, among other penalties and fines.

Penn State's current president, Eric Barron, applauded Joyner for providing ""steady leadership to Athletics for nearly three years.""

In a statement, Joyner said: ""The spirit of Penn State is strong and the department's commitment to integrity, as well as academic and athletic excellence, is stronger than ever.""

A previous Penn State athletic director, Tim Curley, is one of three former university officials facing charges he lied to a grand jury by saying they were unaware of a 1998 allegation that Sandusky showered with a boy.

Former Penn State president Graham Spanier and former vice president Gary Schultz are facing similar charges.

The scandal also led to the dismissal of Paterno, one of the most successful coaches in college football. He died in January 2012 of lung cancer at age 85.

720,"MIAMI Miami-Dade County lawmakers agreed on Tuesday to commit tax revenues to the Miami Dolphins football team if it can attract big-ticket events like the NFL's Super Bowl and World Cup soccer matches to its privately owned stadium.

In return, the team agreed to self-finance a $350 million overhaul of its privately owned stadium.

The compromise deal came after the Florida Legislature rejected a previous proposal to use public funds to finance the stadium upgrade.

Local taxpayers soured on publicly financed stadium deals for privately owned sports teams after critics complained about the generous terms of a $500 million park for the Miami Marlins baseball team in 2008, funded largely by tax money.

Local officials recently rebuffed efforts by retired soccer superstar David Beckham to secure publicly owned waterfront land for a 20,000-seat stadium, even though Beckham agreed to finance it privately.

Since the recession, ""people have found it a little distasteful for millionaire players and billionaire owners to get new facilities when police officers and firefighters are losing their jobs,"" said Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts.

Under the deal Miami-Dade County commissioners approved on Tuesday by a 7-4 vote, the Dolphins can receive up to $5 million a year from county tourist taxes if they secure big sporting events, with payments starting in 2024.

The Dolphins hope to host World Cup matches in an upgraded stadium if Qatar is stripped of the 2022 tournament following allegations of corruption in the selection process.

Dolphins owner and billionaire real estate tycoon Stephen Ross said the $350 million overhaul of the nearly 30-year-old Sun Life Stadium, including a roof, more seating and a new Jumbotron, were needed to attract future Super Bowls.

Representatives for the team and the National Football League declined to comment.

Earlier this month, Miami-Dade County reached a deal with the Miami Heat to extend the team's use of a publicly owned arena through 2035. The county raised its tax-funded subsidy by more than $2 million a year after the National Basketball Association team agreed to pay $1 million a year to the county’s parks department.

The United States are full of confidence after a dramatic win over Ghana but coach Juergen Klinsmann remains wary of a Portuguese backlash after the Cristiano Ronaldo-led side were mauled in their World Cup opener by Germany.

A last-gasp 2-1 victory over Ghana showed the United States could keep cool in a big match and they will need to do so again when they take on world player of the year Ronaldo on Sunday.

A win over Portugal in the Group G contest in the jungle city of Manaus should put the Americans through to the last 16 for the fourth time in the last seven tournaments.

However, Klinsmann warned that Portugal's 4-0 thrashing by Germany could jolt them into action and the Americans will have to cope without burly striker Jozy Altidore, who suffered a hamstring injury against Ghana.

There was better news on the fitness of Matt Besler and Clint Dempsey, who Klinsmann said would both be fit for the Portugal game.

""With all the respect we have for the Portuguese team, it’s a very difficult situation for them after their defeat, they are with their backs against the wall,"" Klinsmann said after a training session in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.

""It makes it even more difficult to get a result, but that’s what a World Cup is all about.""

DREADFUL DEFENDING

Poor finishing, dreadful defending and indiscipline combined to make it a miserable opening game for Paulo Bento's Portugal.

Five of their starting lineup against Germany were over 30, including three of the back four, so a more youthful U.S. team will aim to press the Portuguese in the hot and humid climate.

Portugal will also be without defender Pepe, whose red card for leaning into Germany striker Thomas Mueller with his head rules him out.

The match will be the second World Cup meeting between the teams and the United States will hope for a similar result to 2002 in South Korea when they shocked a more fancied Portuguese side 3-2 in the group stage.

Although the United States are no longer surprise packages, they will be without striker Altidore.

""The medical staff is doing a tremendous job, so we still have to hope the Jozy will be back,"" Klinsmann added. ""How quickly? That is down to his healing process.""

While Besler failed to start the second half due to a tight hamstring, Klinsmann said he was ready to go in the second group game.

Dempsey, who suffered a broken nose from taking a boot to the face shortly after scoring the fifth-fastest World Cup goal, will soldier on, perhaps with a mask.

""I don’t know how much a mask can protect you,"" added the German. ""It was tricky during the game, he barely could breathe, he struggled with that, but once it's broken it's broken.

""Unfortunately it's also part of our game.""

Klinsmann said it was important not to dwell on the success of the opening game and to look ahead.

""We only talk now about how we can beat the Portuguese team, with all these amazing players they have,"" he said.

""This is our goal. We believe we can go to Manaus and beat them. We want to get to the next phase and we need to beat Portugal.""

Brazil failed to win for the first time in 11 games with their own lackluster midfield as much to blame for the 0-0 draw with Mexico as the inspired goalkeeping performance of Guillermo Ochoa.

Brazil started Tuesday's World Cup Group A match with a midfield trio of Paulinho, Luiz Gustavo, and Ramires, who started on the right in place of usual starter Hulk. Oscar played slightly further forward between the midfield and attack.

But Ramires was taken off at halftime and Oscar was also substituted before the end, while Paulinho looked out of sorts and was lucky to last the whole 90 minutes in Fortaleza.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said he took Ramires off because ""he's an impetuous player who had a yellow card and we didn't want him getting a red.""

But he cannot have been happy with the way defensive midfielders Luiz Gustavo and Paulinho gave the Mexican attackers far too much space.

The Mexicans let loose with shots from outside the box on several occasions and while most of them flew over they were getting into dangerous positions.

""Brazil need to mark, cut down space and not even let Mexicans think they can take the game to Brazil,"" former Brazil player and TV Globo commentator Casagrande said midway through the second half.

""They're shooting from far out. They've been doing this since the start but they're doing it a lot more in the second half and they are getting a lot of space. The Mexicans are using the space well but Brazil aren't even getting in a position to shoot.""

Scolari agreed and said he was also having trouble convincing his own players to follow suit and let fly with long-range efforts.

""Sometimes we passed instead of shooting,"" Scolari told reporters. ""I tell them they sometimes need to have a go, they need to believe in their shooting.""

With a solid looking defense and the attacking trio of Neymar, Fred and Hulk, who had been nursing a thigh problem, appearing set, Scolari's dilemma ahead of the final Group A match against Cameroon in Brasilia on Monday is who to play in midfield.

Paulinho looks jaded after a disappointing first season in England with Tottenham Hotspur and Luiz Gustavo also struggled to make an impact against the impressive Mexicans.

He may not want to risk Ramires and a second yellow that would lead to a one-match suspension but he will surely be tempted to give a run out to either Willian or Fernandinho, two players whose English Premier League form last season helped them force their way into the squad at the last minute.

726,"NATAL Brazil Juergen Klinsmann extended his perfect record in opening World Cup matches when the United States beat Ghana 2-1 on Monday but after their late winner he was more concerned with the flaws exposed in his team.

Clint Dempsey's early goal gave the U.S. the perfect start and, after Andre Ayew equalized for Ghana, John Brooks powered home an 86th-minute header to grab the win and maintain the coach's 100 percent record in World Cup openers.

The 49-year-old, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990, said his captain's strike, officially timed at 29 seconds after kickoff, had perhaps come too early.

""The whole bench was jumping around,"" he said. ""If you score after just a minute you think there can't be anything better than that.

""After that it maybe wasn't so good because we sat back and let them come to us, that is why I was screaming on the sideline to take control of the game. We had problems controlling the ball and making passes.""

Klinsmann said he always believed the U.S. would win even when Ghana equalized but knows they will have to improve some aspects of their game for the Group G games with Portugal and Germany.

""It was a very enjoyable moment when the goal came, when a late goal like this happens then you see a bench jumping up full of joy and excitement,"" he said.

""(But) the match showed us a lot of areas we have to do better for the second game. We gave too much of the game to Ghana. We will take all those pieces and analyze them and show the players.""

The former Germany striker played in three World Cups, helping his team start the tournament by beating Yugoslavia 4-1 in 1990, Bolivia 1-0 in 1994 and the United States 2-0 in 1998.

Klinsmann also coached Germany to a 4-2 victory over Costa Rica in their first game of the 2006 tournament on home soil.

Goalscorer Dempsey claimed a little bit of tournament history for himself at the Dunas arena, becoming the first American to score at three World Cups.

The 31-year-old ended the contest with a suspected broken nose after taking a blow to the face from a Ghanaian boot but he was not going to get much sympathy from his coach.

""I broke mine three or four times,"" said Klinsmann. ""It's alright. He'll be alright in a few days ...""

NATAL Brazil A 2-1 win against a Ghana side that knocked the United States out of the last two World Cups will mean nothing if the Americans falter in their remaining Group G games, captain Clint Dempsey said on Monday.

The U.S. were beaten by Ghana in their final group stage game in 2006 and in the last 16 four years later.

""It just so happened we had history with Ghana,"" said Dempsey, who scored after 29 seconds on Monday but also suffered a broken nose.

""They pretty much knocked us out of the last two World Cups but this win means nothing unless we build on it.""

The Americans hope they can carry the momentum into their next match with Portugal in Manaus on Sunday before taking on group favorites Germany in Recife as they bid to make the last 16 for the fourth time in the last seven tournaments.

A first step was finally beating Ghana and Dempsey's goal also marked sweet vindication for a player who helped lead the American attack in the two previous defeats against the Black Stars.

In 2006, the U.S. equalized when Dempsey scored late in the first half only for Ghana to convert a penalty minutes later to take a 2-1 lead that would send them through to the knockout rounds and the Americans home.

The Americans again fell behind in their last 16 match in South Africa in 2010 before Landon Donovan equalized from the penalty spot - only for Asamoah Gyan to split the U.S. defense in extra time and lash the winner past Tim Howard.

Despite their early lead on Monday, it looked like Gyan would once again help break American hearts when his sublime backheel set up Andre Ayew's 83rd minute equalizer after intense Ghana pressure.

A powerful header from substitute and World Cup debutant John Brooks three minutes later, however, gave the Americans their first win over their African rivals in three attempts.

""Any team you have beaten twice will come out very strong and I believe they came out very strong and they were determined not to lose a third time,"" Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah said.

Berlin-born John Brooks grabbed an 86th-minute winner for the United States against Ghana in World Cup Group G on Monday as Juergen Klinsmann’s policy of recruiting dual-nationals from Europe paid off.

With Frankfurt-born midfielder Jermaine Jones arguably the best player for the U.S. in their 2-1 victory, dominating in midfield and creating the opening goal for Clint Dempsey, there was a distinctly German flavor to the win.

Although he is unlikely to crow, the victory was vindication for former Germany players and coach Klinsmann.

The U.S. coach has faced criticism for his policy of searching out eligible players in Europe and Mexico to add to the homegrown talent.

Brooks was the hero but another German-American, Fabian Johnson, produced pace and work-rate on the right side and former Iceland Under-21 international Aron Johannsson had to work tirelessly as a lone striker after coming on for the injured Jozy Altidore.

Bruce Arena, who was coach of the U.S. team at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, has been vocal in his criticism of the policy and just before the World Cup also objected to having a non-American like Klinsmann as coach.

There have been others who have questioned whether the German-Americans have the same commitment to the cause as their team mates born on American soil.

The apparent hesitation of players such as Timothy Chandler, who have grown up in the German youth system, to commit fully to the U.S. team before making the decisive decision, added to the doubts.

But Klinsmann has clearly been able to increase his options and strengthen his starting line-up by including the sons of U.S. servicemen who served in Germany as well as Johannsson and Oslo-born midfielder Mix Diskerud.

Speaking after Arena’s criticism last year, Klinsmann defended the policy of seeking out talent outside the borders of the United States.

""The world is changing. It's a global game. I believe Americans are Americans, no matter if they grow up in Japan, South Africa or Buenos Aires,"" he said.

""Our job is to identify the best talents with an American passport and

""For me personally, America is a melting-pot, not only here in the U.S, but it's a global melting-pot,"" he said.

Against Portugal and Germany in the remaining Group D games, Klinsmann will again draw from that pot.

732,"WASHINGTON/BUENOS AIRES The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear Argentina’s appeal over its battle with hedge funds that refused to take part in its debt restructurings, an unexpected move that risks toppling Latin America's No 3 economy into a new default.

The high court left intact lower court rulings that ordered Argentina to pay $1.33 billion to the so-called holdouts who refused 2005 and 2010 debt swaps in the wake of its catastrophic 2001-02 default on $100 billion.

This could open the door to claims from other holdouts worth as much as $15 billion, a hefty sum for a slowing economy struggling with rapidly dwindling foreign reserves.

The news triggered a nosedive in Argentine stocks and bonds after investors expected the court to delay its decision and give Argentina time to negotiate with holdouts or restructure its exchange bonds outside of New York legislation.

The impact on global markets was muted given the country's economic isolation since its default.

Argentina has previously refused to pay up. It argues it does not have the funds and cannot give holdouts preferential treatment over exchange bondholders after many of them bought the debt at a massive discount and are claiming payback in full.

If it sticks to that position, U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa could prevent full payment to exchange bondholders even though the country is able and willing to pay them.

This could result in a default by June 30, when payments are due on discount bonds governed by New York, further setting back Argentina's return to international capital markets.

""It's a very damaging scenario for Argentina,"" said Marco Lavagna at Ecolatina consultancy, noting that how lower courts implemented their rulings was key. ""Maybe something could open up there and allow for negotiation.

Argentina hinted last month it might consider negotiating with holdouts but could not do so until December 31 of this year when a clause in its debt swaps prohibiting it from offering holdouts better terms expires.

Whether Argentina can keep stalling investors and U.S. courts until that date remains to be seen.

Argentine stocks .MERV were down 7.3 percent by 1730 GMT, while the U.S. dollar-denominated benchmark 2033 Discount bonds ARGGLB33=RR fell 7.86 points in price to bid 75.010. Siobhan Morden, New York-based head of Latin American strategy at Jefferies LLC, said the market reaction was relatively mild as investors waited to see how the government would respond.

The government was not immediately available for comment on Monday but state-run news agency Telam said President Cristina Fernandez would deliver a televised address on Monday night.

The decision comes at an unfortunate time for Argentina which has been trying to normalize relations with foreign investors and creditors in order to regain access to international funds.

A DOUBLE BLOW

Argentina wants to avoid making full payment to holdouts led by hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and NML Capital Ltd, a unit of billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp, that Fernandez has slated as ""vultures"".

Creditors holding about 93 percent of Argentina's bonds agreed to participate in the two debt swaps in 2005 and 2010, accepting between 25 and 29 cents on the dollar.

Some groups such as the IMF, the Washington-based global lender, have said they are worried a ruling against Argentina will make it more difficult for other countries to restructure their debt and put financial calamity behind them.

""This is surprising because it is giving a precedent for any 'vulture fund' to go against any country, so any country is vulnerable in a restructure,"" said Sebastian Centurion at ABC Exchange.

Others say collective action clauses that are now broadly used now in sovereign debt issuance should prevent Argentina's particular case becoming a precedent. Emerging markets did not react to the news of the Supreme Court decision.

In a double blow to Argentina on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court also ruled that creditors can seek information about Argentina's non-U.S. assets in a case about bank subpoenas that is part of the country's decade-long litigation with holdouts.

The question was whether NML could enforce subpoenas against Bank of America and Banco de la Nacion Argentina. The court's ruling may nonetheless have limited impact in part because of Argentina's limited assets around the world.

NML has in the past pursued Argentine assets aggressively in its fight to get full repayment for its bonds, in 2012 even seizing an Argentine navy ship in Ghana.

On the issue of paying bondholders, Argentina had said in its most recent court filing that the government would struggle to pay the bondholders in full while also serving its restructured debt.

In that scenario, ""Argentina will have to face, objectively, a serious and imminent risk of default,"" the filing said.

The bondholders dispute that assessment, saying in their own court filing there was evidence presented in lower courts that Argentina could afford to pay.

""We are reviewing the decisions from the Supreme Court today and what the next steps might be, but we have no other comment at this time,"" a spokesman for NML told Reuters.

HAY-ON-WYE Wales Money and power are all well and good but if you really want to live a successful life, get more sleep and turn the phone off.

That was the message from Arianna Huffington, founder of the online Huffington Post and one of the world's most prominent - and wired-in - businesswomen, to an audience at the Hay Festival of literature and arts, which ended on Sunday.

Political and business leaders across the world, and the people who work for them, are often living lives of sleep deprivation and burnout in pursuit of the two traditional measures of success - money and power, Huffington said.

But those who chase these two goals alone are likely to come crashing down. ""This is like trying to sit on a two-legged stool. Sooner or later you fall off,"" she said.

Huffington should know. Seven years ago, she collapsed from overwork and exhaustion, banging her head as she fell.

""By any sane definition, when you come to in a pool of your own blood ... you are not successful,"" she said on Saturday at the book festival in Wales.

The first result of what she calls her wake-up call was to get more sleep. ""It's like a miracle drug,"" she said.

The Huffington Post newsroom includes two ""nap rooms"" where journalists can grab 40 winks.

Many in today's hectic working world wear their busy-ness like a badge of honor, Huffington said. Instead, the weary make mistakes and their creativity is blunted.

Too many of us are glued to mobile devices in a bid to get ahead in an increasingly interconnected world.

Huffington has captured her thoughts on how to live a better life in a book ""Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Happier Life"", which was published in March.

The book recommend four things: wellbeing, including a good night's sleep, a capacity for wonder, wisdom and giving.

Apart from the nap rooms, the Huffington philosophy manifests itself in the Huffpost newsroom in other ways: when employees are not working, they are not expected to check their emails - the office will call or text if necessary.

And, said Huffington, all Huffpost managers have specific hiring instructions - ""no brilliant jerks allowed"".

NEW YORK The dollar dipped and Wall Street equities treaded water on Wednesday as global markets puzzled over the odds Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will soon strike a more hawkish tone on monetary policy.

Prices of U.S. Treasuries took back losses from Tuesday, when data showed American inflation running at an unexpectedly high 2 percent a year, and were up ahead of a Federal Open Market Committee policy statement and Yellen news conference scheduled for later on Wednesday.

""We are seeing a lot of caution ahead of the FOMC,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. ""We see some modest pressure on the dollar.""

The dollar index that gauges the greenback against the euro, Japanese yen and four other currencies dipped 0.13 percent to 80.523 .DXY.

U.S. stocks were little changed after a three-day winning streak for the S&P 500 index as investors largely shrugged off mounting tensions in Iraq.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 25.07 points or 0.15 percent, to 16,783.42, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.14 points or 0.01 percent, to 1,942.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.23 points or 0.05 percent, to 4,335.00.Adobe Systems (ADBE.O) jumped 8 percent to $72.98 as the best performer on the S&P 500 after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.

Trading in Treasuries also focused on Fed policy and prices rose after the Bank of England released minutes from its policy meeting that were less hawkish than expected.

Investors, who had been surprised last week when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain could become the first major economy to tighten monetary policy since the 2008 financial crisis, got comfort from the Bank of England minutes highlighting a need to lift rates gradually.

""The minutes were less hawkish than what Carney said last week,” said Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York.

Benchmark 10-year notes rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.63 percent, down from 2.65 percent late on Monday. Intermediate-dated debt also outperformed, with five-year notes gaining 5/32 in price to yield 1.72 percent, down from 1.75 percent.

The risk of a faster U.S. policy tightening was high enough to keep European stocks from hitting new multi-year highs.

The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares was off 0.04 percent at 1,387.10.

In other markets, Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose to near $114 per barrel as a strike by Sunni militants on a key refinery near Baghdad stoked worries about oil exports from key producer Iraq.

NEW YORK The dollar retreated against the euro and the yen on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve struck a dovish tone in its post-meeting statement, slashing its forecast for economic growth and suggesting long-term rates could be lower than previously indicated.

Investors were expecting the Fed to upgrade its assessment of the U.S. economy in the wake of some better-than-expected numbers following weather-driven struggles in the first quarter.

That didn't happen though as the Fed cut its forecast for U.S. economic growth to a range of between 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent for 2014 from an earlier forecast of around 2.9 percent.

""The statement was largely dovish."" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Credit Agricole in New York. ""People were expecting the Fed to acknowledge the firmer inflation prints and the drop in the unemployment rate.""

The Fed, as expected, reduced its monthly asset purchases from $45 billion to $35 billion a month, divided between $20 billion of Treasury securities and $15 billion of mortgage-backed debt.

In afternoon trading, the dollar was down slightly against the yen at 102.12 yen JPY=, while the euro was up 0.1 percent versus the greenback at $1.3562 EUR=.

Prices in the futures market were consistent with the view that the Fed will start raising rates by the middle of next year.

More importantly, the Fed lowered its projections for long-term interest rates. The median projection was for a long-term federal funds rate of around 3.75 percent, compared to 4 percent in March.

""The bond market had largely priced this in via the spring bond rally,"" said Anthony Valeri, investment strategist, at LPL Financial in san Diego.

""Offsetting the drop in the long-term fed funds rate was an increase in short-term rate hike expectations. On balance, this should slightly reinforce the lower for longer theme.""

BOE SETS THE TABLE

Earlier, the Bank of England released minutes from its June 4-5 meeting, which showed members wanted to see more evidence of economic slack being absorbed before raising rates. That news weakened the pound against the dollar and the euro.

The tone of recent comments by policymakers, including BOE Governor Mark Carney last Thursday, had bolstered expectations that one of the committee members may have voted for an increase earlier this month.

Sterling GBP=D4 last traded up 0.1 percent at $1.6974, while the euro EURGBP=D4 gained 0.1 percent against the pound to 79.94 pence.

William Egan, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) top investment banker for financial institutions, has resigned to join credit investment and private equity firm Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N), according to people familiar with the matter.

The move from a major investment bank to an alternative asset manager illustrates the growing appeal of non-bank financial firms to finance professionals as new financial regulations after the 2008 financial crisis reshape Wall Street's competitive landscape.

Egan has left his job as co-head of Bank of America's global financial institutions group to join Oaktree, the people said on Tuesday. Egan is joining Oaktree for a leadership role in a new life reinsurance company, some of the people added.

Alternative asset managers are often keen to manage the assets of life insurance and reinsurance firms because the liabilities of these firms are seen as a good fit for the returns of their credit portfolios.

An internal Bank of America memo sent by Karim Assef, head of global investment banking coverage, and seen by Reuters, named Jim O' Neil, who was co-head of global financial institutions alongside Egan, as the sole head of that business.

The sources asked not to be identified because Egan's move is not public. Egan could not be immediately reached for comment while Bank of America and Oaktree declined to comment.

Egan joined Merrill Lynch in 1999 as head of its insurance investment banking practice. He was previously with Credit Suisse First Boston. He was appointed Bank of America's global head of financial institutions in 2009.

Rob Giammarco and Gary Swidler are co-heads of the Americas financial institutions group and Michael Frieser runs the financial institutions group in Europe, Middle East and Africa for Bank of America.

Los Angeles-based Oaktree had $86.2 billion in assets under management as of the end of March, the majority of which were in private and public corporate debt.

Unlike its credit investment rival Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), which manages $59.2 billion on behalf of its life insurance and reinsurance company Athene Holding Ltd, Oaktree has yet to announce any plans for such a venture.

WASHINGTON The pricing model used by U.S. stock exchanges to attract liquidity came under fire on Tuesday, as a top Wall Street executive called for ending the practice and two U.S. senators raised concerns about the potential conflicts it creates.

In a Senate hearing, an official from Intercontinental Exchange's (ICE.N) New York Stock Exchange expressed support for ending the ""maker-taker"" model used to reward brokers who make offers to buy or sell stocks on exchanges.

""We are seeking support for the elimination of maker-taker pricing,"" said NYSE President Thomas Farley. ""Broad adoption of this policy would reduce the conflicts inherent in such pricing schema.""

A top official at Vanguard also called for revisiting the practice, saying it has become too conflict-ridden.

Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations comes shortly after author Michael Lewis released a book that raised questions about payment for order flow and accused high-speed traders of rigging markets.

Earlier this month, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White announced a series of proposed reforms to address high-speed trading, trading in anonymous ""dark pool"" venues and potential conflicts that may influence how brokerages route customer orders.

White also asked exchanges to review order types, an issue Farley said his exchange will address in part through a six-month moratorium on permitting any ""new or novel"" order types.

But while White outlined a proposal to enhance disclosures surrounding how brokerages route institutional orders, she did not explicitly propose maker-taker reforms.

STUDY RAISES QUESTIONS

In the maker-taker model, brokerages earn rebates by sending in resting orders to bring more liquidity, but must pay fees if they take away liquidity through orders that can be executed immediately.

In addition, large market makers like KCG Holdings (KCG.N), Citadel LLC, Citigroup (C.N) and UBS AG UBSN.VX, typically pay cash fees in the neighborhood of 30 cents per hundred shares for orders.

The maker-taker model came under scrutiny last year after researchers from the University of Notre Dame and Indiana University released a study suggesting that payment-for-order-flow practices may create conflicts and prevent customers from receiving the best price in the shortest possible time frame.

The study looked at four discount brokerages that accept payments for order flow: TD Ameritrade AMTD.N, E*Trade, Scottrade [SCTRD.UL] and Fidelity Investments.

It found the firms tend to route ""limit orders"" to the exchanges that pay the highest rebate fees - a conflict that may prevent orders from being filled and violate best execution rules.

The Senate panel's chairman, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, and its ranking member, Republican John McCain of Arizona, both said they were troubled by the findings, and McCain called for more transparency on the payments to brokers.

McCain also called for changes to rules which he claimed force firms to take the ""bait"" of high-speed traders who dangle great prices in front of investors, and then rush ahead to buy it first and sell it higher.

On Wednesday, a U.S. Senate Banking Committee panel will also be holding a hearing on high-frequency trading. Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, the panel’s new chairman, told Reuters in an interview Tuesday he plans to focus mostly on how high-speed trading could be impacting smaller companies.

Not all experts on Tuesday were enthused about eliminating maker-taker pricing, showing how it could be difficult to pursue changes to the model.

BATS Global Markets exchange CEO Joe Ratterman said maker-taker pricing encourages liquidity makers to ""post tighter bid-offer spreads"" that benefit all investors and urged regulators to focus on enhancing disclosures to manage conflicts.

Steven Quirk, a senior vice president at TD Ameritrade, whose firm was highlighted in the study, questioned the study's findings, and stressed that his brokerage follows best execution requirements.

But Levin pressed Quirk on why TD Ameritrade disclosures often showed it had sent most of its non-marketable orders to the exchanges with the highest rebates.

""Your subjective judgment as to which market provided best execution contends that millions of customer orders virtually always led you to route orders to the markets that paid you the most?"" Levin asked.

When Quirk interjected that it wasn't ""always,"" Levin quipped: ""I said virtually always.""

""Virtually, yeah,"" Quirk replied.

Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin expressed skepticism about the gravity of the conflict problem, and questioned the research of Robert Battalio, an author of the study.

""If I am doing a $2,000 trade, you're concerned about a conflict of interest where I might have to pay an additional 40 cents? Is that what this is about?"" Johnson asked.

""No, it's about the fact that you didn't get to trade,"" Battalio shot back. ""Your assumption that you trade is wrong.""

LONDON, June 18 European stock markets edged up on Wednesday to go back within reach of multi-year highs reached last week, with insurer Aegon rallying after announcing a share buyback programme.

However, gains on the stock markets were capped as investors awaited the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting later in the day.

The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index also advanced by 0.3 percent to 3,285.28 points.

Aegon was the top performer, in percentage terms, on the FTSEurofirst 300 index.

Aegon rose 2.7 percent, which traders attributed to the company's announcement late on Tuesday - after markets had closed - of a share buyback programme.

""Aegon is cleaning up its balance sheet, and this share buyback should also help,"" said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, whose portfolio includes Aegon shares.

OIL SHARES RISE

Shares in oil groups, such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP, also rose as the Brent crude price advanced towards $114 a barrel as Sunni militants pushed forward in northern Iraq, striking a key refinery near Baghdad and stoking worries about oil exports from the key producer.

Credit Suisse strategists upgraded their position on the global energy equity sector to ""benchmark"" for the first time in six years, citing expectations of a rise in the oil price and improving corporate earnings in the sector.

""Earnings revisions are at their strongest for 18 months, marginally above the market, and the 10 percent gap between the spot and consensus oil price suggests this should continue,"" said Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at Credit Suisse.

762,"* Upside inflation surprise helps lift demand for USD

* Market awaits Fed meeting outcome, Yellen news conference

* Sterling gives up gains after BoE minutes

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, June 18 The dollar held gains against the yen on Wednesday after higher-than-expected U.S. consumer prices for May fanned speculation that the Federal Reserve may inch closer towards raising interest rates.

The U.S. currency also rose against the pound after the minutes from the Bank of England's last policy meeting proved not to be as hawkish as many were expecting.

The tone of recent comments from policymakers, including a U-turn from Governor Mark Carney from dove to hawk on monetary policy, had bolstered expectations that one of the committee members may have voted for an increase earlier this month.

Against the yen, the dollar reached a one-week high of 102.31. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to trade at $1.6935.

The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in May, double what economists had expected, raising the possibility that a separate inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve also pushed higher in May.

News of the pick-up in inflation was announced as Fed policymakers prepared to conclude a two-day meeting. The Fed is widely expected to chop another $10 billion from its monthly bond purchases, but is considered unlikely to make other concrete policy moves.

""We are expecting the Fed to raise their inflation forecasts, but that is more or less expected,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency analyst at Nomura, London.

""Clearly the momentum is picking up in the U.S. and we are expecting the Fed to become more hawkish in the third quarter. Hence we are recommending buying the dollar against low-yielding currencies like the yen.""

The focus will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference for any clues on longer-term plans for rates. She is expected to provide a more balanced view on the future path of interest rates, but any hawkish hints could send Treasury yields soaring and help the dollar.

A recent Reuters poll found a majority of Wall Street's top bond firms do not see the Fed raising rates before the second half of next year.

BOE VS FED

The BoE is expected to tighten policy before that. BoE chief Mark Carney's warning last week that markets were too sanguine about the chances of a 2014 hike had earlier this week sent the pound soaring past $1.70 for the first time since mid-2009.

But the minutes showed members wanted to see more evidence of economic slack being absorbed before raising rates. None voted for a rate rise, quashing market speculation that at least two members made have done so in the June meeting. That news sent the pound lower against the dollar and the euro .

764,"(Adds comment, details from FOMC statement, second byline, dateline) By Frank Tang and Harpreet Bhal NEW YORK/LONDON, June 18 Gold edged up on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hinted at a slightly faster pace of interest rate increases next year but slashed its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year, lifting bullion's safe-haven appeal. After a two-day policy meeting, the central bank slashed its forecast for U.S. economic growth to a range of between 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent from an earlier forecast of around 2.9 percent, but expressed confidence the recovery was largely on track. ""The growth forecast reduction suggested that the Fed may not be in a hurry to accelerate tapering,"" said James Steel, chief metals analyst at HSBC. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,273.40 an ounce by 2:34 p.m. EDT (1834 GMT), after trading in a narrow $9 trading range. U.S. COMEX gold futures for August delivery settled up 70 cents at $1,272.70 an ounce, with trading volume less than 80,000 lots, about 45 percent below the 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. The Fed also reduced its monthly asset purchases from $45 billion to $35 billion, but suggested rates eventually would be lower than it had indicated previously. Gold market participants have been monitoring the Fed's policy statements for clues on when it might begin raising interest rates, a move likely to weigh on bullion, which does not offer its holders interest or dividends. A high reading for U.S. inflation on Tuesday raised expectations the Fed might signal a sooner-than-expected rise in interest rates. Tightening rates would also lift the dollar and put pressure on dollar-priced commodities like gold. Gold hit a three-week high of $1,284.85 on Monday due to volatility sparked by violence in Iraq, but prices have dropped since then. Gold is up nearly 2 percent so far in June. Reflecting bearish investor sentiment toward bullion, holdings in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 0.26 tonne to 782.62 tonnes on Tuesday, a second straight day of declines. The fund posted its biggest outflow since mid-April on Monday. Among other precious metals, silver rose 0.6 percent to $19.80 an ounce. Platinum rose 1 percent to $1,446.90, and palladium gained 1 percent to $821.75 an ounce. Platinum group investors digested news that Anglo American Platinum and other companies confirmed that a large number of employees had returned to South Africa's platinum belt after spending the strike period elsewhere. 2:34 PM EDT LAST/ NET PCT LOW HIGH CURRENT SETTLE CHNG CHNG VOL US Gold AUG 1272.70 0.70 0.1 1266.50 1276.00 77,356 US Silver SEP 19.821 0.045 0.2 19.710 19.870 6,706 US Plat JUL 1450.80 7.70 0.5 1438.50 1464.00 12,552 US Pall SEP 822.65 5.95 0.7 817.25 834.50 4,274 Gold 1273.40 2.21 0.2 1266.60 1274.50 Silver 19.800 0.110 0.6 19.700 19.820 Platinum 1446.90 14.40 1.0 1438.70 1460.00 Palladium 821.75 8.45 1.0 818.20 831.70 TOTAL MARKET VOLUME 30-D ATM VOLATILITY CURRENT 30D AVG 250D AVG CURRENT CHG US Gold 78,493 147,571 165,114 13.09 -0.05 US Silver 46,572 49,807 55,340 17.72 0.18 US Platinum 15,935 14,585 12,336 17.38 -0.36 US Palladium 4,319 9,189 5,899 21.01 0.01 (Additional reporting by A.

766,"PARIS, April 11 Global supply and demand for crude oil should continue to be fairly balanced this year, the secretary general of OPEC said, signalling the group is likely to leave its existing output ceiling in place at its June meeting.

""Looking at the current situation, we see the market as relatively balanced, and we expect this to be the case for the rest of 2014,"" Abdullah al-Badri, of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said on Friday.

In a speech to the Petrostrategies' International Oil Summit in Paris, he said OPEC's crude output was currently close to 30 million barrels a day, its official production target.

""This is what is required by the market,"" he said.

OPEC expects its output to remain steady in the medium term at 29 million to 30 million barrels a day, he said, adding that this would mean a rise in spare capacity towards what he described as ""comfortable levels"".

OPEC this week lowered its oil demand outlook for 2014 and ended a run of upward revisions to global consumption growth, highlighting concerns over the economy and pressure on its market share from rival producers.

In a separate report on Friday, the International Energy Agency also forecast that world oil demand would rise less than previously thought this year due to a lower outlook for Russia's economic growth following its annexation of Crimea.

The IEA also reduced its expectations for the supply increase from non-OPEC countries this year, however, saying that OPEC would have to raise its production from March levels, which it estimated at 29.62 million bpd.

Prices for benchmark Brent oil futures have traded so far this year in a relatively narrow range of about $104 to $112 per barrel.

""Prices have held fairly steady for the past 18 months or so. It is a level that has been acceptable to both producers and consumers,"" Badri said.

""In recent months, there has also been talk of falling prices. This is obviously difficult to assess.""

LONDON Oil companies lifted Britain's blue chip share index on Wednesday as heavy fighting in Iraq pushed crude prices towards $114 (67.25 pounds) a barrel.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BG Group BG.L rose 1.5 percent and 0.6 percent respectively, helping the UK oil and gas index .FTNMX0530 gain 1.4 percent to make it the top sectoral performer in the FTSE 100 .FTSE.

""The market is very closely watching the escalating violence in Iraq, a major oil producer. In the short term, higher oil prices may benefit some oil companies, but in the longer term, if it continues, it will result in an oil shock,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays.

""Clearly that would be an overall negative for the economy as higher oil prices have the potential to hurt global growth and raise companies' input costs.""

Brent crude oil rose towards $114 a barrel as Sunni militants hit Iraq's biggest refinery, stoking concerns about oil exports from OPEC's second-biggest producer as some firms pulled foreign workers out.

The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed up 0.2 percent, or 11.79 points, at 6,778.56 points. The index is only up 0.4 percent this year, but is just some 2 percent below its record high hit in late 1999.

Shire (SHP.L) topped the blue-chip leader board, rising 3.4 as bid speculation continued to swirl around the healthcare group. It had seen solid gains on Tuesday after sources told Reuters it had hired investment bank Citi (C.N) as an adviser, expecting to receive takeover approaches.

In the broader market, investors avoided heavy bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to cut another $10 billion from its monthly bond purchases, while investors will be watching for any comments on when the Fed would begin to raise interest rates and its outlook for the economy.

Data released on Tuesday showed a surprisingly high reading for U.S. inflation, which sparked speculation of a hawkish tilt to the Fed's policy outlook.

The FTSE was also held back by United Utilities (UU.L) and Severn Trent (SVT.L) as the two companies traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts.

Their shares fell by 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent respectively.

CANNES France WPP, the world's biggest advertising group, has seen stronger demand from clients both in the United States and parts of Europe, Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said on Wednesday.

Speaking to Reuters at the annual Cannes Lions industry gathering, Sorrell said current trading was even stronger than in the first quarter, when WPP posted a much better than expected 7 percent like-for-like rise in revenue. ""I think we are stronger than the first quarter. April was strong, May was not as strong as April but satisfactory, and at the revenue level very strong,"" he said.

""The second quarter if anything will be the same or better than the first quarter.""

Meanwhile U.S. group IPG's chief executive Michael Roth declined to comment on second-quarter trading on Wednesday but said the economic backdrop, particularly in the United States, was increasing his confidence in his outlook for the company's performance this year.

""Based on the first quarter, we were on track to deliver our objectives of at least 3 to 4 percent organic growth and at least 100 basis-point margin expansion,"" he told Reuters in Cannes.

""Look at the macroeconomic environment. It's solid. It's consistent with what our objectives were for the full year.""

IPG, which owns agencies Deutsche and McCann, came second only to WPP in terms of revenue growth in the first quarter, beating Publicis and Omnicom with like-for-like growth of 6.6 percent.

Roth said it was nice to see some growth in continental Europe in the first quarter, and he expected the region to deliver like-for-like growth of about 1 percent for the year.

Sorrell, whose WPP owns GroupM, Ogilvy & Mather and JWT, said demand was stronger in established markets like the United States, Britain, and Germany, while some emerging markets, which he has long championed, had seen their faster rates of growth slow.

""The faster growth markets are slower growth, but they are still faster than the slower growth markets, which have got faster,"" he said.

WORLD CUP

Brazil, however, was seeing a boost from demand for advertising around the World Cup soccer tournament.

""The World Cup has certainly helped in Brazil and it is turning out to be a great tournament despite the infrastructure issues people were worried about,"" he said. ""On the field it's very good.""

Fresh from seeing IPG agency FCB Brasil win a Mobile Grand Prix at Cannes Lions for its work on skincare products firm Beiersdorf's Nivea brand, Roth was also positive on Latin America.

""The World Cup is a one-off, it's a big one, but the real strength in that market is not just the World Cup it's the overall economic environment that's there,"" he said.

Sorrell said that of other faster-growth markets, India was performing well, despite the distractions of elections, while China, which was flat in the first quarter, had ""a good April and an OK May"".

He took WPP into emerging markets faster and more aggressively than some rivals and said he continued to favour them, with another deal expected to be announced in days.

""The slowing down of those markets gives us more opportunity (to do deals),"" he said.

PARIS General Electric's (GE.N) chief executive will on Thursday unveil to the French government and unions an improved offer for the energy arm of Alstom, a source close to the U.S. conglomerate said of its efforts to fend off a rival proposal.

Alstom's board is due to announce by Monday its choice between GE's 12.4-billion-euro (9.91 billion pounds) cash offer and a competing proposal by Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T).

The fight for the power business of the 86-year-old French company has turned into one of Europe's fiercest industrial tug-of-wars for years, drawing in a French Socialist government which has given itself powers to veto any deal in the name of protecting local jobs and influence over a key sector.

""GE is seeing the government and the Alstom unions tomorrow,"" the source close to GE said on Wednesday. ""The offer will, of course, be improved.""

A separate source close to the matter confirmed the meeting and added that Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg was set to meet GE management around midday on Thursday, before meeting with Alstom unions in the afternoon.

Almost immediately after Siemens and MHI presented their rival plan on Tuesday, President Francois Hollande's government told both sides to come up with better offers.

Siemens says its proposal with MHI values Alstom's power arm at 14.2 billion euros - nearly two billion euros more than GE's.

But the two offers are very different in nature. Whereas the former involves Siemens buying just the gas turbines arm of Alstom and MHI taking minority stakes in its other power activities, the GE offer is for all Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses and accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.

An ad hoc committee of independent board directors, led by former chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) Jean-Martin Folz, is due to give a recommendation on the merits of the two proposals to the Alstom board, likely on Friday, according to a source close to Alstom.

ALLIANCES

Both GE and Siemens-MHI have stressed their commitments to keeping and creating jobs in France to win political favour.

GE has said a deal with Alstom would create 1,000 French jobs within three years but the government is eager for it to formalise the pledge on paper. GE is also expected to address concerns over French access to strategic assets such as power equipment used in nuclear plants, wind and hydro turbines, as well as the fate of Alstom's remaining rail arm.

GE has been discussing those parts of the deal with the government over the past weeks.

GE's Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told French lawmakers last month his group would set up global headquarters for the grid, hydro, offshore wind and steam turbines businesses in France. Immelt also said GE was considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that GE was now considering selling the unit to Alstom.

Montebourg has said he would not let Alstom be ""devoured"" and is worried that the group, an innovator and big private employer in the country, would be weakened if reduced to its rail arm, which accounts for a quarter of group revenue.

A source familiar with the matter said the government was looking for GE to offer more balanced ""alliances"".

""Alliances can take various forms... It can be capital alliances, industrial tie-ups, it can be joint-ventures, shareholdings,"" the source said.

The same source said the government would make its view known at least to Alstom before its decisive board meeting.

BOUYGUES QUESTION MARK

After a meeting with Montebourg on Tuesday, some Alstom unions welcomed the Siemens-MHI plan, saying that it would better preserve Alstom.

But several sources close to Alstom told Reuters they were concerned about the relative complexity of the Siemens-MHI plan and that, unlike the GE offer, they did not consider it as having binding status.

Those sources familiar with Alstom's thinking are sceptical that the Siemens-MHI plan can address Alstom's core problems: its lack of critical mass in a tough power market and the need to inject cash into its more promising transport arm.

An all-cash purchase by GE of the power arm could return an exceptional dividend to Alstom shareholders and allow the company to refocus on its transport arm known for making France's iconic TGV bullet trains.

Ratings agency Moody's said in a note that the Siemens/MHI offer had the potential to strengthen Alstom financially and bring its debt down.

""It would however also leave Alstom in control of structurally declining (coal power generation) or competitive and oversupplied (power grid) businesses, whose further development could prove challenging,"" Moody's said.

Further question marks remain over the intentions of 29-percent shareholder Bouygues. The group has publicly stated it would support any decision made by Alstom's board and wanted to keep its shareholding at 29 percent in the long term.

However one source familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said it wanted a significant stake in a group which it believes has a future - with a stake of over 20 percent that enables it to consolidate related earnings - but would not want a diluted stake in a business it sees as wobbly. A spokesman for Bouygues said on Wednesday morning that MHI had offered to take a stake of up to 10 percent in Alstom by buying up some of its stake along with French public investment bank BPI. However he said Bouygues had not been approached by the state or BPI at this stage.

LONDON The Bank of England may be overestimating the amount of slack in Britain's labour market, pointing to a need for tighter monetary policy than it forecast in May, one of its policymakers said on Wednesday.

Martin Weale, an external member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, said the Bank could afford to tighten monetary policy slightly even if slack in the economy was greater than labour data currently suggest.

While acknowledging that wage growth was still unusually weak, monetary policy would still provide a great deal of support for the economy even after interest rates have started to rise gradually, said Weale in a speech in Belfast.

He said the measures of underemployment that contributed to the BoE's view of labour market slack in its inflation report in May in his view overstated the amount of spare capacity in the labour market.

Weale - known as one of the most hawkish members of the MPC - cited his own research that workers who were recently unemployed are less productive than average.

""If this is the case, then, as the economy continues to grow, unemployment could fall more quickly than the MPC expects. That on its own certainly points to a need for policy profile tighter than in our May forecast,"" he said.

Minutes from the MPC's June meeting on Wednesday showed policymakers were surprised that markets had not priced in a higher chance of an interest rate rise this year.

BoE Governor Mark Carney shocked markets last week by saying that a rise in interest rates could come sooner than markets had expected.

Weale underlined how balanced the case for tightening monetary policy was.

""I am sure we will all take note of the way that the (average earnings) data for April ... reinforced this sense of unusually low wage growth,"" he said.

In the three months through April, total pay including bonuses rose a yearly 0.7 percent, slowing from 1.9 percent in the three months to March. In the month of April alone, total pay fell by 1.7 percent compared with the same month last year.

LONDON Santander UK (SAN.MC) will become the first British bank to refer rejected applicants for loans to an alternative finance provider, a move its rivals could be forced to follow as Britain looks to boost lending to small businesses.

Britain's biggest banks have been accused of failing to provide sufficient credit to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the government is considering making it compulsory for them to direct failed loan applicants to alternative institutions, such as peer-to-peer lenders.

Santander said on Wednesday it would refer some of its SME customers to Funding Circle, one of Britain's biggest online lending platforms, in cases where it believed the peer-to-peer lender was ""better placed to help"".

""Santander's partnership with Funding Circle is a good example of how traditional, and alternative finance can work together to help the nation’s SMEs prosper,"" said Santander UK's Chief Executive Ana Botin.

Peer-to-peer loans allow investors to lend directly to individuals and businesses via low-cost online platforms.

Funding Circle's founder Samir Desai said Santander had ""created a blueprint for other banks to follow"".

As part of the agreement, Funding Circle said it would direct SMEs to Santander when they required day-to-day relationship banking or other services such as international banking and cash management.

Funding Circle has helped over 5,000 firms borrow more than 290 million pounds since its launch in 2010. Its investors include thousands of private individuals, the government-backed British Business Bank, and local councils. It lends businesses between 5,000 pounds and 1 million pounds and offers investors an average net return of 6.1 percent.

STOCKHOLM Hennes & Mauritz, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, plans to step up the pace of its online expansion next year to catch up with rivals in e-commerce.

The Swedish budget fashion firm also said on Wednesday that sales in June had got off to a good start after it reported second-quarter profit in line with analysts' forecasts due to brisk spring sales and increased market share.

H&M, which was slower than many of its peers to start selling online, said it would launch websites in eight to 10 markets in 2015 after rolling them out in Spain, Italy and China later this year.

It currently has an online presence in 10 markets, in many parts of Europe and the United States, less than half compared with Zara-owner Inditex, its bigger rival that sells online in 25 markets.

H&M Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson said both its physical and online stores were profitable, adding that the group had seen some loss of sales in stores as customers turned to its online channel.

""It's likely to continue for many years with younger people who grow up with more online shopping, but we still have a big belief in the physical stores so I think we can have a good development in both,"" he said.

H&M is investing heavily to develop new online sites and broaden its product offering with other brands such as COS, & Other Stories and H&M Home. It plans to open 375 stores this year, opening for the first time in the Philippines and India in the second half of the year.

Pretax profit was 7.6 billion Swedish crowns (0.65 billion pounds) for March through May, matching an average forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. Its gross margin was 60.8 percent - just below the forecast 61.2 percent.

""Our investments will affect H&M profitability in the short term negatively but in the long-term positively,"" Persson said.

H&M has faced increasing competition from discount rivals such as Britain's Primark and U.S. group Forever 21 which are expanding across Europe and from online firms such as Britain's ASOS and Germany's Zalando.

Persson told a news conference Primark was a really good player which the group had ""great respect for"".

Bernstein Research said in a note it expected H&M margins would continue to contract in the second half due to competition and rising wages in Asia where the retailer produces the vast majority of its garments.

Inditex said last week it would join China's fast-growing Tmall online marketplace, run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, to strengthen its presence in the country.

But Persson said H&M, which prefers to sell through its own channels, has no plans to make a similar move.

""We will not start there – we will start with our own. It's working well in the 10 markets where we are present. I believe that it will work well in China,"" he said.

H&M garments are all sold on its own sites, though the company does offer its Monki brand on ASOS.

H&M, which reported quarterly sales last week, said June sales were off to a good start after a near 20 percent increase in May and Persson said the picture was brighter across Europe, improving in places like Spain, Italy and Greece which are starting to recover from recessions.

""My best guess is that the worst is behind us and that it is stabilizing more, or slightly improving,"" he said.

Inditex said last week its sales rose 11 percent in local currencies between Feb. 1 and June 8, accelerating from the 8 percent it recorded in the year to Jan. 31.

880,"(Corrects investment target in second bullet to 1.8 trillion rupees from 180 billion)

* Plans investment of $11.7 bln in telecoms business

* Raises three-year investment target to 1.8 trillion rupees

* Ambani says market-based prices key to develop energy resources

By Aman Shah

MUMBAI, June 18 India's Reliance Industries Ltd will start offering fourth-generation (4G) telecommunications services next year, its chairman and India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, said on Wednesday, a move that will intensify competition in an already crowded market.

Reliance, India's third-most valuable company, gets most of its revenue from its sprawling energy empire. It has expanded into new businesses like retail, telecommunications and media in recent years as growth in its core energy business slows.

Reliance made a return to telecoms in 2010 by acquiring the only company that had won nationwide 4G airwaves in a government auction, but has yet to start services as it builds the business on an unproven and still-developing technology.

On Wednesday, Ambani told shareholders that Reliance was planning an investment of 700 billion rupees ($11.7 billion) in the telecoms business, Reliance Jio, and would launch services in phases across India in 2015.

Reliance's entry into the telecoms sector poses a threat to rivals like Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Group Plc and Idea Cellular Ltd, which in recent quarters managed to raise voice call prices after a years-long price war.

""Once (Reliance) Jio comes, voice charges will get disrupted because they typically bring in cheaper rates,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, a telecoms analyst at PhillipCapital.

Kulkarni, however, said Reliance's planned launch in 2015 gives ""some cushion"" to the existing telecom carriers. Some in the industry had expected Reliance to start services this year.

Reliance aims to offer high-speed data as well as voice services and added more airwaves from an auction this year.

""The objective is to ensure that everything that we offer is future-proof and world-class,"" Ambani told Reliance's annual shareholder meeting. ""Limited field trials with our initial set of services for the broad band services are already underway.""

Cash-rich Reliance plans to invest more than 1.8 trillion rupees ($30 billion) over a three-year period that ends in March 2016 across all its businesses, Ambani said. Last year, the company had announced plans to invest 1.5 trillion rupees over three years.

ENERGY INCOME FALLING

Reliance's move into telecoms are meant to cushion a decline in oil and gas revenue that has been hit by the falling output from its key gas block off India's east coast.

Reliance and its partners in the KG-D6 gas block - BP Plc and Niko Resources - are also locked in a dispute with the federal government over the implementation of higher gas prices.

Ambani said on Wednesday timely regulatory approvals and ""market-based gas prices"" were key to developing the resources.

The government in June last year approved a formula, linking prices of locally produced gas with global benchmarks, that could have nearly doubled gas prices from the current $4.20 per mmBtu from April 1.

That price increase was ordered to be deferred by the election regulator ahead of a general election and the new government that took power last month has yet to decide on the increase.

Reliance shares extended their fall after the shareholders' meeting and ended down 2.1 percent. Some traders said investors were disappointed by the absence of a plan to resolve the gas price dispute in Ambani's speech.

* Market awaits Fed meeting outcome, Yellen news conference

* Sterling gives up gains after BoE minutes

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, June 18 The dollar held gains against the yen on Wednesday after higher-than-expected U.S. consumer prices for May fanned speculation that the Federal Reserve may inch closer towards raising interest rates.

The U.S. currency also rose against the pound after the minutes from the Bank of England's last policy meeting proved not to be as hawkish as many were expecting.

The tone of recent comments from policymakers, including a U-turn from Governor Mark Carney from dove to hawk on monetary policy, had bolstered expectations that one of the committee members may have voted for an increase earlier this month.

Against the yen, the dollar reached a one-week high of 102.31. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to trade at $1.6935.

The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in May, double what economists had expected, raising the possibility that a separate inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve also pushed higher in May.

News of the pick-up in inflation was announced as Fed policymakers prepared to conclude a two-day meeting. The Fed is widely expected to chop another $10 billion from its monthly bond purchases, but is considered unlikely to make other concrete policy moves.

""We are expecting the Fed to raise their inflation forecasts, but that is more or less expected,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency analyst at Nomura, London.

""Clearly the momentum is picking up in the U.S. and we are expecting the Fed to become more hawkish in the third quarter. Hence we are recommending buying the dollar against low-yielding currencies like the yen.""

The focus will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference for any clues on longer-term plans for rates. She is expected to provide a more balanced view on the future path of interest rates, but any hawkish hints could send Treasury yields soaring and help the dollar.

A recent Reuters poll found a majority of Wall Street's top bond firms do not see the Fed raising rates before the second half of next year.

BOE VS FED

The BoE is expected to tighten policy before that. BoE chief Mark Carney's warning last week that markets were too sanguine about the chances of a 2014 hike had earlier this week sent the pound soaring past $1.70 for the first time since mid-2009.

But the minutes showed members wanted to see more evidence of economic slack being absorbed before raising rates. None voted for a rate rise, quashing market speculation that at least two members made have done so in the June meeting. That news sent the pound lower against the dollar and the euro .

""Given the lack of hawkish surprises we could see some profit-taking on long sterling positions,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi. ""Sterling/dollar looks vulnerable ahead of the Fed.""

By Jemima Kelly

LONDON, June 16 Britain's pound struggled to build on two days of gains on Monday, having topped $1.70 for the first time since August 2009 in early trade, in a market in part waiting for a Federal Reserve meeting later this week.

A blip higher for the euro against the dollar kept sterling roughly steady and within sight of a five-year high of $1.7011 reached at the start of European trading.

But against the euro, it was a touch weaker at 79.85 pence after hitting its strongest in 20 months at 79.59 pence.

Dealers and analysts said the week's key event for the pound was likely to be the minutes from the Bank of England's June policy meeting on Wednesday after what was read as a surprise hawkish U-turn on policy by Governor Mark Carney last Thursday.

The pound has gained more than 1 percent since then.

""Today was a little bit of a pause for reflection for sterling,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking.

""It's all the events ahead that are more important - the Bank of England minutes will be a clear focus as people wonder whether the dovish consensus on the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is gradually shifting.""

A rapidly improving UK economy has made sterling one of the past year's biggest winners on major currency markets but until Carney's comments on Thursday - seen as a reversal of his previous dovish stance - doubts had been creeping in.

An interview given on Sunday by Carney's deputy Charlie Bean added fuel to market speculation that the balance of opinion on the bank's policy committee may be fast changing in favour of raising the premium for holding sterling.

Bean said he was optimistic about growth and would welcome the bank's starting to ""normalise"" interest rates. Many analysts now expect the minutes on Wednesday to show at least one member backing an immediate hike.

""All of these remarks do suggest the tide is turning at the Bank of England,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London. ""Whether that means that a hike by the end of this year is on the cards, we are not sure. But these minutes may go some way to showing us.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday also may hint at when it will start to raise rates after the projected end to its monthly quantitative easing programme in September or October.

POLICY MIX

Many economists say privately that the BoE will be reluctant to raise rates close to parliamentary elections next May, which look set to be as tightly fought as 2010 polls that generated Britain's first hung parliament in decades.

With finance minister George Osborne's Conservatives promising more spending cuts and facing threats from populist anti-EU party UKIP and the main centre-left Labour opposition, the outcome of the election may prove important for the BoE's assessment of fiscal policy prospects.

But a number of economists also argue the shift in the bank's tone may be in part due to concerns over the housing sector and potential impact on thousands of heavily borrowed households, for which higher rates might be crippling.

""This ... is more about when the bank starts its journey rather than its intended destination,"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a note on Monday. ""We expect a slow and limited tightening cycle. And one in which tighter macroprudential and monetary policy moves complement each other.""

Economists at the world's second-biggest currency trader, Deutsche Bank, on Friday brought forward its prediction for a first rise in BoE rates by six months, to November from May. Credit Suisse followed suit on Monday.

A number of analysts also speculate that Carney may have changed message so quickly in order to ensure he was not left behind by the consensus on the council.

""Strength could continue heading into Wednesday's minutes,"" Citi analysts said in a morning note. ""Indications a more hawkish contingent are growing closer to, or in fact voted for, hikes in June are likely to spur on the recent rally.""

By Anirban Nag

LONDON, June 18 The dollar held its gains on Wednesday after a broad firming on the back of higher-than-expected U.S. consumer prices for May that has fanned speculation that the Federal Reserve may inch closer towards hiking interest rates.

In the European session, the focus will be on the minutes from the Bank of England's last policy meeting. The tone of recent comments from policymakers, including Governor Mark Carney, has bolstered expectations that the minutes will be hawkish and could push sterling towards the $1.70 mark.

The dollar index last stood at 80.613, having climbed 0.2 percent on Tuesday. Against the yen, the greenback reached a one-week high of 102.31, while the euro retreated from a one-week peak hit on Tuesday to trade flat at $1.3550.

The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in May, double what economists had expected, raising the possibility that a separate inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve also pushed higher in May.

The pick-up in inflation came as Fed policymakers prepared to conclude a two-day meeting. The Fed is widely expected to chop another $10 billion from its monthly bond purchases, but is considered unlikely to make other concrete policy moves.

""It's been a while since Yellen's last conference. So markets will be keen to know what she thinks of the economy after this inflation data,"" said Takako Masai, executive officer at Shinsei Bank.

A recent Reuters poll found a majority of Wall Street's top bond firms do not see the Fed raising rates before the second half of next year.

FOCUS ON THE BOE

Sterling was firm against the dollar and the euro before the release of the BoE minutes. It was up 0.1 percent at $1.6985 , while the euro was slightly weaker at 79.80 pence .

The pound crossed the $1.70 level on Monday for the first time in nearly five years as investors added to bullish bets on the currency. It gave up some gains on Tuesday after softer-than-expected UK inflation, but expectations that the BoE could act before the Fed in raising rates provided support.

Governor Carney surprised investors last Thursday by saying rates may rise before many were predicting, prompting investors to bring forward expectations for a first UK rate hike to before the end of this year from the first quarter of 2015.

""Investors' perception of a monetary policy committee bias leaning towards earlier removal of policy accommodation should dominate,"" said Adam Myers, European head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole.

""Indeed, coming off the back of an unambiguously hawkish statement from Governor Carney, we expect even tentative evidence in the minutes of a looming shift in voter complexion will benefit sterling as short-term interest rate spreads move in the currency's favour against both the euro and the dollar.""

NEW YORK The dollar slipped against most major currencies on Wednesday on expectations the Federal Reserve is not prepared to increase interest rates within the next 12 months despite signs domestic inflation is inching higher.

Sterling receded further from its five-year high against the greenback after the minutes from the Bank of England's policy meeting two weeks ago turned out less hawkish than expected.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, will conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday. It was widely expected to shave another $10 billion (5.90 billion pounds) from its monthly bond purchases to $35 billion, but unlikely to hint at any rate increases due to relatively high unemployment and inflation running below its 2 percent target.

""We are seeing a lot of caution ahead of the FOMC. We see some modest pressure on the dollar,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.

The dollar index that gauges the greenback against the euro, yen and four other currencies, dipped 0.14 percent at 80.508 .DXY, which was within the range established since hitting a four-month high earlier this month.

The dollar gave back Tuesday's gains linked to data that showed U.S. consumer prices rising 0.4 percent in May, its fastest monthly pace in more than a year. The bigger-than-expected increase in the consumer price index had raised bets this might spur Fed policy-makers sooner than what some traders had thought.

After the FOMC statement at 2 p.m. (1900 BST), traders will focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) where she is expected to hold down expectations of an imminent rate increases, which could hurt the dollar.

""She will stay fairly dovish,"" Harajli said.

A recent Reuters poll found a majority of Wall Street's top bond firms do not see the Fed raising rates before the second half of next year.

BOE SETS THE TABLE

Earlier the Bank of England released minutes on its June 4-5 meeting which showed members wanted to see more evidence of economic slack being absorbed before raising rates. That news weakened the pound against the dollar and the euro.

The tone of recent comments from policymakers, including those from Governor Mark Carney last Thursday, had bolstered expectations that one of the committee members may have voted for an increase earlier this month.

""Given the lack of hawkish surprises we could see some profit-taking on long sterling positions,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Citi in London.

BoE chief Mark Carney's warning last week that markets were too sanguine about the chances of a 2014 hike had earlier this week sent the pound soaring past $1.70 for the first time since mid-2009.

Sterling GBP=D4 last traded 0.12 percent lower at $1.6944, while the euro EURGBP=D4 gained 0.28 percent against the pound at 80.09 pence.

NEW YORK, June 18 Wall Street stocks jumped on Wednesday, taking the S&P 500 index of top companies to an all-time record after the Federal Reserve promised to keep in place low interest-rate policies and forecast the world's biggest economy would expand moderately.

Treasuries prices also gained, as the dollar added to mild losses posted ahead of a Fed policy statement and a news conference by U.S. central bank chief Janet Yellen, who calmed investor worries she might adopt a more hawkish tone on monetary policy.

""Steady as she goes, with respect to policy,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director at Action Economics in San Francisco. ""A lot of the doves want to make sure the recovery is for real and is in place and (are) still maintaining a very accommodative posture.""

Global markets worried that Yellen and the Fed might move more quickly than anticipated toward unwinding a low interest rate regime begun in 2008. But those worries appear to have dissipated.

The S&P 500 gained 14.99 points or 0.77 percent, to finish at 1,956.98, eclipsing the previous record set on June 9.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.13 points, or 0.58 percent, to end at 16,906.62. The Nasdaq Composite added 25.60 points or 0.59 percent, to 4,362.84 as U.S. equities extended a three-day winning streak

Among the biggest gainers was FedEx Corp, which rose 6.2 percent to $148.95 after hitting an all-time intraday high of $149.34. Its gains helped push the Dow Jones Transportation average up 1.5 percent.

Treasury debt traders had been especially worried Yellen might turn toward hawkish policies.

“There were a lot of people that thought there would be a lot more mention of inflation there, that there would have been a more hawkish tone, but on balance it came out fairly dovish,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.

Benchmark 10-year notes gained 17/32 in price to yield 2.59 percent. Five-year notes rose 11/32 in price to yield 1.67 percent.

In currency trading, the dollar retreated against the euro and the yen on the Fed's still-dovish tone, a cut in its forecast for economic growth and a hint long-term rates could be lower than previously indicated.

The dollar fell 0.22 percent against the yen at 101.93 yen, while the euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.3592. The dollar index reflecting the greenback against six other currencies dipped 0.3 percent to 80.387 .

The risk of a faster U.S. policy tightening was enough to keep European stocks from hitting new multi-year highs. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares slipped 0.02 percent at 1,387.44. A measure of world stock markets added 0.48 percent.

Brent crude oil rose 86 cents to a nine-month high at $114.31 as a strike by Sunni militants on a refinery near Baghdad stoked worries about oil exports. U.S. crude fell 39 cents to settle at $105.97 a barrel, the lowest since June 11.

894,"SHANGHAI Chinese prosecutors on Tuesday started a trial of a former Agricultural Bank of China Ltd executive suspected of taking around $5 million(2.95 million pounds)in bribes, the country's Supreme Court said on Tuesday.

The government has cracked down on official corruption and extravagance in China since President Xi Jinping's appointment last year.

Yang Kun, who was the vice president and deputy governor of the state-owned bank, allegedly took 30.79 million yuan worth of bribes while in office during 2005 to 2012, according to a notice posted on the court's website on Tuesday. The trial of Yang Kun will be held in the Nanjing Intermediate People's Court.

The brief statement did not give any further details.

Xinhua news agency said last year Yang was under investigation for serious violations of the law.

The start of Yang's trial comes within a week of the launch of an investigation into the ""disciplinary violations"" of the ex-vice-chairman of China's top parliamentary advisory body.

China's top prosecutor is investigating a senior executive with state broadcaster CCTV on suspicion of bribery, the official Xinhua news agency reported earlier in the month.

China's attempts to tackle corruption have also netted high-profile company heads, such as Xu Minjie, an ex-executive director of China COSCO Holdings Co Ltd, who was accused of graft in early June.

Officials at AgBank could not be reached for comment. Attempts to reach Yang were also unsuccessful.

The survey of 1,500 households was conducted from June 11 to June 16, straddling a major speech last Thursday from BoE Governor Mark Carney who said interest rates could rise sooner than financial markets expected.

The findings were part of Markit's monthly Household Finance Index, which rose in June to 42.5 from 42.3 in May, not far off April's record high of 43.0. The index measures households' perception of their overall well-being.

Dating back to early 2009, it has risen sharply in recent months but a reading below 50 still represents households feeling worse off.

Markit also noted that expectations for the next 12 months hit a five-month low.

""The fall in households' financial expectations coincides with greater prospects of an interest rate hike before the end of 2014,"" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit.

""Policymakers will be keeping a close eye on households' reaction to the possibility of more expensive mortgages, given the need to ensure that consumer demand is not choked off by further shifts towards policy tightening.""

A poll commissioned by the Bank of England, released earlier this month but conducted in May, showed that 42 percent of Britons expected a rate rise over the next 12 months - the highest proportion since May 2011.

Economists think British interest rates will start rising in the first quarter of 2015, according to a Reuters poll conducted on Friday, one day after Carney's speech.

LONDON Bank of England policymakers were surprised earlier this month that markets had not priced in a higher chance of an interest rate rise this year, minutes of their June meeting showed on Wednesday.

BoE Governor Mark Carney shocked markets last week when he said a rise in interest rates could come sooner than markets had been expecting, in comments that pushed sterling up towards a five-year high against the dollar.

That prompted traders to bring forward bets on when rates would rise to December of this year from around March 2015, though most economists think the first rate rise will be a few months later.

The minutes from the June 4-5 meeting showed that Carney's view on market rate expectations was shared more widely on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee.

Members were concerned that markets had underestimated the chance of stronger-than-expected growth in the second half of 2014 eating up spare capacity in the economy.

""In that context, the relatively low probability attached to a Bank Rate increase this year implied by some financial market prices was somewhat surprising,"" the minutes said.

Sterling inched lower on Wednesday and short-dated gilt yields fell as investors digested the minutes, with strategists saying they offered no clear advance on earlier comments from BoE policymakers.

All members of the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold at a record-low 0.5 percent. But as seen in May, some MPC members said the case for a rate rise was becoming more balanced.

""Assessing how the interest rate landscape may unfold remains uncertain,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.

""Further indications of a rapid tightening in labour market conditions could be a deciding factor over the rest of this year, with some of the more hawkish members of the MPC beginning to press for rate hikes relatively quickly.""

Martin Weale, known as one of the most hawkish members of the MPC, said on Tuesday that the amount of slack in the labour market may be smaller than the BoE forecast last month. This could cause unemployment to fall faster than the BoE currently forecast, putting upward pressure on wages and requiring tighter monetary policy, he said. GRADUAL HIKES

After the minutes and Weale's speech, the Confederation of British Industry said it was important that the central bank signal clearly when it would raise interest rates.

The minutes showed that the MPC still expected that rate rises, when they came, would be gradual and to a level well below their pre-crisis average.

The BoE said its staff maintained their forecast for 0.9 percent economic growth during the current quarter, and now saw upside risks to their forecast of 0.7 percent for the third quarter of 2014, due to strong survey data.

There were signs of a slowdown in housing market activity, but it was unclear if this was a temporary effect due to lenders getting accustomed to new mortgage rules, or if the rules and other factors were having a longer-term effect.

The MPC said that low interest rates created risks to financial stability from the housing market, but that these were best addressed by the BoE's Financial Policy Committee in the first instance.

The FPC is due to publish recommendations next week.

Some economists had speculated that at least one policymaker might have voted for a rate rise, after the sharp change in tone from BoE Governor Mark Carney last week.

But Britain does not face immediate inflation pressures, with the headline rate of consumer price inflation dropping to a 4-1/2 year low of 1.5 percent in May and wage growth even slower.

The MPC minutes said one explanation of the persistent weakness of wage growth could be that the economy has more slack in it than previously thought.

Most members of the MPC continued to think that the amount of slack was equivalent to 1-1.5 percent of economic output, but said this estimate was uncertain.

Carney has also previously noted that the economy faced headwinds from high indebtedness, a strong currency and weak export markets, and some analysts think markets have overestimated the chance of an early rate move.

NEW YORK The dollar edged up and U.S. Treasuries prices fell on Tuesday as rising U.S. inflation drove speculation that the Federal Reserve, which is meeting this week, may raise interest rates sooner than global investors have been expecting.

Wall Street stocks rose modestly, as investors shrugged off the turmoil in Iraq and kept an eye on the Fed as it began its two-day policy meeting.

The S&P 500 ended near its record high after three days of gains. The inflation data helped bank shares, with the S&P Financial index up just shy of 1 percent.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.48 points or 0.16 percent, to end at 16,808.49. The S&P 500 gained 4.21 points or 0.22 percent, to 1,941.99. The Nasdaq Composite added 16.13 points or 0.37 percent, at 4,337.23.

The U.S. Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month. The gain was the largest since February 2013 and topped expectations for a 0.2 percent rise, following a 0.3 percent advance in April.

""It was a much stronger print than the market was expecting, and many are thinking that may lead to a more hawkish tone tomorrow,” said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays in New York.

Fed officials are expected to trim their bond-buying program further at the conclusion of their meeting on Wednesday, although the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates until mid-2015.

The U.S. dollar rose, with the dollar index up 0.17 percent. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was ahead 0.29 percent at 102.13 yen.

""If the Fed decides to be less dovish, that could give a bid to the dollar,"" said currency strategist Sebastien Galy at Societe Generale in New York.

U.S. Treasuries' prices fell on the CPI data, which analysts said may give the Fed more confidence in accelerating an end of its ultra-low interest rate regime.

Benchmark 10-year notes fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.653 percent, up from 2.60 percent late on Monday. Thirty-year bonds dropped 27/32 in price to yield 3.443 percent, up from 3.40 percent.

Investors have been closely monitoring the situation in Iraq, worried that it could lead to sharply higher oil prices for an extended period.

""The Iraq situation could continue to destabilize markets, and there are a lot of unknown factors that could keep oil prices elevated. That said, valuations for stocks are not alarmingly high, and there aren't many alternatives for investors,"" said Bernard Baumohl, a managing director at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey.

Stocks on world markets were mixed. An index of European shares gained 0.3 percent, while the MSCI index of world stock markets added 0.1 percent.

Brent oil held steady above $113 per barrel, with Brent crude for August delivery up 41 cents to $113.36 per barrel. U.S. light crude was off 72 cents at $106.18.

U.S. gold futures' most-active contract slipped $4.80 to $1,270.40 an ounce.

NEW YORKThe U.S. dollar rose on Tuesday as news of a stronger-than-expected pickup in inflation supported the view the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner than some traders had thought.

Weaker price growth has hurt global growth. Earlier this month, the European Central Bank lowered a key rate into negative territory in an effort to avert deflation that could hobble the euro zone economy for years.

U.S. central bankers began a two-day meeting at which analysts expect they will further pare their bond purchase program and show no inclination to hike policy rates until the second half of 2015.

""If the Fed decides to be less dovish, that could give a bid to the dollar,"" said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.

On Tuesday, the government said the U.S. consumer price index, its broadest inflation gauge, rose 0.4 percent in May for its biggest increase in more than year.

The inflation news was mitigated by weaker-than-expected figures on domestic housing starts and lingering concerns about the fighting in Iraq and a gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, limiting the rise in the dollar, analysts said.

The greenback gained 0.28 percent against the yen at 102.14 yen, while the euro slipped 0.24 percent against the dollar at $1.3540.

The rise in the U.S. currency coincided with a rise in U.S bond yields in the wake of the surprisingly strong CPI report. The yield on two-year Treasuries earlier hit 0.488 percent, its highest since early April.

AUSSIE FALLS, POUND STEADYAmong other currencies, the Australian dollar was set for its biggest drop against the greenback in nearly a month after the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia expressed doubts as to whether the RBA had done enough to stimulate the economy.

The Aussie was 0.71 percent lower at $0.9334. Sterling retreated from a five-year high against the dollar after data showed U.K. inflation sagged to a 4-1/2-year low in May. They curbed the pound's surge on expectations the Bank of England could raise interest rates before year-end.

The pound was down 0.17 percent against the dollar at $1.6955 and 0.06 percent lower versus the euro at 79.88 pence respectively.

It rose above $1.70 for the first time since 2009 on Monday following comments from BOE Governor Mark Carney last Thursday the bank might raise rates sooner than expected.Traders said it may take a strong message from BOE minutes from its last policy meeting due Wednesday to lift the sterling back above $1.70.

""This recent inflation data will put a small dent in expectations for a rate hike this year,"" said Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at currency transfer platform UKForex in London.

BANGALORE The European Central Bank's latest offers for long-term cash won't revive lending in the region despite expectations for strong demand, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

ECB President Mario Draghi announced several new policies this month, including cutting interest rates to record lows and offering a new series of long-term loans known as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs).

But even with the new measures, economists saw a one-in-five chance of the euro zone slipping into deflation in the coming year, up from the 15 percent likelihood they predicted in a poll three months ago.

""On themselves, we don't expect the ECB measures to work miracles. They only tackle any potential liquidity shortages, but they don't provide capital relief for banks,"" said Elwin de Groot, economist at Rabobank.

All but six of the 36 economists who answered an extra question said they expected banks to borrow at least half the roughly 400 billion euros the ECB is offering, in the hope of encouraging more lending.

But a slim majority, 21 of 38 economists, do not expect that to boost lending in a meaningful way, suggesting the ECB needs to look beyond these measures to push up inflation.

On Monday, a further slowdown in euro zone inflation was confirmed - just 0.5 percent in May on the year - keeping them in the 'danger zone' of below 1 percent, half the ECB's mandate.

And inflation is not expected to rise above that danger zone at least until next year, according to the poll.

The ECB's own staff project consumer prices to rise just 0.7 percent in 2014 and 1.1 percent in 2015. It is projected to rise just 1.4 percent in 2016 - still below its target of below but close to 2 percent.

Although three euro zone countries - Greece, Portugal and Cyprus - are already seeing prices fall, ECB officials repeatedly have said there is no risk of this spreading to the entire region.

The poll respondents were unconvinced, however.

""On several dimensions, the euro zone economy is doing worse than Japan did in the 1990s ... which means that, despite recent ECB action, the risk of mild Japan-style deflation has not disappeared yet,"" wrote Martin van Vliet, senior economist at ING Financial Markets, in a note.

Another concern for the ECB is feeble economic growth, which dipped to a quarterly rate of 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year, half the expected pace.

Quarter-on-quarter economic growth is expected to run between 0.3 to 0.4 percent for the rest of the year.

LONDON The Bank of England will step up efforts to ensure bank customers and insurance policyholders suffer no loss of service if their lender or broker goes bust, its regulatory arm said.

Such efforts are seen as crucial by policymakers to avoid taxpayers having no choice but to bail out a failing bank or insurer in order to avoid huge disruption to customers.

The Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), formally launched last year to tighten supervision of financial firms, sketched out the plans in its annual report published on Tuesday.

For insurance, the watchdog said it was looking at ways policies might be transferred to another insurer to ensure seamless coverage for customers.

To better protect policyholders, it added it might need to adapt supervision from looking at an insurer in general, to putting particular focus on certain types of policies or policyholders.

The withdrawal of insurance, for example, would especially be a problem when cover is mandatory, such as car insurance for drivers and building insurance for mortgage-holders.

""Such a framework would suggest greater focus on compulsory insurance, any disruption to which would have an impact on the real economy, and long-term life insurance products which are difficult to transfer,"" the PRA report said.

The watchdog said it had also started work on ensuring Britain's deposit protection scheme paid out more quickly to customers when a lender fails.

Under existing rules, the aim is to pay out within seven days of a deposit-taking bank failing. However, regulators think this length of time could cause disruption to households that need to pay bills and buy food.

""Work has also progressed to explore how continuity of access to deposits can be provided in the event of a failure as an alternative to pay out,"" the PRA said.

The watchdog, which had 1,045 staff at the end of February, said it forced 33 of the firms it supervises to pay for reviews by an outside person - often from a big consultancy - to check internal controls, IT infrastructure or other parts of the business in the financial year that ended in April.

This was up from 27 in the prior year period, but the average cost per report was lower, it added.

LONDON JPMorgan Chase & Co was again ranked the top investment bank by revenue in the first quarter with $5.9 billion, according to a new survey published on Wednesday.

In a repeat of the previous year's results, the U.S. bank came ahead of rivals Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi, which all tied for second place, according to industry analytics firm Coalition.

Morgan Stanley finished sixth, while Barclays and Credit Suisse came joint seventh.

Coalition, which only gives revenue figures for the top-ranked bank in categories including equities and advisory, said that JPMorgan's investment banking revenue in the first quarter fell by almost 15 percent from $6.9 billion in the same period last year.

Most investment banks have seen trading revenues slump over the past year amid a low interest rate environment and tougher regulations requiring them to hold more capital, which have driven down returns.

A number are reducing their operations and cutting jobs as a result. Barclays said last month 7,000 jobs are to go at its investment bank and the head of investment banking at JPMorgan, Daniel Pinto, recently told Reuters that the bank would be ""laser-focused"" on cost cutting.

Coalition said turnover at JPMorgan's fixed income, commodities and currencies (FICC) division was $3.2 billion in the January to March period, down by more than a quarter from the previous year. The figure was enough to keep it in the top spot in Coalition's league table in FICC, alongside Deutsche Bank and Citi.

It also came joint first for equities revenues with fellow U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, earning $1.4 billion.

Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch came out on top in advisory. The two earned around $1.5 billion for their work assisting companies with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions.

Coalition tracks the performance of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS - the 10 largest investment banks globally.

Its rankings are based on public information such as banks' results and benchmarked to a common standard to produce a top 10 league table.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently removed language from an agency policy on granting regulatory waivers after an SEC official raised concerns it implied some companies are ""too big to fail.""

In an interview with Reuters, SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar said he convinced the agency to alter the language in April after he threatened to vote against approving a waiver for the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

The bank had requested the waiver to retain certain regulatory privileges, some of which make it easier for companies to raise capital, after one of its units struck a criminal plea deal in connection with the Libor bench mark interest rate manipulation case.

But Piwowar said he feared voting to approve it without first changing the policy language could lead the market to believe the bank was too big to fail.

That is because the policy originally called for the SEC to consider a company's ""significance to the markets and its connectedness to other market participants"" as a factor when deciding whether to deny a waiver.

The SEC quietly made the change he requested on April 24.

Afterwards, commissioners voted to approve the RBS waiver in a split 3-2 vote, with Democrats Kara Stein and Luis Aguilar voting against it.

""The policy removed 'too big to fail' as an explicit factor,"" Piwowar said in an interview late on Monday. ""I am not comfortable having 'too big to fail' entrenched in a commission policy to grant waivers to anyone.""

Lawmakers and multiple regulatory agencies have taken steps to minimize the perception that some companies are ""too big to fail"" after taxpayers were forced to bail out mega banks during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

The interconnectedness language is only one part of the SEC's regulatory waiver policy that has come under fire in recent months.

Most of the controversy has been focused on questions raised in April by Stein, who issued a scathing dissent on the RBS waiver.

Stein said she felt granting a waiver to RBS following a severe criminal violation was creating a ""too big to bar"" policy that rewards banks with regulatory privileges despite their bad behaviour.

The main type of waiver at the heart of the debate is known as a ""well-known seasoned issuer"" or ""WKSI"" waiver.

A WKSI is a coveted tag that lets companies raise money immediately through securities offerings without having to wait for SEC approval. Companies that break criminal laws or civil anti-fraud laws can lose the status, unless they apply for a waiver from the SEC.

Stein's comments have since touched a nerve among Democratic lawmakers and some of her fellow SEC commissioners with differing views on the subject.

Some of Stein's concerns were addressed in one other change made to the agency's internal policy on April 24 after language was added requiring companies with criminal or civil fraud violations to show ""good cause"" for why they should get a waiver.",U.S. SEC alters waiver policy to remove 'too big to fail' concern,http://uk.reuters.com,[Sarah N],https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140617&t=2&i=909377115&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA5G15J,2014-06-17 00:00:00,en,http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/17/uk-sec-waiver-piwowar-idUKKBN0ES2XK20140617
912,"LONDON Citigroup's global head of foreign exchange Jeff Feig is to leave the bank, it said on Tuesday, a second major change at the top of the currency trading operations at the world's single largest FX dealer.

""Given his tenure in his role, his departure was well-anticipated, and part of the natural cycle of the business,"" a Citigroup spokesman told Reuters. ""We have a strong, talented bench that continues to support this core business.""

Feig had been with the bank since 1989. His spokesperson declined to comment.

The bank had already announced the departure of another global head of its FX business, Anil Prasad, in February.

There was no indication Feig's departure was related to the global investigation into alleged manipulation of the fixing benchmarks.

According to Euromoney magazine's last poll, Citigroup sees almost 16 percent of the estimated $5.3 trillion (3.12 trillion pounds) a day that passes across the world's largest financial market.

Spot currency trading volumes in general have fallen sharply this year, however, cooled by falling market volatility in an era of universally low interest rates and, some say, the impact of the ""fixing"" investigation on traders.

As the investigation has intensified globally since being formally launched by U.S. and UK authorities in October last year, around 40 FX traders at many of the world's biggest banks have been suspended or fired - including some at Citigroup.

In most cases it is unclear whether the suspensions or departures are linked to the investigation.

914,"LONDON New British bank TSB will be valued at 1.3 billion pounds or more when it lists on the stock market this week after its parent Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) lifted the minimum price it will sell shares at, people familiar with the matter said.

Lloyds has narrowed the price range for the sale of a 25 percent stake in TSB to between 250 pence and 270 pence, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. One source said the sale was ""well-oversubscribed"" within that range.

The new range values the business at a minimum of 1.3 billion pounds or 0.8 times its book, or net asset, value. It was originally priced at between 220 pence and 290 pence per share, or between 0.7 and 0.9 times its book value, valuing the business at a minimum of 1.1 billion pounds.

Lloyds, which is 25 percent-owned by the government, was ordered to sell the 631 branches which form TSB by European regulators as a condition for their approval of state aid received by the bank during the financial crisis.

The IPO was initially priced conservatively, reflecting a cooling of investor interest in UK company flotations in recent weeks. But one source said investor appetite had increased after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney indicated UK interest rates could rise sooner than financial markets expect, potentially boosting the bank's profitability.

TSB's IPO prospectus showed the bank had achieved only modest profits over the past 3 years. It made an underlying profit of 172 million pounds last year, compared with 28 million in 2012 and 57 million in 2011.

The shares are due to start trading on Friday. The sales book is due to close on Thursday, after which the final price will be set.

Analysts said Amazon has more opportunities outside the United States. Only 30 percent of the 5.2 billion phones on the market are smartphones, Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony said in a June 5 research note.

""As the world shifts toward mobile, how do you make sure Amazon is front and center?"" Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting, said in an interview.

Two sources have said the device contains 3D features visible to the eye without special glasses. Analysts expect Amazon's Prime membership program, which offers features such as movie streaming and two-day delivery, to be tied to the phone.

A phone would represent yet another new area for Amazon, which got its start selling books and has since expanded into everything from original television shows to grocery delivery. It could also boost adoption of an Amazon payments platform.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported AT&T Inc (T.N) would carry the smartphone exclusively, as it did the iPhone for years and a short-lived Facebook (FB.O) phone made by HTC Corp (2498.TW) that at one point was discounted to 99 cents.

""Let's hope @amazon doesn't fall victim to the @att curse that is the facebook phone,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeted.

A phone would be the third new device Amazon has introduced this year after its FireTV streaming video device and Dash grocery-ordering wand. In recent years, the company has moved more aggressively into hardware, selling its devices at cost in hopes of spurring purchases on Amazon's website.

It has also used its devices to test emerging markets. This year, Amazon began selling the Kindle online in Brazil after years of selling the device in stores. The move gives Amazon a chance to work through some of the country's logistics problems.

DUBLIN Ireland's High Court on Wednesday asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to review a European Union-U.S. data protection agreement in light of allegations that Facebook FB.O shared data from EU users with the U.S. National Security Agency.

It asked the European Court to clarify whether a Safe Harbour deal, which allows the transfer of data from EU consumers to the United States, was compatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The judge was ruling on a request by Austrian student group europe-v-facebook for an investigation into allegations that companies including Apple AAPL.O and Facebook help the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) harvest email and other private data from European citizens.

The group appealed to the High Court after the Irish data watchdog - the effective supervisor of the EU activities of some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies which have their European headquarters in Ireland - had said in July there were no grounds for such an investigation.

High Court Justice Gerard Hogan said that given the Safe Harbour agreement, which says that U.S. has sufficient data safeguards in place, the Irish regulator did not have the authority to investigate.

If Safe Harbour stands, the student group's application must fail, he said. ""The critical issue which arises is whether the proper interpretation of the 1995 [EU data protection] directive and the 2000 Commission decision [on the Safe Harbour principles] should be re-evaluated in the light of the subsequent entry into force of article 8 of the EU charter,"" on the right to the protection of personal data, Hogan said.

The Safe Harbour agreement allows U.S. companies like Facebook, Google GOOGL.O, and Microsoft MSFT.O to gather customer information in Europe and send it to the United States, beyond the EU's legal jurisdiction, as long as certain criteria are met.

The strength of the agreement was called into question by the revelation by U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden last year that the NSA used major Web companies, including Apple AAPL.O, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, to gather user data as part of a mass electronic surveillance programme known as Prism.

""The whole Prism, NSA spying thing is thereby in front of the highest court in Europe, which is going to be very interesting,"" Max Schrems, founder of europe-v-facebook, the Austrian lobby group which brought the case, said.

""Any ruling will apply to any other U.S. companies that have participated in PRISM,"" he said, adding that he thought there was a ""very good chance"" of having Safe Harbour overturned.

EU countries are negotiating a new data protection law which would oblige companies like Google or Facebook to seek consent before using personal information, and would impose stiff fines if they break the rules.

""If Safe Harbour were to come falling down, that would create an immediate issue for the thousands of multinationals who have self-certified with that system,"" Rob Corbet, head of technology and innovation at Arthur Cox law firm in Dublin, said.

""However, nobody wants that uncertainty so I think the more likely outcome is that the U.S. and Europe will get their act together and reach a political outcome on data transfers prior to any final ECJ ruling.”

A referral from a Spanish court led the European Court last month to rule that internet companies can be made to remove irrelevant or excessive personal information from search engine results in a case that pitted privacy campaigners against Google.

TORONTO BlackBerry Ltd reached a licensing deal with Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday that will let the Canadian smartphone maker offer some 240,000 Android applications from Amazon's app store on its lineup of BlackBerry 10 devices this fall.

The move allows the Waterloo, Ontario-based company to add a vast array of consumer-focused apps to its devices, while at the same time directing its own efforts toward developing enterprise and productivity applications.

Customers who own smartphones powered by its BlackBerry 10 operating system will now be able to access popular Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Minecraft and Candy Crush Saga on their BlackBerry devices this fall. Google Inc makes Android, the mobile operating system used in more than a billion phones and tablets.

The apps will become available after the Canadian smartphone maker rolls out the upgraded BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the company said.

The move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as it attempts to reinvent itself under new Chief Executive Officer John Chen as BlackBerry phones have lost ground to Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices.

Analysts saw the move as a step in the right direction, but are not sure whether it will help turn the tide for BlackBerry.

""While this will widen the BB10 app ecosystem, the consumer

smartphone environment still remains challenging,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a note to clients.

Um views the announcement as a positive for BlackBerry, but said ""whether it stems consumer churn remains to be seen.""

Chen wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine communications. The company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automotive industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars.

BlackBerry already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients, including corporations and government agencies, to manage and secure mobile devices on their internal networks.

Chen intends to build on those ties and BlackBerry's security credentials to let these enterprise clients build and customize in-house corporate and productivity applications for their employees.

Last week, BlackBerry announced a deal with EnStream LP, a mobile payments joint venture owned by Canada's three large wireless carriers, to provide a secure platform for transactions between banks and consumers.

These moves, coupled with others made by Chen, including a much cheered move to forge an alliance with device manufacturing giant Foxconn Technology Co, have made analysts more optimistic about BlackBerry's prospects.

Following the announcement of the Amazon deal on Wednesday, BGC Partners upgraded its rating on BlackBerry shares to ""buy"" from ""sell,"" and lifted its price target on the stock.

BGC analyst Colin Gillis credited the upgrade to Chen's moves to cut costs, forge partnerships and focus in core markets.

Shares of BlackBerry, which reports quarterly results early on Thursday, jumped 3 percent close at $8.29 on the Nasdaq.

TAIPEI Taiwan's Acer Inc on Wednesday said it has appointed co-founder and board member George Huang as new chairman, tasked with overseeing the recovery of the PC maker's near-dominant position in a shrinking industry.

The appointment was announced after Acer's annual general investor meeting. It followed the retirement of co-founder Stan Shih, who returned to the company in November to lead a restructuring effort that welcomed a new chief executive and chief financial officer.

The company also announced that they have invited Shih to take the up the role of honorary chairman. At the meeting, Shih said without elaborating that he would continue to participate in Acer's reform.

HONG KONG An advisory council to the Hong Kong government has recommended a raft of possible reforms to the city's IPO regime, including considering a change to the ""one-share-one-vote"" rule that cost the city the listing of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.

The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) said in the report issued on Wednesday that Hong Kong's government and regulators should consider revisiting the rule, which prevents companies with unusual ownership structures from listing in the city.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd filed in the United States last month for an initial public offering (IPO) expected to raise more than $15 billion.

Alibaba's decision to list in the U.S. was a blow to Hong Kong's bourse, operated by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. HKEx was initially Alibaba's preferred IPO venue, but the city's regulators balked at any potential violation of the ""one-share-one-vote"" principle.

The FSDC was set up by Hong Kong's government in January 2013 to examine how the city could maintain its status as a major Asian financial hub amid competition from regional rivals.

Its report on Wednesday also drew attention to HKEx's need to attract more international listings. In 2012 the city attracted just two offerings from overseas companies, while last year the only such deal came from a Chinese-owned company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

Mt Gox was once the world's leading exchange for trading the digital currency, but shut its website earlier this year after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins - worth more than $500 million at current prices - in a hacking attack.

It subsequently said it found 200,000 bitcoins.

The company filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in March to prevent U.S. customers who had filed a class action lawsuit from seizing its U.S. assets, such as computer servers, and demanding evidence and access to Mt Gox executives.

Since then, the company and the class action plaintiffs reached a settlement, which is awaiting final approval by a federal court in Chicago.

Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas granted recognition of the Chapter 15 case, which allows Mt Gox's foreign representative to file lawsuits and pursue potential funds to repay creditors.

Under the deal, U.S. and Canadian customers will split the 200,000 bitcoins held by Mt. Gox and share in a 16.5 percent stake after Mt. Gox is sold.

Sunlot, a firm backed by child actor-turned entrepreneur Brock Pierce and venture capitalist William Quigley, has proposed buying Mt Gox for one bitcoin, or around $600.

SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc's YouTube said on Tuesday that it plans to launch a paid streaming music service, amid criticism that its existing, free video website might block the music videos of labels that do not agree to its terms.

YouTube has partnered with ""hundreds of major and independent"" music labels for the new service, the company said in a statement, confirming long-running rumors that the world's most popular online video website will offer a paid music service.

The news comes as some music trade groups have criticized YouTube's plans to potentially block the content of certain labels from appearing on YouTube's free, ad-supported Website unless they sign deals to participate in the new, subscription streaming music service. The deals that YouTube is offering are on ""highly unfavorable, and non-negotiable terms,"" according to a news release issued by the Worldwide Independent Music Industry Network last month.

YouTube declined to comment on the terms of the deals, but said in a statement that the new service would provide new revenue for the music industry.

""We’re adding subscription-based features for music on YouTube with this in mind - to bring our music partners new revenue streams in addition to the hundreds of millions of dollars YouTube already generates for them each year,"" YouTube said in a statement.

YouTube has already signed deals for the paid service with 95 percent of the music labels that it previously had deals with for its existing, ad-supported music video website, a person familiar with the matter said. Blocking certain music labels' videos from appearing on YouTube's free website might be necessary in order to provide a consistent user experience for the paid service, the person said.

The YouTube service is expected to launch at the end of the summer and will allow users to listen to music without any ads, according to a person familiar with the situation. Among the other features expected are the ability to listen to music offline and the ability to listen to an artist's entire album instead of just individual songs, as is currently the case on YouTube, the person said.

Streaming music services such as Spotify and Pandora are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, as digital music downloads decline. Apple Inc announced plans to acquire streaming music service and premium headphone maker Beats for $3 billion last month.

Google launched the $9.99-per-month Play All Access subscription music service in 2013. The forthcoming YouTube paid music service could potentially work in coordination with the Play service so that consumers aren't forced to subscribe to two separate services, the person familiar with the situation said.

""These results reflect Adobe is continuing to execute well through its transition to the cloud, which continues to be a key ingredient in the company's long-term recipe for success,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Samad Samana told Reuters.

Adobe said in March it would phase out the traditional box license versions of its Creative Suite 6 and offer the software only on a web-based subscription model.

Subscription models bring in less money upfront, but they usually ensure more predictable recurring revenue.

Adobe said it added 464,000 paid Creative Cloud subscribers in the second quarter ended May 30, ending the quarter with 2.3 million paid subscribers.

The company said it expects to have 3.3 million subscribers of its Creative Cloud suite at the end of fiscal 2014, up from its earlier forecast of 3 million.

Creative Cloud suite includes Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash software.

FBR Capital's Samana said Adobe's strong uptick in net new subscriber additions indicates that customers are increasingly seeing the value of the Creative Cloud offering, the engine of growth for the company’s digital media business.

""All key metrics were above consensus and the company's transition to subscriptions is proceeding well ahead of plan,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi told Reuters.

The company offers Creative Cloud and document services under its digital media unit, while its digital marketing unit offers marketing analytics tools, document management and web conferencing software.

934,"WASHINGTON/BUENOS AIRES The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear Argentina’s appeal over its battle with hedge funds that refused to take part in its debt restructurings, an unexpected move that risks toppling Latin America's No 3 economy into a new default.

The high court left intact lower court rulings that ordered Argentina to pay $1.33 billion to the so-called holdouts who refused 2005 and 2010 debt swaps in the wake of its catastrophic 2001-02 default on $100 billion.

This could open the door to claims from other holdouts worth as much as $15 billion, a hefty sum for a slowing economy struggling with rapidly dwindling foreign reserves.

The news triggered a nosedive in Argentine stocks and bonds after investors expected the court to delay its decision and give Argentina time to negotiate with holdouts or restructure its exchange bonds outside of New York legislation.

The impact on global markets was muted given the country's economic isolation since its default.

Argentina has previously refused to pay up. It argues it does not have the funds and cannot give holdouts preferential treatment over exchange bondholders after many of them bought the debt at a massive discount and are claiming payback in full.

If it sticks to that position, U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa could prevent full payment to exchange bondholders even though the country is able and willing to pay them.

This could result in a default by June 30, when payments are due on discount bonds governed by New York, further setting back Argentina's return to international capital markets.

""It's a very damaging scenario for Argentina,"" said Marco Lavagna at Ecolatina consultancy, noting that how lower courts implemented their rulings was key. ""Maybe something could open up there and allow for negotiation.

Argentina hinted last month it might consider negotiating with holdouts but could not do so until December 31 of this year when a clause in its debt swaps prohibiting it from offering holdouts better terms expires.

Whether Argentina can keep stalling investors and U.S. courts until that date remains to be seen.

Argentine stocks .MERV were down 7.3 percent by 1730 GMT, while the U.S. dollar-denominated benchmark 2033 Discount bonds ARGGLB33=RR fell 7.86 points in price to bid 75.010. Siobhan Morden, New York-based head of Latin American strategy at Jefferies LLC, said the market reaction was relatively mild as investors waited to see how the government would respond.

The government was not immediately available for comment on Monday but state-run news agency Telam said President Cristina Fernandez would deliver a televised address on Monday night.

The decision comes at an unfortunate time for Argentina which has been trying to normalize relations with foreign investors and creditors in order to regain access to international funds.

A DOUBLE BLOW

Argentina wants to avoid making full payment to holdouts led by hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and NML Capital Ltd, a unit of billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp, that Fernandez has slated as ""vultures"".

Creditors holding about 93 percent of Argentina's bonds agreed to participate in the two debt swaps in 2005 and 2010, accepting between 25 and 29 cents on the dollar.

Some groups such as the IMF, the Washington-based global lender, have said they are worried a ruling against Argentina will make it more difficult for other countries to restructure their debt and put financial calamity behind them.

""This is surprising because it is giving a precedent for any 'vulture fund' to go against any country, so any country is vulnerable in a restructure,"" said Sebastian Centurion at ABC Exchange.

Others say collective action clauses that are now broadly used now in sovereign debt issuance should prevent Argentina's particular case becoming a precedent. Emerging markets did not react to the news of the Supreme Court decision.

In a double blow to Argentina on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court also ruled that creditors can seek information about Argentina's non-U.S. assets in a case about bank subpoenas that is part of the country's decade-long litigation with holdouts.

The question was whether NML could enforce subpoenas against Bank of America and Banco de la Nacion Argentina. The court's ruling may nonetheless have limited impact in part because of Argentina's limited assets around the world.

NML has in the past pursued Argentine assets aggressively in its fight to get full repayment for its bonds, in 2012 even seizing an Argentine navy ship in Ghana.

On the issue of paying bondholders, Argentina had said in its most recent court filing that the government would struggle to pay the bondholders in full while also serving its restructured debt.

In that scenario, ""Argentina will have to face, objectively, a serious and imminent risk of default,"" the filing said.

The bondholders dispute that assessment, saying in their own court filing there was evidence presented in lower courts that Argentina could afford to pay.

""We are reviewing the decisions from the Supreme Court today and what the next steps might be, but we have no other comment at this time,"" a spokesman for NML told Reuters.

WASHINGTON The hot question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold blooded like reptiles, fish and amphibians finally has a good answer.

Dinosaurs, for eons Earth's dominant land animals until being wiped out by an asteroid 65 million years ago, were in fact somewhere in between.

Scientists said on Thursday they evaluated the metabolism of numerous dinosaurs using a formula based on their body mass as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones and their growth rates as shown by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees.

The study, published in the journal Science, assessed 21 species of dinosaurs including super predators Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, long-necked Apatosaurus, duckbilled Tenontosaurus and bird-like Troodon as well as a range of mammals, birds, bony fish, sharks, lizards, snakes and crocodiles.

""Our results showed that dinosaurs had growth and metabolic rates that were actually not characteristic of warm-blooded or even cold-blooded organisms. They did not act like mammals or birds nor did they act like reptiles or fish,"" said University of Arizona evolutionary biologist and ecologist Brian Enquist.

""Instead, they had growth rates and metabolisms intermediate to warm-blooded and cold-blooded organisms of today. In short, they had physiologies that are not common in today's world.""

There has been a long-standing debate about whether dinosaurs were slow, lumbering cold-blooded animals - as scientists first proposed in the 19th century - or had a uniquely advanced, more warm-blooded physiology.

As scientists unearthed remains of more and more fast-looking dinosaurs like Velociraptor, some championed the idea dinosaurs were as active and warm–blooded as mammals and birds. The realization that birds arose from small feathered dinosaurs seemed to support that view.

University of New Mexico biologist John Grady said the idea that creatures must be either warm-blooded or cold-blooded is too simplistic when looking over the vast expanse of time. Like dinosaurs, some animals alive today like the great white shark, leatherback sea turtle and tuna do not fit easily into either category, Grady added.

""A better answer would be 'in the middle.' By examining animal growth and rates of energy use, we were able to reconstruct a metabolic continuum, and place dinosaurs along that continuum. Somewhat surprisingly, dinosaurs fell right in the middle,"" Grady said.

The researchers called creatures with this medium-powered metabolism mesotherms, as contrasted to ectotherms (cold–blooded animals with low metabolic rates that do not produce much heat and bask in the sun to warm up) and endotherms (warm–blooded animals that use heat from metabolic reactions to maintain a high, stable body temperature).

Grady said an intermediate metabolism may have allowed dinosaurs to get much bigger than any mammal ever could. Warm–blooded animals need to eat a lot so they are frequently hunting or munching on plants. ""It is doubtful that a lion the size of T. rex could eat enough to survive,"" Grady said.

938,"SANTIAGO The arrival of the 66th and final giant antenna at the world's largest land-based space observatory in the Chilean desert will allow the endeavor to better probe the mysteries of the universe, the project's director said on Tuesday.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array's (ALMA) antennae are situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau, a remote area of the Atacama desert in northern Chile at 16,400 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. There, the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky.

With all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope, the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the ""cold universe"" where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered, said project director Pierre Cox. He added that ALMA is poised to reach its full potential next year.

""Up to now ALMA's observations and data were published with 16 to 20 antennae, now we're going to have double that or more, hence there will be a jump in sensitivity: better, quicker and more data,"" Cox said. ""I think there will be a real stream of scientific results in the coming months and years.""

The new 12-meter (13-yard) diameter dish is the 25th European antenna to be transported up to the observatory. It will work alongside 25 other antennae from North America and four from East Asia, as well as 12 smaller 7-meter (7.7-yard) dishes from East Asia.

The $1.1 billion telescope, which began full-scale operation in March, has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the center of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. It also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star.

ALMA is funded by the European Union, the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Japan.

WASHINGTON If you want to find Earth's vast reservoirs of water, you may have to look beyond the obvious places like the oceans and polar ice caps.

Scientists on Friday said massive amounts of water appear to exist deep beneath the planet's surface, trapped in a rocky layer of the mantle at depths between 250 miles and 410 miles (410 km to 660 km).

But do not expect to quench your thirst down there. The water is not liquid - or any other familiar form like ice or vapor. It is locked inside the molecular structure of minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite in mantle rock that possesses the remarkable ability to absorb water like a sponge.

""It may equal or perhaps be larger than the amount of water in the oceans,"" Northwestern University geophysicist Steve Jacobsen said in a telephone interview. ""It alters our thoughts about the composition of the Earth.""

""It's no longer liquid water that we're talking about at these great depths. The weight of hundreds of kilometers of rock and very high temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 Fahrenheit) break down water into its components. And it's not accessible. It's not a resource in any way,"" Jacobsen added.

Jacobsen said water is taken down into the mantle with minerals during the process known as plate tectonics - the slow, inexorable movement of the colossal rock slabs that make up the Earth's surface.

When the minerals containing this water reach certain depths, they break down in a process called dehydration and release the water to form magmas. Such ""dehydration melting"" is common in the shallow mantle and forms the source for magmas in many volcanoes.

In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers present evidence that this is also occurring much deeper in the mantle in a region called the ""transition zone"" between Earth's upper and lower mantle.

The study combined lab experiments involving synthetic ringwoodite being exposed to conditions simulating the heat and pressure of the ""transition zone"" and observations of events in this zone based on seismic data from a network of more than 2,000 seismometers across the United States.

A team led by Jacobsen and University of New Mexico seismologist Brandon Schmandt identified deep pockets of magma, a likely signature of the presence of water at those depths.

""Melting of rock at this depth is remarkable because most melting in the mantle occurs much shallower, in the upper 50 miles (80 km),"" Schmandt said in a statement. ""If there is a substantial amount of H2O in the transition zone, then some melting should take place in areas where there is flow into the lower mantle, and that is consistent with what we found.""

The research built on another study in March showing that a commercially worthless diamond found in Brazil contained ringwoodite that entrapped water amounting to more than 1 percent of its weight. Ringwoodite has been found in meteorites, but this was the first terrestrial sample because it normally is so deeply buried.

942,"ALBUQUERQUE N.M. A fossil mastodon skull found by a group attending a bachelor party at a New Mexico lakeshore is more than 10 million years old and will take at least six months to clean, a museum paleontologist said on Friday.

The partygoers stumbled across the skull this week, complete with its tusks, buried in sand at Elephant Butte State Park, about 155 miles (250 km) south of Albuquerque.

Gary Morgan, curator and head paleontologist at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, led a team that spent some six hours on Thursday carefully excavating the fossil, which was buried in about four feet (1.2 meters) of lake silt.

When it emerged, it was found to measure approximately five feet by three feet (1.5 by 1 meters) and weighed more than 1,000 pounds (450 kg).

""This mastodon find is older than the woolly mammoth that tread the Earth in the Ice Age. ... It probably died on a sandbar of the ancient Rio Grande River,"" Morgan told Reuters.

""I've been here for 20 years and have never seen something like this before.""

Mastodons were relatives of the elephant that stood 10 feet (3 meters) tall and migrated to North America some 15 million years ago. They ranged across the continent with saber tooth tigers, giant sloths and American camels before becoming extinct about 10,000 years ago.

Morgan said the unusual discovery came to light after some water was drained from the Elephant Butte Lake two weeks ago to provide irrigation for parts of southern New Mexico and Texas.

He said the meticulous process of cleaning the fossil would now likely take his team some six months before they could then begin examining it more closely.

The museum will put the fossil on public display, he said, but probably not for a year while those studies take place.

""This is too important to keep stored in the back,"" he said.

WASHINGTON Eucalyptus leaves are the main food supply for Australia's koalas, but there is a lot more to the tree than that.

It is native to Australia but has become the world's most widely planted hardwood tree. The eucalyptus tree is a source of timber, fuel, cellulose and medicinal and industrial oils, and scientists are looking to maximize its potential in biofuels.

An international team of researchers this week unveiled the genetic blueprint of the tree species Eucalyptus grandis and identified among its 36,000-plus genes the ones involved in critical biological processes controlling tree growth and wood formation, flowering and other qualities.

""The main interest is understanding how these trees grow so fast and how they are able to produce such large amounts of cellulose,"" scientist Zander Myburg of the University of Pretoria's Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute said in a telephone interview on Thursday.

""There's an interest in cellulose in the context of breaking the cellulose down into sugars, which can be fermented into biofuels. But really these trees are widely used industrially for cellulose-related products and timber, pulp and paper production.""

Also called gum trees, eucalyptus trees have grown for tens of millions of years across the Australian landscape, and are closely identified with that continent. The koala, one of Australia's characteristic marsupials, munches its leaves. Its wood also is used in making the Australian aboriginal wind instruments called didgeridoos.

Eucalyptus trees, with their speedy growth rate and exceptional wood and fiber properties, are now grown in about 100 countries on six continents.

Some scientists see great potential in these trees as a biomass energy crop. The study identified genes controlling the final steps for the production of cellulose and ""hemi-cellulose"", both carbohydrates that can be used for biofuel production.

""We have a keen interest in how wood is formed,"" added Gerald Tuskan of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, another of the lead researchers.

""A major determinant of industrial processing efficiency lies in the composition and cross-linking of biopolymers in the thick secondary cell walls of woody fibers. Our analysis provides a much more comprehensive understanding of the genetic control of carbon allocation towards cell wall biopolymers in woody plants - a crucial step toward the development of future biomass crops,"" Tuskan said in a statement.

The study was published in the journal Nature.

WASHINGTON This is certainly not just another fish tale.

A tiny jawless fish that lived more than half a billion years ago is providing scientists with a treasure trove of information about the very dawn of vertebrate life on Earth.

Researchers on Wednesday described about 100 fossil specimens of the fish unearthed at the Burgess Shale site in the Canadian Rockies and other locales, many exquisitely preserved showing the primitive body structures that would later evolve into jaws.

The fish, Metaspriggina, lived about 515 to 500 million years ago amid the astonishing flourishing of complex life during the Cambrian Period. While two fragmentary specimens had been found previously, the new ones revealed unprecedented detail about one of the earliest known vertebrates.

Creatures like Metaspriggina began the lineage of vertebrates - animals with backbones - that later would include the whole range of jawed fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals including people.

""It allows an understanding of where we come from and what our most distant relatives might have looked like,"" said Jean-Bernard Caron, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. ""Because of its great age - more than half a billion year old - Metaspriggina provides a deep down view at the origins of the vertebrates.""

Metaspriggina was a soft-bodied jawless fish no bigger than a person's thumb - about 2-1/2 inches (6 cm) long, with a small head, a narrow, tapering body, a pair of large eyes atop the head and a pair of small nasal sacs.

It did not have bones but possessed a skull possibly made of cartilage as well as precursors to vertebrae and a skeletal rod called a ""notochord"" that provided body support like backbones would do in later vertebrates. It is unclear if it had fins.

The scientists were especially excited about the gill structure of the fish because of the preview it gives to the anatomy of later vertebrates - paving the way for the jaws that would open a world of possibilities for so many later creatures.

Metaspriggina boasted seven pairs of rod-like structures called gill arches, or branchial arches, that functioned for both filtration of food particles and respiration. The first pair of these gill arches was more robust than the others and presaged the first step in the evolution of jaws, Caron said.

Scientists have known about the importance of these arches in the evolution of vertebrates but had never before been able to see such an early example.

""Metaspriggina is important because it both fills an important gap in our understanding of the early evolution of the group to which we belong, but in particular shows with remarkable clarity the arrangement of the so-called branchial arches,"" University of Cambridge paleontologist Simon Conway Morris said.

Part of the jaw bones eventually evolved into tiny middle ear bones in mammals, Caron added, noting that the evolution of these arches ""had a profound impact on how vertebrates look, live and function today.""

The study was published in the journal Nature.

948,"ALBUQUERQUE A group of men attending a bachelor party stumbled across a rare fossil of a mastodon skull, complete with its tusks, in sand at a lakeshore in a New Mexico state park, a museum spokesman said on Thursday.

Randall Gann of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science said the partygoers discovered the fossil earlier this week in Elephant Butte State Park, an area of arid hills surrounding a reservoir about 155 miles (250 km) south of Albuquerque.

He said the museum's head paleontologist was amazed by the find, calling it ""the most complete mastodon skull with attached tusks he has seen in 20 years.""

Mastodons were Ice Age relatives of the elephant that stood 10 feet (3 meters) tall and migrated to North America some 15 million years ago. They ranged across the continent with saber tooth tigers, giant sloths and American camels, before becoming extinct about 10,000 years ago.

The revelers who made the discovery first contacted a professor at the University of New Mexico, who then put them in touch with the museum's head paleontologist Gary Morgan.

Gann said scientists from the museum planned to act quickly.

""Because it is in sand and not buried in rock, Dr. Morgan feels he can excavate the skull, cast it, and remove it today,"" the spokesman said.Shannon Parill, an employee of Elephant Butte State Park, said it was surprising the fossil was found in such a popular area, which attracts thousands of outdoor enthusiasts every year with its boating, hiking, fishing and camping opportunities.

Beth Wojahn, spokeswoman for New Mexico's Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, praised the group involved.

""What is noteworthy is the men who found the skull did not disturb it and called the right people,"" Wojahn said.

CHICAGO A new way of evaluating tumors may soon help cancer patients identify the underlying genetic link to their disease - and the best possible treatment – all in a single test.

Researchers are set to begin clinical trials using a more comprehensive testing method that looks for all of the known genes that may be active in a tumor.

The new method could guide patients to the right drug earlier, potentially replacing current tests known as companion diagnostics that only look for a specific biological trait or “biomarker.” The presence of a biomarker can predict whether a new class of drugs called targeted therapies will work on particular tumors.

Results of these broader tests could even be used to quickly identify which patients might benefit from experimental drugs being tested in clinical trials. U.S. health officials see it as the future direction of cancer diagnostics.

""We really are moving away from this one drug, one biomarker, one companion diagnostic,"" said Dr Richard Pazdur, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's oncology chief.

In advanced melanoma, for example, about half of patients' tumors have a mutation in the BRAF gene. Roche makes a drug called Zelboraf that blocks that pathway, at least for a time. To get Roche's drug, patients need to be evaluated with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test. One of the tests is also made by Roche.

In many cases, the FDA requires single-biomarker companion diagnostics as part of the drug approval process, but the broader testing model opens the door to additional players in the diagnostics space, including U.S.-based Foundation Medicine Inc and Thermo Fisher’s Life Technologies.

In a trial starting later this month, for example, patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung could be recommended for one of five experimental treatments based on which genes are active. Foundation Medicine's next-generation sequencing platform will be used to screen some 6,000 lung cancer patients over five years.

The Lung Master Protocol trial, also known as Lung-MAP, will take place in some 400 research centers. It is a public-private partnership between the National Cancer Institute, Amgen Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and its U.S.-based biotech arm MedImmune, Roche's Genentech unit and Pfizer Inc.

A similar effort called the National Lung Matrix trial being organized in Britain by AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Cancer Research UK is set to start taking patients in July or August.[ID:nL6N0N63N5] Pazdur said a conference this fall will also discuss plans for a trial in metastatic breast cancer.

""This is a new paradigm in many, many ways,"" said Ellen Sigal, chairperson and founder of Friends of Cancer Research, which is organizing the U.S. lung cancer trial. ""We're revolutionizing not only the genetic testing but how patients get into a trial.""

ONE TISSUE, MANY TESTS

Dr Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development for Pfizer's cancer business, said having a single test looking for a single biological marker made sense when there were only a few targeted cancer drugs, which exploit specific weaknesses in patients’ tumors.

""In the past 10 years, we've now identified many more potential targets of drugs, and these molecules are involved in critical functions of a cancer cell,"" he said. ""Now it becomes very relevant that we be able to go beyond that one tissue, one test to one tissue, many tests.""

In non-small cell lung cancer, for example, there are more than a dozen different molecular abnormalities that are known to influence tumor growth.

Dr Vince Miller, Foundation Medicine's chief medical officer, said as more of the drugs win approval, doctors might need to run five to eight tests, all from a tiny scrap of tumor.

""Tissue scarcity was becoming a very real issue,"" he said.

It's an issue that Dr. Tadd Lazarus, chief medical officer at Germany's Qiagen NV, knows about personally.

Lazarus' father is battling his second round of lung cancer, and biopsies must be done using a long needle, a process that produces only a tiny tissue sample. ""You get a fixed amount of tissue and you have to maximize it,"" he said.

The German diagnostics company has three companion diagnostic tests on the U.S. market, including one recently approved for Amgen's colorectal cancer drug Vectibix.

Qiagen has also invested in a new testing platform from PrimeraDx, a privately held Boston-area company. Under an expanded partnership with Eli Lilly and Co, the companies plan to use the new platform to analyze both DNA and RNA biomarkers, targeting multiple molecular pathways active in common cancers.

Roche's Genentech is developing companion tests for about half of the experimental medicines in its pipeline, and is evaluating tests that can look at more than one target at a time, said spokeswoman Holli Dickson.

WASHINGTON Current theory about the shape of the human face just got a big punch in the mouth.

Two University of Utah researchers proposed on Monday that the face of the ancestors of modern humans evolved millions of years ago in a way that would limit injuries from punches during fist fights between males.

Their theory, published in the journal Biological Reviews, is presented as an alternative to a long-standing notion that changes in the shape of the face were driven more by diet - the need for a jaw that could chew hard-to-crush foods such as nuts.

""Studies of injuries resulting from fights show that when modern humans fight, the face is the primary target,"" biologist David Carrier said. ""The bones of the face that suffer the highest rates of fracture from fights are the bones that show the greatest increase in robusticity during the evolution of early bipedal apes, the australopiths.""

These are also the bones that show the greatest difference between women and men in early human ancestors and modern humans, Carrier added.

In both apes and humans, males are much more violent than females, and most male violence is directed at other males, Carrier said. The violence underpinning the need for a more robust facial structure may have involved fist fights over females, resources and other disputes.

Australopithecus was a lineage that preceded our genus, Homo, and it emerged more than 4 million years ago in Africa. Australopithecus was bipedal, smaller than modern people and possessed a combination of ape and human characteristics.

""Comparing great apes such as chimps and gorillas to australopiths, what changed in the face was a reduction in the length of the jaws, a great increase in the robustness and strength of the jaws, molar teeth and jaw muscles, a substantial increase in the size and strength of the cheek bones, and an increase in the part of the face that surrounds the eyes,"" Carrier said.

The proportions of the hand that allowed for the formation of a fist and the great increases in the robustness of the face occurred early in our lineage, 4 million to 5 million years ago, at about the same time as the bipedal posture appeared, Carrier added.

Carrier said anthropologists have thought the new facial traits in the first bipedal apes were the result of a diet that included very hard objects, and the biomechanics of eating such food can explain many of these features. But he said recent analyses of wear patterns in teeth suggest most of these creatures did not eat hard objects.

The study by Carrier and Michael Morgan, a University of Utah physician, builds on their previous research highlighting the role they contend violence played in driving human evolution.

""I think our science is sound and fills some longstanding gaps in the existing theories of why the musculoskeletal structures of our faces developed the way they did,"" Morgan added.

Lewis Hamilton is ready to take an unfamiliar bull by the horns this weekend as Austria's revamped Red Bull Ring returns to the Formula One calendar after an 11-year absence.

The Mercedes driver, a teenager when Austria last hosted a grand prix in 2003, needs to win at Spielberg to rein in championship-leading team mate Nico Rosberg after the blow of retirement in Canada 10 days ago.

""I've never driven the circuit but I've been working on it in the simulator and I'm sure I'll learn it pretty quickly when we get out on track,"" the 2008 world champion said in a team preview.

""It's always exciting to go to a new venue, so it should be an interesting weekend. I'm feeling good in the car right now and I'll be pushing flat out to come away with maximum points this time around.""

With Rosberg finishing first or second in every race so far this season, while Hamilton has retired twice, the German now has a 22-point lead as the championship arrives at Red Bull's home track for the eighth race of 19 this year.

Hamilton may have to win another four races in a row, as he did earlier in the year, just to regain the upper hand if Rosberg stays that consistent.

""There is a long, long way to go. I caught up before and I'll catch up again,"" said the Briton, who started the season with a retirement in Australia that left him 25 points adrift.

""It's going to take another four wins to make the difference so I'm going to do my best to get those results.""

Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff was not discounting that possibility.

""Obviously, Nico now holds an increased gap at the top of the championship but Lewis is a fighter and I have no doubt that he will come back stronger than ever,"" he said.

HOME RACE

Mercedes have been dominant this season but Austrian-owned Red Bull broke their winning streak in Canada when Australian Daniel Ricciardo took his first F1 victory ahead of what amounts to a home race for the team.

The short but scenic track, in the southern Styrian mountains, remains largely the same as the old A1 Ring and is set to be a big celebration of motorsport in Austria with every living Austrian F1 driver taking part in a legends parade.

How much of a celebration it will be for Red Bull remains to be seen.

""We're going to have a lot of home support. There's still a gap to Mercedes, we are working on closing that down,"" team principal Christian Horner said after Montreal.

""To have a race at the Red Bull Ring as Red Bull Racing - with that comes a bit of pressure but it will be fantastic to perform in front of effectively a home crowd.""

Quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel has driven the circuit on a number of occasions but only four current drivers - Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen - have raced there in Formula One.

None have won and only Raikkonen has stood on the podium.

The last winner at the track was Michael Schumacher, the seven times world champion who is now in hospital in Switzerland after recently emerging from a coma following a ski accident at the end of last year.

Schumacher also had one of the most controversial wins of his career at the circuit in 2002 when Brazilian team mate Rubens Barrichello was ordered to let him pass despite dominating the race.

Of the newcomers, McLaren's Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen and Toro Rosso's Russian newcomer Daniil Kvyat are those with the freshest experience having raced there last year in the Renault 3.5 World Series and Formula Three respectively.

Rory McIlroy says he will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, putting an end to speculation that he may have chosen to play for Great Britain instead.

The 25-year-old two-time major winner was born in Northern Ireland and could have represented both Ireland at Britain when golf returns to the Olympic stage for the first time since 1904.

""I see this as a continuation of what I have always done,"" he was reported as saying on Wednesday ahead of the Irish Open at the Fota Golf Club in Cork.

""I have been thinking about it a lot. I don't know if it is because the World Cup is in Brazil and I was thinking a couple of years down the line.

""I was thinking about all the times I have played for Ireland as a boy and everything. For me it is the right decision to play for Ireland.""

McIlroy, who recently split from his fiancee, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, had earlier said ""he would probably play for Great Britain"", and in 2013 suggested he may miss the tournament altogether to avoid controversy over any decision.

""I was always very proud to put on the Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very proud to do it again,"" he added.

""Just because now that I'm playing golf for money and I'm a professional, I'm supposed to have this choice or this decision to make, where if you look at the rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players, they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf.

""I don't think there's any point to change that or go against that just because it's a different event or it's the Olympics.

""I've had a lot of time on my own the last few weeks and just been thinking about it a lot. It's something that's been quite important to me and something that I needed to make some sort of decision or some sort of stand on it.

""Just weighing up everything, and thinking back about the times that I played for Ireland and won the European Team championship with Ireland, won a lot of great amateur titles representing Ireland, I just thought why change that?""

BRASILIA Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa produced a heroic performance in a 0-0 draw with Brazil and his Russian counterpart Igor Akinfeev was the villain in a 1-1 draw with South Korea as the World Cup produced more drama on Tuesday.

While Ochoa kept Brazil at bay, the hapless Akinfeev was left to bury his head in his hands after he allowed Lee Keun-ho's straightforward shot from 25 meters to slip through his grasp.

Algeria ended their 28-year wait for a World Cup goal when they took a shock lead against Belgium although it was not enough as the highly-rated Europeans hit back to win 2-1 in the day's other match.

Ochoa produced four world class saves to deny Paulinho, Neymar (twice) and Thiago Silva when they seemed certain to score in an intense, end-to-end match in tropical Fortaleza which left both teams with four points from two games in Group A.

Silva thought he had won the game in the closing minutes with a powerful header only to see his effort parried at point blank range by the Mexican keeper.

Despite the scoreline, the match was anything but dull and the Mexicans enjoyed long periods of possession, bravely taking the game to the hosts in the second half.

""I believe this was the best match of my life because this was a World Cup game and this is very important,"" said Ochoa.

""I don't know whether I can think of another goalkeeper in memory...someone who has done what Memo (Ochoa) did today,"" Mexico coach Miguel Herrera told a news conference.

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari also praised Ochoa, describing his performance as spectacular, and could not resist pointing out that this time, unlike the controversial 3-1 win over Croatia, his side had a late penalty appeal turned down.

""There was no penalty in favor of Brazil,"" said 'Big Phil', shrugging his shoulders.

Cameroon and Croatia, the other teams in the group, who are yet to get off the mark, meet in Manuals on Wednesday.

In the Group H clash in Cuiaba, Akinfeev's blushes on 68 minutes were spared when veteran Alexander Kerzhakov pounced to equalize for Russia after more scrappy goalkeeping by Jung Sung-ryong six minutes later.

Much-fancied Belgium were made to work hard for a 2-1 win over Algeria in Belo Horizonte after the North Africans took a shock lead with a Sofiane Feghouli penalty in the 25th minute.

It was Algeria’s first goal at the tournament since Djamel Zidane scored against Northern Ireland in a 1-1 draw in 1986.

Algeria played two more games at that tournament and three at the 2010 World Cup without scoring.

The Desert Foxes kept the lead until the last 20 minutes when goals from substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens turned the game around, much to the anger of Algeria coach Vahid Halilhodzic.

""It's a major disappointment,"" he said. ""I have a number of players that are rather limited, they're young, they're not that experienced, they can't play 90 minutes.

""Each Algerian player needs to improve his physical condition by 30 to 50 percent. The Belgian players are in much better shape.""

Portugal's troubles continued after their 4-0 thrashing by Germany on Monday when left back Fabio Coentrao was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a thigh muscle injury.

“It’s a very sad moment for me, and one that I want to forget as quickly as possible,” he told the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) website.

Defending champions Spain, who made an even worse start than Portugal when they were thrashed 5-1 by Netherlands in their opening match, face Chile in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.

Netherlands face Australia in Porto Alegre. ""There was no euphoria in the team. We have played Total Football. Nothing has changed in that respect. We are applying the Dutch principles,"" said flamboyant coach Louis van Gaal.

BRASILIA U.S. Vice President Joe Biden might not have resolved a diplomatic spat with Brazil over American espionage, but he got a kick out of seeing the United States soccer team win their first World Cup game.

""Watching the United States win last night was a great thrill for us,"" Biden told reporters on Tuesday hours after seeing the Americans defeat Ghana 2-1.

Biden brought his soccer-playing granddaughter and a nephew with him to Monday's game. ""I'm the favorite grandfather in the family right now,"" he joked.

Biden met with Brazil President Dilma Rousseff to try to reboot U.S.-Brazilian relations that have been on hold since documents leaked last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that Washington had spied on Rousseff and other world leaders.

Host Brazil has taken a lot of heat for the late delivery of unfinished stadiums for the World Cup, but Biden praised the Dunes arena in the north-eastern city of Natal.

""The stadium is absolutely beautiful and it met every expectation,"" he said.

Biden visited the locker-room after the game and congratulated the U.S. team, praising goalkeeper Tim Howard in particular.

""He played an incredible game last night,"" he said.

Biden knows Howard from the last World Cup in South Africa and they agreed to meet again in 2018 in Russia.

""He will probably have the same job,"" Biden said. ""I'm not sure I will have the same one.""

Ireland's first Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley returns to action on home soil this week fired up by German Martin Kaymer's emphatic US Open triumph last Sunday.

A satisfied observer of Kaymer's eight-shot win at Pinehurst, North Carolina, McGinley was 'buzzing' on Tuesday ahead of playing in the Irish Open at Fota Island Resort, where he won the first of his four Irish PGA Championships in 1997.

""On the back of Martin's win, it creates a buzz for everybody at this tournament, everybody in the European Tour in the background and obviously me (as) Ryder Cup captain,"" said McGinley.

""It is exciting. There are a lot of exciting players in the field. Obviously Rory McIlroy is going to get a lot of attention and Graeme McDowell, too. It's all good and there is a good buzz around the place.""

With all four Major champions from both sides of the Irish border in the field - Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington, McDowell and McIlroy - McGinley is looking forward to big home crowds at the event, which has returned to Cork for the first time in 12 years.

""I think some venues are blessed with good weather and Fota Island seems to be blessed,"" added McGinley, who will lead the European team against the United States at Gleneagles in Scotland in September.

""The last time we were here the weather was sensational, as well, and looks like we are going to have a tremendous week too, the way the forecast is.""

Ryder Cup stalwart Harrington, who finished tied second and tied sixth when the Irish Open was last played at Fota Island, in 2001 and 2002, was equally happy at the prospect of a return.

""It's obviously been a happy hunting ground for me over the years. I do like the venue. I like the atmosphere the venue gives off,"" said the three-time major champion.

He will play alongside McIlroy and Scotland's Stephen Gallacher for the opening two rounds, while McDowell and fellow Irishman Shane Lowry will be joined by defending champion Paul Casey.

707,"""At the beginning, life and death is every week, and then you have longer cycles,"" says Riccardo Zacconi, chief executive of Britain's most valuable games company, the $5bn (£2.9bn) King Digital Entertainment. He is talking about the rollercoaster that has been King's decade-long ride to the top.

Zacconi, 47, sports the tech entrepreneur's regulation casualwear, with a dash of Italian style. He is dressed top to toe in navy blue, with matching polo shirt, jeans and trainers. The office around him vibrates with the explosion-in-a-paint factory colours of King's hit smartphone game, Candy Crush.

At the end of an orange-and-white striped corridor is a staff cafeteria with panoramic views of London's West End, where the Nespresso machine hums next to an ostentatious array of coffee capsules, and a beautician applies the finishing touches to an employee's Friday night makeup.

More people play King games each month than live in the US, and the company is currently in expansion mode. In a few weeks, it will open a second London studio, taking over Facebook's recently vacated British headquarters in Covent Garden.

But the free caffeine and makeovers are a far cry from the company's early days. Back in 2003, a year after launch, the money had run out. Zacconi had been living rent-free in a friend's spare room, working without a salary. It was just before Christmas, and he was flying home to Italy later that day. He and his co-founder Toby Rowland, son of the late mining tycoon and Observer newspaper proprietor Tiny Rowland, were staring at the fax machine, willing it to come to life.

""We had a promise from one of our angels [early backers] to invest in the company, but the piece of paper was not signed,"" recalls Zacconi. ""We wanted to make sure we could pay all our creditors, and to do that we would have had to shut down the company that day.""

At the last minute the fax arrived, only for the machine to break down mid-transmission. But King lived to fight another day.

The angel investor was King's chairman, a low-profile, Derby-based businessman called Mel Morris, who at the age of 58 has little in common with the hipsters in silicon roundabout, but just happens to be one of Britain's most successful technology entrepreneurs. Morris built uDate, where Zacconi briefly worked, into the world's second largest online matchmaker before selling it in 2002. He is now King's biggest private investor, holding shares worth $580m.

""Riccardo understands people,"" says Morris. ""His charisma, integrity, sense of fair play and abundant humility allow him to gently lead from the front. Many entrepreneurs fail because they are so single-minded they struggle to scale their business beyond their own limitations. Riccardo succeeds because he allows his management to share the challenges and rewards.""

The hardest moment for King came in 2009. Rowland, who was co-chief executive, had left to work on other ventures and Zacconi was in sole charge. King.com was profitable, with revenues of $60m a year from desktop games. But its business was built on attracting traffic from the big internet portals such as Yahoo, and their days were numbered.

""The hardest moment was when Facebook was the place to be and we were not there,"" says Zacconi. ""The only way to manage a period of transition like that is to be 100% open and transparent with your employees.""

So he gathered the staff and showed them an illustration by the cartoonist Mordillo. A holidaying couple are relaxing on a beach under a parasol. But the beach is in an hourglass and the sand is rapidly draining from beneath them.

There followed a tense 18 months, when the company raced to develop a game that would appeal to Facebook users before its portal traffic dried up. Morris advised halting development for Yahoo, and splitting the spare staff into teams of three, each testing different formats.

In September 2011 Bubble Witch Saga, where players line up three or more spheres of the same colour to pop them, launched on Facebook. By the end of that year, revenues from mobile and social games had outstripped those from older desktop formats. The transition to mobile was easier, with the Bubble Witch Saga app published in July 2012. But the big break came in November 2012, when Candy Crush, another match three game, made its appearance on mobile. By the end of that year, King was pulling in $160m annually. By 2013, revenues were $1.9bn, with small payments for extra lives or sweetie-shaped ammunition on Candy Crush accounting for the vast majority of that income.

Christian Hernandez Gallardo, who helped build Facebook in Europe and now invests in startups through White Star Capital, has described Zacconi as one of the ""good guys"" of the technology business, saying: ""This is not an overnight success, or an 18 month exit. It is over a decade of building and rebuilding a business, of adapting to trends and technologies, of being humble but hungry.""

Now King is having another Mordillo moment. The markets have given the company a rough ride since its March initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, discounting the valuation by $2bn. Despite a slight rise in the most recent quarter, revenues are down from their peak last Autumn. The concern is that King cannot repeat its success with Candy Crush, which is beginning to slip down the download charts.

""Our strategy is not based on building another hit game like Candy Crush,"" says Zacconi. ""It was a mega hit. Our strategy is to build a portfolio of games."" He wants players looking for games in enduring genres, like trivia, hidden object, or word puzzles, to pick King's version because they trust the quality.

Wall Street is hammering other digital stocks – Facebook has dipped, and Twitter has lost half its value this year. Are we witnessing another technology bubble bursting?

""I don't think it's a bubble, there are real fundamentals behind these companies: revenues, profits and reach,"" says Zacconi. ""The companies now are very different to 1999.""

As his business vocabulary suggests, Zacconi trained as a management consultant with the blue chip firm Boston Consulting. He went on to learn the lessons of the dotcom crash the hard way, building up a European internet portal called Spray. The float planned for 2000 was abandoned, and the company sold up to another portal, Lycos Europe.

But the purchase was made entirely in Lycos shares, with no cash element. By 2001, those shares were almost worthless, and Lycos was laying off hundreds of people.

""We took care of every employee,"" says Zacconi. ""We made sure everyone had a job somewhere. That was good because when I started this company what we did was to call up all our former employees, and they were very friendly.""

Zacconi reunited his best people, including chief creative officer Sebastian Knutsson, who now runs the firm's Stockholm studios, the crucible from which King's most successful games have emerged.

Zacconi applauds the government's decision this year to grant tax breaks to games produced in the UK, an extension of the film credits that have attracted dozens of Hollywood productions to Britain. ""This new incentive for the games industry is great,"" he says, ""because I believe from the UK you can conquer the world.""

711,"Asos, Zoopla and Spotify among most valuable startups, with the UK particularly successful in creating technology millionaires

Europe has produced 30 technology companies worth more than $1bn (£590m) since the millennium, according to research that explodes the myth that the region's internet entrepreneurs lack vision and sell up too early.

Clothing retailer Asos, games studio King Digital, property portal Zoopla and music service Spotify are among the select group of Europe's most valuable technology companies, most of which remain independent.

The research, conducted by boutique investment bank GP Bullhound, shows Europe compares well to the US, which produced 39 billion-dollar companies between 2003 and 2013.

These valuable startups, which the researchers refer to as ""unicorns"", are few and far between. Statistically, it is very hard to find one, and the 30 produced in Europe account for just 0.27% of comparable tech firms founded in the last 14 years. (Israel is included in the numbers, due to its strength in tech and proximity to Europe.)

America's hit rate appears lower. A comparable study by startup fund Cowboy Ventures found just 0.07% of venture backed groups started since 2003 had reached billion-dollar valuations.

The UK, with its big domestic market, love of online shopping and high level of internet and smartphone adoption, has been most successful in creating technology millionaires – since January 2000, the country has produced 11 unicorns. Among these are recently listed appliances retailer AO World and takeaway service Just Eat.

Russia is in second place with five unicorns, including Yandex, a highly successful search engine with a larger share of the market than Google. Its equivalent to Amazon, a company founded in 2008 called Ulmart, is said to be considering a London stock market listing next year.

Sweden is in third place with four unicorns, including Spotify, games company Mojang – which makes Minecraft – and the Anglo-Swedish group King, creator of smartphone game Candy Crush. Finland and France have produced two, and Germany, Spain, Ireland, Israel, Italy and Luxembourg one each.

""Europe is much more adept at creating billion-dollar tech companies than most experts expected. The fact that it is in touching distance of the US demonstrates how both the ambition levels and ecosystem have progressed to allow entrepreneurs to scale global businesses,"" said GP Bullhound co-founder Manish Madhvani.

""The much-voiced criticism of UK tech has been that owners tend to sell out too early to US tech giants. However, this is clearly changing with many companies such as Spotify, Just Eat, Criteo and Zoopla turning down multiple approaches to create true global leaders.""

Despite the recent spate of initial public offerings in London, two of the biggest European unicorns have recently turned to Nasdaq and the New York stock exchange for their debut on the public markets. King chose America for its $7bn IPO earlier this year, while online financial information group Markit has picked Nasdaq for its estimated $4.5bn listing.

Chipmaker ARM, worth nearly £13bn, and accounting software group Sage, valued at £4.5bn, are the only computer technology businesses among the FTSE 100 largest companies listed in London. British technology companies have long complained that London lacks analysts and investors with expertise in online and computing.

Only half of European unicorns have reached a sale or an IPO, compared with two-thirds in America, which the researchers say points to a more challenging environment for technology investment.

Building a billion-dollar company appears to be a team effort, with most entrepreneurs working in pairs or teams of three. Many founders start their hit companies in their 30s, with 33 being the average age.

The two European unicorns to have found buyers are Skype, which was acquired by Microsoft for $8.5bn, and Finland's Supercell, which makes mobile game Clash of Clans and was recently bought by Japanese telecoms and internet group Softbank.

713,"Budget carrier Wizz Air has scrapped plans for a £200m flotation on the London stock exchange, blaming turbulence in the aviation market.

The Hungarian airline, which is the largest low-cost carrier in central and eastern Europe, announced plans to raise £200m on the London markets less than four weeks ago. But on Monday it said it had decided ""not to proceed with an IPO at this stage, due to the current market volatility in the airline sector"".

The company said: ""The outlook for Wizz Air's business remains extremely positive and unaffected by the decision not to proceed with an IPO.""

Since the company's decision to seek a prestigious London listing, European airline stocks have been hammered amid growing concerns about overcapacity in the sector, despite an improving economy. A recent profit warning from Lufthansa, which wiped 11% off its share price, rocked the industry, further dragging down share prices of aviation and travel firms across European bourses.

Since its first flight in 2004, Wizz Air has become one of Europe's largest no-frills airlines, carrying almost 14 million passengers a year, although it has also gained a reputation for tardiness, being accused of operating the UK's least punctual service.

Despite Wizz Air's decision to ground its current IPO plans, the London stock market is still facing a record year for initial public offerings. A total of 40 companies have raised £5.7bn from the start of the year until early June, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The money raised in 2014 easily outstrips the previous £4.9bn record for the same period, in 2007, and the £2.9bn equivalent in 2006, which went on to be the all-time biggest year for flotations. TSB bank, property website Zoopla and the budget hotel chain easyHotel are all set to join the market in the coming weeks, despite waning appetite from investors bombarded by new offers.

715,"China will deepen its investment in the UK, with around £18bn of deals expected to be signed during a three-day visit by the premier, Li Keqiang, starting on Monday.

The visit, involving 200 Chinese business leaders, is also expected to shed more light on its involvement in the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation, at Hinkley Point in Somerset. China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) have already agreed in principle to be minority shareholders in the £16bn project.

With deals expected to focus on energy and nuclear power, Li's visit underscores how the nature of Chinese infrastructure investment has changed. Early Chinese infrastructure investors focused on utilities, such as water companies and airports, companies with predictable revenue streams and reliable returns.

Graham Matthews, a partner in Deloitte's China services group, said the nation was moving beyond ""pure financial play"", into new-build investments, where its ""world-leading expertise"" in areas such as high-speed rail made it an attractive partner for the UK.

""The financial investments will continue, but China has knowledge that is very relevant to the UK, which would make strategic investments more relevant."" If it is purely financial there is a lot of competition for those deals, but for strategic investment, China brings other things … that makes them a compelling partner.""

He cited examples, such as China's prowess with railways and pledges to encourage Asian companies to set-up their European headquarters at a business park, being constructed on derelict land in east London.

China's sovereign wealth fund owns 9% of the UK's largest water company,Thames Water, while a Hong Kong-based investment consortium controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing owns more than a quarter of Northumbrian Water.

Canary Wharf

China was one of several investors, including Qatar and investment banks, that rescued the property company that owns Canary Wharf. The property company, Songbird Estates, had been struggling with its debts before an international consortium of investors bought it out in 2009.

Royal Albert Dock

A Chinese developer signed a £1bn deal with London's mayor, Boris Johnson, to build a business park on the site of the derelict Royal Albert Docks in east London. Advanced Business Park – the developer– has promised to build ""a city within a city"" by 2017, where Asian companies will site their European headquarters.

Weetabix

The nation's favourite breakfast cereal was snapped up by Chinese government-owned Bright foods in 2012. The company bought a 60% stake in the 80-year old cereal, with the aim of expanding the brand abroad, especially in Asia.

Heathrow airport

China Investment Corporation added Heathrow to its list of assets in 2012 when it bought a 10% stake in the UK's largest airport. Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, remains the biggest shareholder with a 25% stake.

London's black cabs

A private Chinese carmaker, Geely, rode to the rescue of the maker of London's black cabs Manganese Bronze, paying £11m to buy the troubled firm after it fell into administration. Geely also owns Volvo, but analysts questioned its decision to buy a carmaker with potentially limited export potential that had not turned a profit for five years before the rescue.

Sunseeker

The Somerset company that makes luxury yachts sailed by James Bond villains was bought by China's second richest man Wang Jianlin and his Dalian Wanda group in a £300m deal last year. The group is also spending £700 on building a luxury hotel near Vauxhall in London.

Harvey Nichols

The upmarket department store loved by Absolutely Fabulous' fashionistas, has been rejuvenated since it was bought by Hong Kong luxury goods tycoon Dickson Poon in 1991. Since his company took over, the store has expanded beyond its London base into the Midlands and north of Britain.

Superdrug

High-street stalwart Superdrug has been owned by Hong-Kong based AS Watson since 2002, the world's largest health and beauty retailer.

Potential future investments

Nuclear power (Hinkley Point)

Two Chinese companies are potentially taking a 40% stake in Hinkley Point, the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation. The £16bn plant is expected to provide enough energy to power 7% of British homes for 60 years. Hinkley Point is only one of 12 nuclear plants that the government hopes to see built in the coming decades, and China is expected to be involved in several of them.

HS2

China's president Li Keqiang told David Cameron last year that the country would like to be involved in HS2. The China Railway Group has since offered to finance and build links to Birmingham station.

The Thames tunnel

China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, already owns almost a tenth of Thames Water. Now Whitehall officials are said to be courting Chinese investors to invest in the £4.2bn Thames tunnel – the London ""super sewer"" – a controversial project that has not yet had the green light from planners.

A third runway at Heathrow

Chinese grandees have already singled out the failure to build a third runway at Heathrow as one of the UK's problems. If Heathrow's expansion plans go ahead, Chinese investors, who already own 10% of the airport, are expected to be involved in financing and building it.

717,"Survey by Rightmove shows that asking prices in the capital fell by 0.5%, suggesting they may have hit an 'affordability cap'

The debate about house prices is reignited on Mondayamid claims by Britain's biggest property website that prices for homes have come ""off the boil"".

For the first time this year, the asking prices posted on the Rightmove website for homes in London fell by 0.5% in early June, compared with the month before, in part due to a rapid increase in sellers rushing to cash in on rising prices.

In some areas, especially in London, prices may have hit an ""affordability cap"", the website said.

Rightmove added that asking prices have ""come off the boil"" and prices in England and Wales are at a virtual standstill, rising by just 0.1% – or £272 – on the previous month.

On a year-on-year basis, though, prices in London are up 14.5% on a year ago, even after the slide in asking prices put on sale by estate agents compared to the month before.

Even so Rightmove said the findings will come as a relief to the Bank of England ahead of the meeting of its policymaking body, the financial policy committee (FPC) this week.

The rapid rise in house prices has been the subject of much debate, particularly since last week when chancellor George Osborne said he would give the FPC new powers to impose caps on the amounts banks and other lenders hand out for home loans compared with customers' incomes or the value of their property.

While the FPC is not expected to use such powers immediately, the chancellor announced his intention to give the Bank of England additional scope over lending, just as the governor Mark Carney was warning interest rates could begin to rise from their historic low of 0.5% earlier than expected.

Charlie Bean, the retiring deputy governor of the Bank, told the Sunday Times, that the first rate rise in five years would be a ""symbolic step because it will be an indication that we are on the road back to normality"".

He added: ""Frankly, having interest rates at an emergency level for a very long time is not a situation one wants to be in."" According to the Nationwide building society, house prices have reached their pre-crisis peak, with London driving the boom with annual price rises of 18%.

Rightmovemeasures the asking price of houses, while Nationwide bases its findings on mortgages it approves each month.

""The London market powers the rest of the UK but is starting to run out of steam, said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's director and housing market analyst.

""While the legacy of rises in central London continues to ripple out to its better-value commuter belt, fuelling price increases in all southern regions, London itself is now marking time. It's an example to the rest of the country of what happens when affordability and common sense get stretched too far,"" he said.

The housing market usually dips in June and the summer months but Rightmove said this month's slide was below the 0.6% average over the past 10 years.

""Some sellers will be looking to cash in and possibly get a lot more house for their money further out, but they may have missed the peak in the rush to realise their gains as parts of London appear to have hit the upper limit price buffer.

""This rise in the number of sellers has also been seen in the north and, when combined with this month's price falls in five out of six northern regions, should put paid to some of the ill-informed national bubble talk,"" said Shipside.

He pointed to the introduction of the mortgage market review, which forces lenders to scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings and check they can still afford repayments if interest rates started to rise.

""It is certainly causing a major headache for some estate agents with U-turns by lenders meaning sales falling through and heartache for buyers and sellers who thought they had a deal agreed,"" Shipside said.","London house prices have come off the boil, say analysts",http://www.theguardian.com,[Jill Treanor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/10/1281461564940/A-For-Sale-sign-007.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=60bde6ffb0650cd50d75d3cfc7a2c7f9,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/london-house-prices-off-boil-analysts
719,"Wine retailer reported a 0.1% fall in like-for-like sales for the year to the end of March, but sales of bottles over £20 rose by nearly a fifth

Majestic Wine has reported a dip in sales from its high-street stores, although consumers' taste for more expensive fine wines helped keep some sparkle in its profits.

The specialist wine retailer with 206 stores announced on Monday annual pre-tax profits of £23.8m on sales of £278.2m – up from £23.7m in 2013 – in line with expectations following a shock profits warning in March.

The retailer was caught out by a slowdown in sales after Christmas, as consumers cut back spending on wine to drink at home. Majestic reported a 0.1% fall in like-for-like sales for the year to the end of March, although the average spend per bottle rose to £7.94 from £7.56 last year, with the average spend per transaction up by one pound to £129.

Sales of ""fine wine"", bottles priced at £20 and above, increased by almost a fifth to £18.7m.

Rosé wine from Provence also proved appetising for Majestic's customers, with sales up 84% over the year. Sales of Malbec from Argentina, France and Chile rose 50%.

Although the wine retailer expects sales to remain subdued well into 2015, it continues to open new stores, and sees potential for up to 330 outlets in the UK. Majestic sells 4.1% of wine in the UK and data from independent market analyst Nielsen showed it pushed up its market share by 0.1% in the face of fierce competition from supermarkets.

The company's focus on bricks and mortar comes alongside an expanding online presence: online sales were up 5.8% last year, and now represent 11.4% all sales.

Chief executive Steve Lewis said: ""Majestic made good operational progress in the last year and despite the difficult trading environment delivered a solid performance. 2015 will be a year of increased investment for Majestic to ensure that we have the right infrastructure to maximise on our long-term opportunities for future growth.""",Majestic Wine sales dip but fine wines now in favour,http://www.theguardian.com,[Jennifer Rankin],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402904313829/Fine-wines-at-Majestic.-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=14198c586cbedc09dd1b4500d34e0fe1,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/majestic-fine-wines-sales-dip

A quick recap:

Argentina has lost its appeal against paying $1.3bn bonds to a group of hedge funds, following its 2001 default.

The US Supreme Court threw out Argentina's case, forcing it to meet payments to them and also service other bonds which have been restructured.

The ruling fuels fears that Argentina could suffer a new technical default, with a bond payment due at the end of June.

Bond prices tumbled, as did shares in Buenos Aires, while the cost of insuring Argentinian bonds soared to new highs.

723,"The Savina Caylyn oil tanker was near the Yemeni island of Socotra when five pirates boarded and turned off its tracking systems, disabling surveillance of the 105,000-ton vessel by its insurance company.

Investigators commissioned the Cosmo-Skymed satellite to fly across the seas close to the coast of Somalia to see if there were any clues to what had happened.

Shortly after, a murky photograph of a light revealed, upon close examination, the Savina Caylyn en route to what would turn out to be a mooring area for tankers captured by pirates.

That was in February 2011 and, while piracy in the Indian Ocean was nothing new, that satellite technology should be used in such a way by a commercial company to find a missing ship was a relatively fresh development. The success of the operation is used by a British body which promotes the use of emerging technologies to illustrate the possibilities for UK companies of using big data from space.

In the Oxfordshire offices of the Satellite Applications Catapult, one of a network of technology and innovation centres established by the Technology Strategy Board to generate growth, a screen displays another maritime project – this time created with an environmental charity – that investigates vessels that switch off their Automatic Identification System (AIS)before fishing illegally, thinking they cannot be traced. Satellite imagery can monitor the paths of fishing vessels and there are plans for data to be relayed to the authorities if illegal activity is suspected.

The Satellite Applications Catapult is working to make businesses aware of the variety of data that is available and to help companies to benefit from it in an attempt to make Britain an international player in the use of satellite applications, according to Alan Cox, the director of the body's trading arm.

Milton Keynes council plans to start using satellite information in September to track planning violations. Using photographs of the town taken quarterly, software will pinpoint changes in buildings. Agreed planning permissions will show up in blue and developments in orange. Where the two do not agree, the council will investigate. Previously, a five-person team covering 340 sq km of land had to rely on methods such as tips from locals to find violations.

""One of the reasons the catapults have been set up is this criticism of the UK by the UK that we are brilliant at innovation but terrible at commercialising it – we lose the idea or give the idea away. So part of this is taking existing technology, existing capability, and talking to customers with real-world problems,"" said Cox.

""The issue is that, if we do nothing, then we will be buying Chinese [and] Indian applications rather than at least having a share of the market.""

The available satellite data with the highest detail has a magnification of 50cm to a pixel, so cars and houses are easily identifiable. Geospatial Insight uses satellite data to estimate the limits of flood damage for insurance companies so they can assess their exposure and is also developing methods to advise financial companies on the likely seasonal yields of commodities such as palm oil.

Dave Fox, the managing director, said developments in technology meant ideas that would not have been possible to realise only a few years ago had become viable propositions.

""Five years ago, there were probably 10 to 15 useful satellites that you could apply into this type of market,"" he said. ""The problem was that a satellite might only come over a particular spot every 26 days or every 30 days. It was very hard to get the [repetition] to deliver a reliable service.

""There are probably now 120 useful satellites as of today and this year it is probably going to be nearer 200.""

AgSpace, a Swindon-based company of 20 people, started using satellite imagery so that the quality of crops could be identified by farmers. Photographs of large swaths of land are processed for farms ranging from 200 to 10,000 acres. Analysis reveals soil types and the quality of crop yields, among other information, so that farmers can plan how best to use their land. ""What used to take two, three, four years in trials with academics, we can now look at the data and do in hours,"" director Vincent Gillingham said.

WeatherSafe in Oxfordshire aims to use data to advise coffee farmers about the best way to manage their land by collating and interpreting data on soil absorption, plant health and other factors to determine how to work fields.

Director Francesco Liucci said the model could be adapted to any sort of agricultural production.

With the possibility of much smaller satellites soon being launched in greater numbers, it is expected that the price of data that can be provided from space will come down as economies of scale and greater competition come into play.

A farmer using the AgSpace service can expect to pay between £5 and £10 a year per hectare, depending on the level of service. Milton Keynes council would pay about £100,000 a year for satellite images and interpretation, said Cox.

Disaster response is another area that can utilise photographs from space. Sentinel-1A, the first in a fleet of satellites for the European Space Agency's Copernicus Earth observation project, which was previously known as Global Monitoring for Environment and Security, launched on 3 April. It will offer images in the event of a natural disaster such as an oil spill. It has already fed back data mapping the floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

725,"Starbucks is rolling out a programme that would allow its workers to earn an online college degree at Arizona State University at a discounted rate.

The coffee chain is partnering with the university to offer the option to 135,000 employees in the US who work at least 20 hours a week. Starbucks, based in Seattle, says it will phase out its existing tuition reimbursement programme, which gave workers up to $1,000 (£590) a year for education at certain schools.

The company says the programme does not require workers to stay at Starbucks after they earn their degrees. They can choose from a wide range of educational programmes that are not related to their Starbucks work.

Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, is scheduled to announce the programme on Monday in New York City, with US education secretary Arne Duncan and about 340 workers and their family members in attendance.

It is unclear how many workers will choose to take part in the new programme or how much it will cost Starbucks. The company is not disclosing the financial terms of its agreement with Arizona State University. But the programme could boost the enrolment for Arizona State's online programme, which charges tuition of about $10,000 a year, which is about the same as the school's traditional degree programme.

Tuition reimbursement is a rare benefit for low-wage workers in the retail industry, but Starbucks is not the first to offer it. In 2010, Wal-Mart launched a partnership with American Public University, a for-profit, online establishment, to give workers and family members partial tuition grants. The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, says more than 400 of its workers have since completed degrees through the programme. Wal-Mart's programme also does not require workers to stay and allows them to pursue a variety of degrees.

Starbucks' existing tuition reimbursement programme, set up in 2011, gives workers up to $1,000 a year for courses at City University of Seattle or Strayer University. Starbucks has paid out $6.5m under that programme to date, the company said.",Starbucks offers to part-fund online degree course for US employees,http://www.theguardian.com,[The Associated Press],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402908016284/Customers-visit-a-Starbuc-007.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=0947b07b86d07fe9bfc763103a6ce803,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/starbucks-online-degree-us-employees-arizona
727,"Britons seem reluctant to embrace the likes of Uber, Airbnb and Zipcar, but mobile technology is sure to revolutionise business

There is something predictable about the reaction of most British people to joining the sharing economy. They're not interested.

Asked if they would rent out a room in their house, see their car disappear for a daily return of £30 or lend someone their best suit or dress for cash, 63% told pollsters ""no thanks"". The survey found women in the UK were even more reluctant than men.

Across southern Europe, a sense of desperation has turned millions of people to sharing, in a reversal of the proportion who say yes in the UK.

Nielsen, which carried out an online global survey of 30,000 people, mused that British reserve may be at the root, combined with a relative wealth that makes sharing unnecessary.

Yet the tide is turning, especially among young Britons, who the survey found were much more likely to embrace the idea.

And why would they not be in favour of sharing when low and stagnant wages combined with a rising cost of living and weekly advances in mobile technology make it easier and potentially more profitable.

The technology is already uprooting whole industries, such is its power. The strike last week by London black-cab drivers is likely to be the first of many protests by groups of workers fearful of being made redundant by sharing software. And is indicative of the pressure governments are under to rewrite rules made for the old economy.

Uber is a mobile application that links self-employed drivers to customers without the need to hail a cab or phone a minicab. Its claim that it isn't a taxi firm, but a ""ride sharing"" company, doing little more than connecting drivers with passengers, appears to be in breach of London's rules protecting the metered black cab. A court ruling is pending.

San Francisco-based Airbnb has fallen foul of tough laws in London that require landlords to apply for planning permission from the council to rent out their homes for less than three months. In response ministers have promised to sweep away the rule and allow homeowners a more flexible route to renting a room or the whole place as and when they don't need it for themselves.

Zipcar, the car-club operator, is putting pressure on No 10 to classify its business as a form of public transport to exempt its charges from VAT. In a similar vein, a group of startup property consultants wants the government to change the way business rates are calculated to accommodate pop-up shops. At the moment a lease can be as long or short as a landlord likes, but a property must be unused for at least three months before it is exempt from business rates. Why not a weekly calculation for business rates relief, they ask.

Other starlets on the widening stage of ""peer-to-peer"" websites include Zopa, which lends money directly to borrowers; EasyCar Club, which allows car owners to hire out their vehicle to a stranger; and sites such as Girl Meets Dress that allow customers to hire rather than buy a party dress. And for every entrepreneur who is looking to get rich quick, there is another, usually wealthy in their own right, giving away their software in the name of community or localism.

In January, Lord Young welcomed many of these businesses to No 10 and praised them for bravely confronting outmoded means of production. He ditched the friendlier phrase ""creative disruption"" adopted by many sharing firms in favour of ""creative destruction"". Young, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, is the kind of free marketer who knows that big business can ossify an economy. Among 18th-century lords of the manor, he would have been the first to buy a threshing machine.

Job destruction obviously displaces labour, but the sharing economy is absorbing some of them. Manpower, the recruitment agency, said last week that the rise of internet shopping and sharing via apps on mobile phones is triggering a shift in the transport industry. No longer are clothes and books making their way from large distribution centres to individual homes.

Increasingly they are arriving at a local delivery hub to be taken to their destination by a self-employed driver who uses an app to log in and out of work.

This rising tide of self-employment accounts for two out of five jobs created in the past year, pushing the number of people who work for themselves to one in seven of the workforce. While many will be self-employed out of necessity and earning, on average, about 40% less than their employed counterparts, a sizeable proportion consider themselves entrepreneurs and are excited about being their own boss.

Analysis by the Royal Society of Arts shows that for every worker who loses out there are three who say they benefit. It is an entrepreneurialism that the RSA argued is indicative of an unstoppable shift .

Respondents cited factors such as being able to live where they want and work around caring for older relatives or children. The rising cost of childcare was a key consideration, as was the escalating cost of commuting.

Largely unspoken was the lack of pay, wage rises and decent pensions on offer in mainstream jobs culture.

The tax system also encourages workers to look beyond the workplace for extra income. A combination of income tax and national insurance places a 32% marginal tax rate on standard rate taxpayers. Capital gains tax by contrast charges the basic rate taxpayer a rate of 18%, and a higher-rate taxpayer 28%. As such, gains on wealth are more lightly taxed than earned income.

So there are signs that younger home buyers are calculating the gains from renting out a room when they calculate the affordability of a flat that might at first seem out of reach. What if, they ask themselves, they target areas near good transport, a tourist destination or amenities with a view to capitalising on the location by renting some or all of it out, at least for some of the year?

There is some way to go, but this changing way of doing business is surely coming. British reluctance to share is certainly not matched unwillingness to trade stuff online. We are among the biggest eBay-ers in the world and Alibaba.com, the Chinese version of eBay for the business community, reports that UK members are among the biggest sellers on its site (most firms across Europe just seek to buy cheap Asian goods).

743,"When it comes to the statistics on inequality and welfare dependence, it all depends on how you look at it

It’s abundantly clear that the criticism of the budget as being unfair and fostering inequality has hit a nerve. Last week the treasurer, Joe Hockey, attempted to sell his budget as fair in a speech he gave to the Sydney Institute, entitled A Budget for Opportunity. Unfortunately, the evidence Hockey used to make his case showed that his budget fails to meet his own objectives.

After firstly suggesting his critics were indulging in “1970s class warfare”, he attempted to argue that his budget was all about equality. But whereas he accused his critics of being concerned about equality of outcomes, he was focused on equality of opportunity.

Apparently this is a superior form of equality. And it appears he views the main impediment to such equality is welfare.



He noted, with strange amazement, that the amount spent on welfare amounted to “35% of the federal budget”, and that more is spent on welfare than “on any other single policy area including health, education or defence”.

We can only hope Hockey did not think this unusual, because we have always spent more on welfare than on health, education or defence. Even the US, with its huge defence budget, spends more of its federal budget on welfare than defence.

And actually, our spending on welfare has declined over the past decade as a percentage of both the budget outlays and GDP:





Spending on both health and education have outpaced social security spending this century. But social security was Hockey’s main target, and he argued that “payments are too broadly available to too many people. As a result, less is available for those most in need.”



To support this assertion he noted that the OECD had recently found that “Australians in the lowest 20% of income had the highest reliance on government for income of any country in the world.” This is not quite true – we have the fourth highest reliance.



He also asserted that our lowest 20% “have less private income and more government income than Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway or many other countries where government is much larger and the private sector smaller as a percentage of the economy”.



This is true, and I guess he thought it a winning point. Hilariously, however, the very OECD report that he cited shows that our welfare system is actually not too broad, but highly targeted. Indeed, his own statement gave it away. If our government is a much smaller part of the economy, and we spend less than other nations overall on welfare, but our lowest 20% get more welfare than others, then clearly our welfare system is much better targeted.

The OECD’s report, Economic Growth from the Household Perspective, which Hockey cited, did indeed show that our lowest 20% are more dependent on welfare than most other nations, but it also showed our top 20% were the least dependent on welfare.

Even more damning to Hockey’s argument, Australians on both median and average incomes are less dependent on welfare than all other OECD nations except Mexico and Korea:





If Joe Hockey wants to suggest our welfare system is too broad he is best not to compare us with Germany, France or the Netherlands. And perhaps in future he should also not cite a report that actually contradicts his argument.



The OECD in the past has, like Hockey, talked about equality of opportunity. But for equality of opportunity to mean anything it needs to be about more than just as Hockey would suggest, about getting people to the starting line. How you do after the race starts has a lot to do with luck and individual ability, but also the situation of life into which you were born.



In 2007, the OECD noted that equality of opportunity is highly linked to social mobility – i.e. the level with which your parents determine your income. It noted that a driver of increasing equality of opportunity was to reduce income equality. It also noted that a key role in improving equality of opportunity is “early childhood education, care and health”.

These “in-kind payments” – such as education and health care – are crucial for reducing inequality. As I noted in May, while such benefits go to all, they greatly reduce inequality.

Hockey, however, seemed to suggest our current tax system could be considered unfair. He noted that “just 10% of the population pays nearly two thirds of all income tax. In fact, just 2% of taxpayers pay more than a quarter of all income tax.

Maybe these taxpayers would argue that the tax system is already unfair.”



And he is right, the richest do pay a lot of our income tax:





But as I noted last month, such people are dentists, doctors and lawyers. They have achieved such an income in part because they were able to attend subsidised education at a university. In effect, the public subsidised them then so that when they earn more later, they are expected to take on a greater share of the tax burden. And that tax burden allows the government to help lower income people get good health care and education so they might be able to go to university, get subsidised education and become one of the higher tax payers.



It’s a social contract, and it works well. Australia’s social mobility is quite good – not as good as in Scandinavian countries, but not as bad as in the US.

But when Joe Hockey turned to talk of higher education he noted that the government’s policies mean that “no longer will the brickie, the painter, and the chef be subsidising the degrees of the dentist, the doctor or the lawyer to the extent that they currently are.”

And this causes a fatal rift to the social contract.



If the subsidy to those studying to become doctors, dentists and lawyers is reduced then so too is their obligation to pay the tax burden that they do. This budget inevitably creates a drive for lower taxes for the richest.

And with lower taxes means less government revenue to spend on benefits, and less to spend on education and health and other benefits which decrease income inequality and improve equality of opportunity.



Joe Hockey’s budget contradicts his own statements about what it is meant to achieve. In his speech, Hockey suggested that he admires “Australians’ egalitarian concerns forfairness”. He may “admire” those concerns but his budget displays he does not share them.",Joe Hockey: all's fair in welfare and budgets,http://www.theguardian.com,[Greg Jericho],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402873683114/73ced092-023d-4156-b419-c699e745b735-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=859637417d70dc50fd18ffd43dbf4ac1,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/jun/16/joe-hockey-alls-fair-in-welfare-and-budgets
745,"BT is on the slide on renewed concerns about its pension deficit.

A weekend report said a three yearly review of the telecoms group's scheme was likely to show a 50% jump in the deficit to around £6bn. So BT would have to increase its contributions, which could leave it with less cash to spend on its battle with BSkyB over sports rights, according to the Sunday Times.

The news has sent BT shares 10.8p lower to 383.5p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. The earlier occupier of that unwelcome position, Smith and Nephew, has recovered some ground despite potential predator Meditronic turning its attentions elsewhere. Smith and Nephew is down 6p at £10.65, having fallen as low as £10.35.

Elsewhere Rolls-Royce has dropped 23p to 997p as analysts at Societe General moved from hold to sell and cut their target price from £10.70 to 950p, ahead of an investor day on Thursday. They said:

A detailed agenda has not yet been released but the company has indicated that senior management will discuss the group's strategy, management's thoughts on capital allocation and M&A and future communication around guidance and TotalCare accounting.



We do not expect any groundbreaking new information to emerge. Indeed we expect some concerns over the outlook for 2014 earnings given management guidance of a strong second half bias to the results and uncertainty over the group's interest in [Finnish group] Wärtsilä. We have trimmed 2015-16 earnings per share estimates mainly to reflect the recent divestment of Energy.



We see some risk of a further earnings downgrade given the guidance of 1/3:2/3 sales and earnings before interest and tax phasing between the first and second half this year. This is a major change from the more typical 45-47%:55-53% split of previous years and leaves the group a lot to do in the second half to make the guidance.



In view of management's desire to maintain a strong balance sheet, we think any potential combination with Wärtsilä would require a major equity element. Our simulation of a Wärtsilä acquisition based on various bid premia indicates that a hypothetical deal would be value destroying under most scenarios. It would also dilute the group's civil aerospace business which is a major attraction of the group for many investors. Given these concerns on both earnings outlook and corporate intent, we conclude that the shares could continue to underperform civil aerospace peers.

747,"Ahead of this week's trading update, department store group Debenhams has edged higher following some positive broker comment.

Its shares are up 1.2p or 1.6% at 72.45p as Barclays moved from underweight to equal weight and raised its price target by 14% to 73p. Analysts Christodoulos Chaviaras and Claire Huff said the company's challenges were now reflected in the valuation:

While we do not yet have reason to believe that online has stopped being margin dilutive, the 30% cuts to Reuters consensus earnings per share estimates in the last 7 months likely reflect this negativity midterm. Near-term sales and margins seem to have stabilized on favourable weather and easy comparisons. A recent roadshow we had with management didn't reveal anything incrementally negative. Debenhams is now a consensus ""sell"" contrary to 7 months ago. The shares have underperformed the FTSE by 33% over the same time frame and absent another profit warning (which we do not perceive as likely) we believe Debenhams is now fairly valued on 9 times 2015's estimated. We raise our second half gross margin by 30 basis points to reflect improved current trading and raise our 2014 estimated earnings per share by 7%.



Not everyone is so positive. Jefferies said it expected the third quarter update to highlight its shift away from sales growth towards cash gross profit:

We forecast group like for like sales growth of -1.0% and total sales growth of -0.3%, both negatively impacted around 2% by management's decision to delay the summer sale by two weeks. We think it's too soon and too risky to buy into a potential profit recovery.



Whilst Debenhams continues to promote, the depth and breadth of discounting appears to be reducing. This is hard to audit but, as an example, we note dresses have 20% off this year, compared to 25% off last year. This alone, however, does not make for sustainable improved profits.



Chief executive MIchael Sharp set out his detailed five strategic priorities in April, which, as a brief reminder, involved 1) reducing promotions, 2) improving the multi-channel offer, 3) driving a better return on stores by redeploying excess space, 4) accelerating international growth and 5) improving operational effectiveness. In essence the strategy sounds reasonable but the execution of it will be difficult. Operating margins fell 230 basis points in the first half of 2014 and we estimate will fall 200 basis points in the full year to 5.4%. At this low level of margin every percent of like for like sales, gross margin or operating expenditure matters and a strong chief financial officer is required.

Weekend reports suggest that Debenhams was looking at ex-New Look finance director Alistair Miller to fill that role, so analysts will be expecting an update at Friday's announcement. They will also be keen to hear how Debenhams plans to link up with Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International, which could use some of the department store group's excess space.

Elsewhere 888 has dropped 5.2p to 112.3p after news of a fall in online gambling revenue in New Jersey in May. Numis said:

May revenue of $10.5m was down 8% (poker down 12%, casino down 7%) versus April ($11.4m). May has one day more than April. Borgata/PartyPoker remained market leader with $4.0m, down 2% (38% share). Caesars/WSOP/888 had $2.8m of revenue, down 9% (27% share). Betfair revenue was down 27% (6% market share).



We would have preferred to see higher revenues but the potential remains for an acceleration later in the year as payment and geolocation problems are resolved. Marketing, too, has yet to get fully into its stride. The high market shares for brands powered by bwin.party and 888 endorse their potential if other states choose to regulate internet gambling.

749,"Possible predator Medtronic unveils offer for Irish group and plan to relocate for tax reasons

Smith and Nephew is leading the FTSE 100 lower as hopes of a bid for the medical equipment group faded.

There had been speculation that US rival Medtronic could be interested in a takeover of the UK hip and knee implant specialist. But Medtronic has now agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien for $42.9bn and relocate to Ireland for a lower tax rate.

With another potential predator Stryker ruling out a bid earlier, Smith and Nephew's shares have lost some of their takeover froth, falling 26p to £10.45. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, told Reuters:

We've seen a couple of deals that haven't materialised, and if you've got people hanging on for these rumours and there isn't anything else on the horizon, it's a good time to get out of them.

EasyJet has dipped 20p to £14.37 following reports in Germany that Lufthansa was considering setting up a new low-cost platform to compete with the budget carriers.

Airlines were also weaker as the oil price held steady at more than $113 a barrel in the wake of the violence in Iraq.

Commodity companies and exploration groups gained ground on the strong crude price, with BHP Billiton 27p better at £18.77 and Rio Tinto rising 25.5p to £30.43 as Exane BNP Paribas issued an outperform rating. Tullow Oil has added 9p to 850.5p.

A rise in the gold price as investors seek havens from the potential storm has helped push Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo 21p higher to 828p and Russia's Polymetal up 26p to 564p.

751,"Sir Philip Green's investment clearly added some lustre to the online retailer, but the shares slumped on debut amid confusion over its listing price

It was amateur hour at flash-sale online retailer Mysale, where somebody programmed the shares to trade in pounds rather than pence. Thus the advertised float price of 226p became £2.26, apparently causing confusion in places where they rely on computers, rather than human beings capable of adapting to an obvious mistake, to make decisions.

Ultimate responsibility for the error lies with the nominated adviser – in this case Australian outfit Macquarie Capital. Whether the cock-up was the only reason why Mysale's shares fell 20% from the listing price is open to question, however.

The main point of interest about this company is that Sir Philip Green's Shelton Capital bought a 25% stake last month. But Green's outfit paid £48m for that slice, the equivalent of about 146p a share. The Arcadia's tycoon's investment clearly added some lustre to Mysale, and will bring commercial opportunities in time with access to some of his Arcadia brands, but the idea that the company's value has risen by 55% in the space of a month seems far-fetched.

767,"Electric carmaker Tesla Motors is handing over the keys to its technology in an unusual effort to encourage other automakers to expand beyond gasoline-burning vehicles.

Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, promised on Thursday to give away the company’s entire patent portfolio, as long as they promised not to engage courtroom battles over intellectual property.

“If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal,” Musk wrote in a blog on the company’s website.

The decision opens the door to more collaboration with Tesla, which is already making electric systems for Daimler and Toyota. Other automakers using Tesla’s technology could potentially share the cost of Tesla’s charging stations, for example. And more charging stations could entice sceptical buyers to try electric cars.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tesla Model S test drive in London

Seven years after Tesla introduced the Roadster electric sports car – which it no longer makes – electric cars still make up less than 1% of US sales. Drivers remain concerned about their range and the lack of places to get a charge. Stable gasoline prices have also hurt sales.

Musk wants Tesla to help change that. The Palo Alto, California-based company currently makes one vehicle – the $70,000 Model S sedan – and is developing two others. Its Model X crossover is due out next year, and Tesla wants to start making a cheaper model by 2017. It’s currently scouting locations for a $5bn battery factory to increase supplies.

But Musk said Tesla can’t make a dent in the market by itself, and thinks the patents could be a “modest” help to other companies developing electric cars. He says Tesla has gotten few requests for technology from rivals, but he thinks that’s partly because patents were blocking access.

“If we can do things that don’t hurt us and help the US industry, than we should do that,” he said.

Musk said Tesla discussed a potential Supercharger partnership with BMW this week. Currently, Tesla has about 100 Supercharger stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances, and it plans to open more in China and Japan this year. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes.

BMW spokesman Kenn Sparks confirmed the meeting.

Nissan, which makes the electric Leaf, had no comment on Tesla’s action. The Leaf only goes 84 miles on a battery charge, compared with up to 265 miles with a Model S. But the Model S has a much larger battery and costs twice as much as a Leaf.

Prashand Kumta, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s school of engineering, said Tesla’s lithium-ion battery technology isn’t unique. But how the company packages that technology and designs its cars could be useful to other companies.

At the start of this year, Tesla had been issued 203 patents covering its batteries and other key features that distinguish its electric cars from gasoline-powered vehicles. Another 280 patent applications are still pending in the US and other countries, according to Tesla’s regulatory filings.

The earliest any of Tesla’s current patents expires is in 2026, so the company is relinquishing a potentially valuable long-term advantage by giving away its intellectual property to its rivals.

But other companies have shown that technology giveaways can pay off. Even though it spent millions designing Android, Google made the software available to all comers at no charge. Google was more interested in expanding the market for mobile devices and ensuring its search engine and other digital services supported by advertising would be prominently featured on them.

The strategy has worked out well for Google so far. Android is now on more than 1bn devices, surpassing Apple’s iOS as the world’s most widely used mobile operating system.

The open-source movement has long appealed to the egalitarian mindset of most technologists, so the patent decision could help recruit talent. Musk named his company for Nikola Tesla, a famous inventor who became so exasperated with the legal system that he finally stopped patenting his ideas.

“Technology leadership is determined by where the best engineers want to work,” Musk said. “Putting in long hours for a corporation is hard. Putting in long hours for a cause is easy.”

Analysts said the announcement has little downside for Tesla, and could solidify its leadership in the market.

“By opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it’s better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one,” observed Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of file-storing company Box Inc.",Tesla hands over the keys to its electric car technology,http://www.theguardian.com,[Associated Press],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/14/1389724251111/d9490de4-945c-49dc-958f-4ea8a586b9eb-620x372.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=7dd30263ffdf57122ece8b31920312a1,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla-elon-musk-electric-cars-patent-technology
769,"If you secretly long to dress like a Queen of Westeros – or Little Red Riding Hood – your moment has arrived

Escapism is one of the pleasures of getting dressed. Fashion's most outlandish fancies are often derided as ludicrous. It's easy (and sometimes fun) to carp ""Would they wear it in Wigan?"" at outré couture, but to do so does rather miss the point. Which is this: what's the use of intelligence without imagination? The two facilities are like chambers of the heart, working together to power not just each person's individual intellect, but – you'd hope – to help our imperfect species progress.

Unreal works of art are an absolutely intrinsic part of human evolution. As Einstein put it: ""If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.""

Grown-ups need fairy tales, too, of course, perhaps now more than ever. The fact that Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games and so many others have navigated the long and perilous journey from the far-flung land of genre fiction all the way to the mainstream certainly attests to our appetite for them. Look ahead to the autumn-winter collections and you'll see fashion's new mood is one of escapism. There were several collections that drew richly on fantasy, folk and fairy tale. A dark dream time lies ahead.

Dolce & Gabbana led us into the forest with a collection that blended historical influences with folk and fantasy – Little Red Riding Hood, Joan of Arc and Maid Marian were all reference points. Meanwhile, at McQueen, Sarah Burton produced clothes fit for a Snow Queen – or should that be a Wildling? Her dramatic collection seemed to be heavily influenced by the chilly bits in Game of Thrones. If you want to introduce a bit of Narnia to your wardrobe before autumn, capes will be a key trend. If you're expecting a few chilly summer evenings and want to get yours early, this Miss Guided one is a reasonable £60, but you will find homemade-looking designer numbers (if such a concept isn't too much of a contradiction) at Anna Sui.

Embroidery is a huge part of this look. The romantic aspect of the folksy stuff that has started to appear on the high street makes it particularly appropriate for weddings.

An occasion is a good excuse to try something ornate like this Asos shift, whereas a more laidback piece is perfect for a festival. (This chambray frock from Sea NY has got Glastonbury written all over it).

White dresses and broderie are a classic summer option and featured heavily at the McQueen show. Try Boden and Dorothy Perkins.

Accessories can be simple leather, or serve as a canvas for everything the folk-tale trend has to offer. Witness this maximalist handbag, which features pompoms, buttons, beading, fringing and mirrors – it's quite literally fantastic.",Game of Thrones hits the high street: dressing Cersei style,http://www.theguardian.com,[Lauren Laverne],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402675789115/Game-of-Thrones-fashion-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=c699f138d307abbb95f5b3ab4518ec43,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/16/fantasy-style-queen-cersei-lannister-lauren-laverne

773,"The former Premier League midfielder on Yaya Touré’s birthday grumbles, fishing mags and getting up close and personal with Papa Bouba Diop

So Jimmy, if you’re talking to Small Talk you must have something to plug. What is it? I’ve got a book out, mate. It took a lot for me to do it because I was wondering why anyone would want to read my stories. I’ve just played football all my life and I really didn’t know what I’d get out of the book, but after I’d spoken to Gersh [Gershon Portnoi], who helped me to write it, five or six times I thought that it might be great to do a book, to share my story and just see how it goes, really.

So how is it going? Now it’s all finished, I’m quite pleased that I have done it. I suppose when it’s your own life you don’t realise what you’ve achieved and what you’ve done until you’ve stepped out and looked back. Doing this book reminded me that, for a bloke who started out in life as a painter and decorator, I’ve achieved some great things and done some stuff I’d always wanted to do. I’ve had some great times.

On the day your book was released, you were sandwiched between Ronnie O’Sullivan and Mike Tyson in the Top 10 of the Amazon sporting autobiographies bestseller list. Is that a place you’re comfortable? Really? Well, Ronnie’s one of my idols, so that’s blinding and Mike Tyson’s an absolute nutcase, so … I suppose I fit nicely in the middle of them two.

So why should people buy your book instead of theirs? Well it’s not for me to tell people what to spend their money on, but mine’s a largely lighthearted book with a few serious bits in it. It was quite an emotional experience doing it because I had a lot of bad times as well as good times in my career. It also has that ‘dream factor’ of a young lad realising his ambition of becoming a top-flight footballer. I’ve had some great times with some top, top managers and I haven’t held back on anything apart from the time I went to battle with Hull in court, because I signed a document which means I can’t talk about it.

What did you make of Yaya Touré’s recent moan about not getting enough respect from his Manchester City overlords on his birthday? Well if he really did say those things … I dunno, if there was a player in my dressing room who moaned about that, I would destroy him. If Yaya has said that, it is outrageous. There must be something else behind it because I’m just not having it that he’s got the hump because the boys ain’t celebrated his birthday.

Bend It Like Bullard is jam-packed with tales of dressing-room pranks and japes you were behind. Would it be fair to say that a lot of your team-mates just found you really tiresome? Yeah, definitely. I fell out with a couple. It’s about managing people and knowing what you can get away with, isn’t it? You’re not exactly going to do a prank on the hardest player at your football club, when you know he’s going to give you a wallop.

But you, ahem, tea-bagged Papa Bouba Diop. The man is a monster. [Laughs] Yeah, good point. I was pushing the limits there, but overall, I think I was quite aware of what I could and could not get away with.

Then there was the time you were at Wigan and your manager Paul Jewell slammed your head in a door. Yeah, Paul was the manager I had who lost it the most. Even if he was winning, sometimes he’d rollock you … it must be the hot Scouser in him. He was always ready to flip, especially when I went to Ipswich and we lost nearly every game, which meant he was boiling every day. But back in his Wigan days, we won a lot so everything was great.

You don’t seem to have had much time for Fabio Capello or his methods, even though he called you up to the England squad. Well, he just didn’t seem to have a lot of methods. I don’t know if it was lost in translation or he found it hard to get his point across, but when I was with England he only spoke to me once or twice. I think it was two sentences, one of which was about golf. In two weeks that ain’t a lot, especially when I was the new kid who had only just come in there. And as for his methods on the pitch, I’ve got to say there weren’t a lot there. But who am I to criticise Capello, because he’s obviously a great manager. This is just me saying what I see and what I felt at the time. I could be wrong.

Do footballers actually enjoy representing England and all the hoopla it entails? Yeah, I don’t think there’s a player that plays for England and doesn’t enjoy it, because it’s an ambition that’s at the top of every footballer’s list: play for your country.

In theory, yes. But the whole experience of being away from home and holed up in a hotel for weeks at a time, constantly being told what to do and when to do it, sounds like a bit of a drag. Well, I can only speak for myself, because I haven’t heard it from anyone else’s lips, but I did find that aspect of it hard. That’s why I have the utmost respect for Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard and David Beckham, who have travelled the world and amassed so many caps, because even though I was only there for two weeks, I did find it difficult. You’re in that hotel – and it’s a lovely hotel – where you eat when you’re told and you can’t really do your own thing … but that’s the profession, isn’t it? That’s where your professionalism comes in and I was probably lacking a little in that department. I loved being part of the England set-up and would love to have had more time in it, but I did find it tough. The great outweighs the tough, but I’m just trying to give a little bit of insight into how I found it.

If Capello had promised you an England cap on condition you shaved off your long golden tresses, would you have done it? Oh, 100%. Of course I’d have done it, but he didn’t even give me that option. He didn’t even offer me that.

After retiring, you tried to make it as a golf pro. Why haven’t we seen you playing in the Ryder Cup or featuring in the news for breaking off your engagement to a famous tennis player? Because I’m not that good. I qualified on the EuroPro Tour last year and gave it a little bash, but to be fair I’ve barely picked up a golf club in three months because I’ve been bang on my fishing. It’s either fishing rods or golf clubs for me, one or the other.

What’s the biggest fish you’ve ever caught? A 22lb carp in Gold Valley Lakes in Aldershot. I caught one yesterday that was about 18lb.

Fishing seems a bit of a sedate pastime for somebody as hyperactive as you appear to be. Ah, you’d think that, wouldn’t you, but I do competitions. It’s match fishing, where you’re very active and always thinking about your next move. It’s quite intense.

What’s the last book you read, that isn’t Bend It Like Bullard? I’ve never read a book.

Really? I’m a magazine man. I read Match Fishing magazine, Pole Fishing magazine, Angling Times, Golf World and Golf Monthly.

What’s the last movie you saw? The Wolf of Wall Street.

What did you make of it? Blinding!

Small Talk thought it was about an hour too long. I loved it. It weren’t long enough for me.

What’s your favourite biscuit? The ones with the fruity edges and the raisins in. I can’t remember what they’re called.

Small Talk once spent a very pleasant and boozy afternoon in The One Bell, which is your father’s pub in Crayford. If you’d been there and we were getting the drinks in, what would you have? You were in my dad’s pub?

Yes. What did you think of it?

It’s a grand spot with a nice big beer garden, although there’s possibly one framed John Terry shirt too many hanging on the wall. But there’s only one John Terry shirt hanging on the wall.

Exactly. Anyway, what’s your poison? I only drink Smirnoff Ice.

The drink of choice for 14-year-olds everywhere. I’m not a big beer drinker. Smirnoff Ice is my tipple and I’m pissed after about three of them.

How much is a pint of milk? I don’t know, but would guess about £1.89.

You’d be getting fleeced if you paid that, Jimmy. Nah, it’s just that I buy the proper stuff.

Who or what would you put into Room 101? Flared trousers.

Miley Cyrus or Rihanna? Blimey … [long pause] … Rihanna.

Cheese or chocolate? Cheese.

What’s the last record, CD or download you bought? Hideaway by Kiesza.

What’s your favourite TV show? Celebrity Juice at the minute.

Have you ever knocked a man out? Clean out, yeah.

Was it anyone we might know? Yeah, Nick Barmby.

What is your favourite pie filling? Apple.

Who would play you in the movie of your life? Small Talk is thinking Jennifer Lawrence for the Peterborough United and early Wigan years, then Goldie Hawn for the rest. Now why would you say that?

No reason. I want Mickey Rourke to play me. Mickey Rourke and his big mullet.

OK, thanks for your time, Jimmy. Thank you.

775,"• Playmaker is man England most fear in World Cup • Roy Hodgson managed him at Internazionale

The ageless Andrea Pirlo has renewed his contract with the Italian champions Juventus until June 2016.

Pirlo, 35, the Italian dangerman against England’s World Cup hopefuls on Saturday, joined Juve from Milan in 2011.

As the club website put it: “For 131 games Andrea Pirlo has been the fulcrum of the side, the intersection through which every move passes.

“Six thunderbolts have been released from his foot this season, 14 goals in total. In three years he’s played his team-mates through on goal 30 times, touching the ball at least once for every minute he’s spent on the pitch (11,551 balls played versus his 11,344 minutes in action), with a pass completion rate of over 90%.”

Roy Hodgson has picked him out as the man England most fear after he destroyed their European Championship hopes in 2012.

Hodgson managed him at Internazionale but felt he never got the best out of him. “Inter let him go to Milan, which showed they didn’t fully believe in him, and it was Carlo [Ancelotti ] who transformed him into a deep-lying midfield player, rather than a second centre-forward.

The Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino has sold Cagliari to an Italian company Fluorsid Group, the Serie A club have announced.

Fluorsid, a chemical company based in Cagliari and owned by the Giulini family, has acquired a 100% stake of the Sardinia football club for a reported €45m (£36m).

A statement from the club read: “Today a contract has been signed for the sale of the 100% stake of Cagliari Calcio to Fluorsid Group.”

Cellino purchased Cagliari in 1992 and had been looking to sell the club since acquiring a 75% stake in Leeds earlier this year.

He revealed last week he had entered negotiations with the Giulini family to hand over the club after the sale of Cagliari to an American consortium group fell through earlier this month.

“During the first few months of 2014, I convinced myself that the time had come to end my 22-year experience at the helm of Cagliari Calcio,” Cellino told the club website.

“They have been intense and marvellous years during which I have experienced unforgettable moments. I want to thank everyone that has accompanied me in this journey.

“The club shareholders have taken a careful decision with regards to the sporting ambitions of the club, the seriousness of the project and the adherence of the territorial values.

“Cagliari Calcio is in need and deserves a precise and ambitious project. Fluorside Group and Tommaso Giulini are a guarantee in this sense. The fans can be calm. Cagliari Calcio will continue a journey of sustainable growth.”

779,"• Turkish side finished runners-up in the Super Lig • Italian linked to Serie A where he won three titles

Roberto Mancini has parted company with Galatasaray by mutual agreement.

In what appears to be a dispute over the club’s future direction, Mancini told Gazzetta dello Sport: “As a coach I understand the demands of the club. However, when I accepted the coaching post, Gala’s aims were different.”

He added: “In the past eight months, despite enduring a challenging start, I have done my job pushed by passion and by hunger which has resulted in the team qualifying for the Champions League, lifting the Turkish Cup and finishing second in the league.

“It’s with sadness that I leave Istanbul and the club’s fantastic supporters.”

The Turkish side finished runners-up in the Super Lig to Fenerbahce and won the Turkish Cup in the Italian’s first year but there has been constant speculation that he was looking to leave Istanbul.

“Our relationship with the coach Roberto Mancini and his contract of employment, which was signed on 1 October, 2013, has been terminated by mutual agreement,” said Galatasaray.

“We wholeheartedly thank him for his success and achievements and wish him happiness in his next mission.”

Mancini, who had two years remaining on his contract, has been strongly linked with a return to Serie A and his former club Lazio where the coach Edy Reja could only lead them to a disappointing eighth in the league.

UNATTACHED, AND AT THE WORLD CUP

“Now that Frank Lampard has been released by Chelsea, he could well be playing at the World Cup without having a club team. Are there any other examples of this happening?” asks Michael McCarthy.

Well, it’s fair to say that judging from our mailbag there have been a few. The most popular suggestion was Gary Breen, who went to the 2002 World Cup with Ireland sans club, after leaving Coventry. His performances there led to suggestions that teams as prestigious as Juventus and Barcelona were keen, and in fact Breen revealed years later that he agreed a deal with Internazionale but failed a medical. In the end he signed for the slightly less-picky West Ham but they were relegated and he only played 18 games. Ah, what could’ve been.

Jeff Lawrence reminds us of the Canada squad in 1986, the only World Cup they have ever qualified for, which had no fewer than six unattached players in it. They were captain Bruce Wilson, midfielder Randy Ragan, defender Randy Samuel, midfielder Greg Ion, midfielder Jamie Lowery and goalkeeper Sven Habermann. This was largely because most of the Canadian side that did well at the 1984 Olympics (Brazil needed a penalty shoot-out to eliminate them) played in the old North American Soccer League, which disbanded in 1985, leaving many unemployed and not everyone managed to find a new team by the following year, relying on indoor football to keep their eyes in.

Meanwhile James Straughan writes: “In 2010 alone there were three; Australia’s Craig Moore & New Zealand’s Simon Elliott and David Mulligan (unused substitute) having left AO Kavala & Wellington Phoenix (x two) respectively.”

“Jay DeMerit for one,” adds Andrew Foulkes. “Watford FC released him before he appeared for the USA in 2010. Modest chap, even by the standards of most Championship-level defenders who self-finance a Hollywood film about themselves though neither back-story or World Cup performances saw him staying in the European leagues thereafter.”

There were also a couple of nominations for the Angola striker Akwa, who was between clubs at the 2006 World Cup, while David Young suggests Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Kelvin Jack, who had been released by Dundee before the same tournament. Tony Cascarino had been released by Chelsea before the 1994 World Cup and would sign for Marseille after it, while Andre Ooijer appeared in the 2010 final despite having no fixed footballing abode.

Jack Deller cranks things up a notch: “How about captaining a side at the Wold Cup finals without a club team? OK, let’s pile it all on - how about captaining the World Cup winning team without a club side - well, almost? Bobby Moore. In 1966 he was out of contract immediately before the World Cup finals and at that time it made him ineligible to play (when did they change the rules, by the way?) It was only when Alf Ramsey realised the danger of losing his captain that Moore was persuaded to sign a new contract with the Irons.”

A few players played their last games of football at the World Cup, having represented their clubs for the last time so were technically free agents. Pat Jennings did this in 1986, after retiring in 1985 while with Arsenal, but he wanted to play in Mexico so signed with Spurs for a year to maintain his fitness, appearing largely in the reserves, and was even briefly on Everton’s books to cover for Neville Southall at the FA Cup final. And then of course Zinedine Zidane went out with quite a bang (on Marco Materazzi’s chest) in 2006.

THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF SQUAD NUMBERS

“Have England ever opened a World Cup tournament with the starting 11 consisting of players with the squad numbers of 1-11?” enquires Matt A. “If so, what was the outcome?”

It’s happened a few times, Matt. Technically they do so in the first World Cup England took part in, which was Brazil 1950. However, no teams had squad numbers in that tournament, so while Walter Winterbottom’s brave boys did trot out for their first game against Chile (a 2-0 win, with goals from Stan Mortensen and Wilf Mannion) with the traditional sequence of numbers on their backs, that isn’t really in the spirit of your question.

Squad numbers were introduced from 1954, and in either a marvellous nod to tradition or a bloody-minded refusal to do anything differently, the English did indeed play their first game with 1-11 upon their shirts. And that was quite a game, as England drew 4-4 with Belgium, initially falling behind to a Léopold Anoul goal, before storming into a 3-1 lead only to be pegged back to take it into extra-time, which was employed to avoid draws in the group stages back then. England then went 4-3 up in the 91st minute through Nat Lofthouse, before heartbreak in the 94th, as a Jimmy Dickinson own-goal gave the Belgians a point. Here is footage of that game, with a suitably cartoon Pathe News-style commentary, which rather hopefully notes at one point that there is space on the scoreboard for double figures.

England did it again in 1958 as they drew 2-2 with the Soviet Union, so the first time they actually started a World Cup with a player not having a number between 1-11 on their shirt was in 1962, when they lost 2-1 to Hungary with Bobby Moore, 16 across his jersey, in defence. They picked up the baton again in 1970, as their 1-0 win over Romania was achieved with the purest of all the numbering systems, No10 Geoff Hurst scoring the only goal. And that, boys and girls, was the last time England opened a World Cup with the starting 11 consisting of players with the squad numbers of 1-11.

THE BIGGEST GAP BETWEEN TOURNAMENTS

“What’s the longest gap between World Cup appearances for a player?” wonders R Reisman. “Has anyone ever missed two tournaments and then come back to play again?”

Yes, is the quick answer. The most obvious and frequently-suggested by our good readers is Michael Laudrup, who appeared in the great Denmark side of 1986 (which, as it happens, you can read all about in this little tome), then had to wait 12 years before he could play in another World Cup, as Denmark failed to qualify in 1990 and 1994. However, he was still around for France 1998, and his last game in that tournament happened to be his final ever game of professional football, also making him a candidate for the first question in this week’s Knowledge.

“Niall Quinn was a member of the Republic of Ireland squad at Italia ‘90,” writes Philip in Dublin. “As he was injured in 1994 and RoI failed to qualify for 1998, Quinn didn’t see the World Cup again until Japan and South Korea in 2002.”

Doug Coyle points out a similar gap between the Costa Rica forward Hernan Medford’s first appearance in 1990 and his last in 2002, but Marcelo Leal has perhaps the definitive suggestion: “Colombian goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón was part of the squad in 1994 (did not play) and 1998 (three appearances) and now, at age 43, is part of the 23-man squad called by José Pekerman. If he manages to stay fit until their first game in Brazil, it will be 20 years since he was first part of a WC squad and 16 since his first WC match.”

WORLD CUP KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE

“Is it true that Chilean players drank vodka during the 1962 World Cup because they thought it would help their chances of beating the USSR?” pondered Steven Davison back in 2006.

Incredibly, Steven, it is. During the group stage, the hosts employed an interesting new tactic of pre-game stereotypical eating: before the opening 3-1 win over Switzerland, they ate cheese, followed by a preparatory meal of spaghetti before the 2-0 success against Italy.

Once in the quarter-finals, the Chileans prepared for their game with the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by downing a couple of Smirnoffs. The ploy actually worked and Chile went on to win 2-1. Coffee was the order of the day before the semi-final with Brazil, but although it perked them up no end in the morning, it couldn’t stop the Brazilians from winning 4-2 and going on to lift the trophy. Eduardo Galeano later wrote in Soccer in Sun and Shadow that Chile “gobbled down spaghetti, chocolate, and vodka, but choked on the coffee”.

CAN YOU HELP?

“Watching this year’s Champions League got me wondering,” wonders Ben McGee. “Has there ever been a year where all 22 starters at the final in a World Cup year have made it into their respective World Cup squads? Conversely, has there ever been a year where none of the starting players made the squads?”

“I like goals,” admits Simon Burslem, “And everyone likes it when their team has a top goal scorer but hate it when they get sold to a rival the following season. My question is … has there ever been a player in Europe who has finished top goal scorer in one season, left his club and then finished top scorer the season after in a different team/ league?”

“In the Danish Superliga, Danny Olsen made a switch from FC Midtjylland to AGF in the January transfer window earlier this year,” begins Mikkel Orlovski. “AGF, and Danny, were relegated. FC Midtjylland were in front for most of the season, and only lost the title in the final few rounds due to a poorly timed run of bad results. Still, it got me thinking; which mid-season transfers have been the worst for a player? Has anyone ever “succeeded” in changing clubs and being relegated with the new team, while the old team won the championship?”

“Marko Marin won the Europa League with Sevilla,” points out Chai from Atlanta. “He had also won the same trophy with Chelsea the year before. Are there any other players who have won the UEFA Cup/ Europa League in consecutive seasons with different teams ?”

Keith Hackett's verdict

1) Tricky. The striker may have faked the whole thing to put the keeper off, but you'd have to be very sure before taking action against him. Technically, he has taken the kick in one movement and scored a valid penalty and the keeper should not have dropped his guard – so award the goal. Thanks to Philip Hawthorn.

2) The manager can indeed replace him in the starting line-up with one of his named substitutes. It just means that his side now has one fewer substitute. Calm everyone down before starting the game and include full details in your report. Thanks to Matt Taylor.

3) Award a penalty for deliberate handball – and caution one of the two players for the offence. This is one piece of advice referees often give to defensive walls – it's fine to deliberately make themselves larger by jumping when the kick is taken, but if their hands are raised in the process the dangers are obvious. Ronnie McNeil wins the shirt.

789,"A kit that shrinks in the wash, 11 players reporting for a training camp and matches cancelled due to a lack of funds – it was never like this for Carlos Queiroz at Manchester United or Real Madrid. He has faced all this and more in the buildup to Brazil as manager of Iran, plus other trappings of the job that were beyond him at Old Trafford and the Bernabéu – acclaim, authority and a respect bordering on reverence from players and supporters alike. Every cloud, as they say.

The widely experienced Portuguese coach has approached the World Cup with an air of defiance and exasperation since guiding Iran to the finals 12 months ago. The highest-ranked Asian team in the tournament are the third nation Queiroz has taken to a World Cup, following South Africa in 2002 and Portugal in 2010, and history suggests they have done well to keep him at the helm forMonday’s opener against Nigeria. He quit South Africa before the 2002 finals over a dispute with the country’s football association (who reportedly want Queiroz back when his contract with Iran expires this summer) but has stomached much more to fulfil his duties with the side known back home as Team Melli.

Maybe he has mellowed with age at 61. Then again, consider his reaction when Iran clinched first place in their Asia qualifying group at South Korea’s expense last June. Queiroz celebrated that crucial victory on South Korean soil with a clenched-fist, up-yours salute to his opposite number Choi Kang-hee, sparking outrage among the home crowd in Ulsan, who pelted his team with water bottles, an attempted rush on the visitors’ bench by Choi’s players and official condemnation from Korea Football Association officials. Perhaps we should discount mellowing.

An alternative theory for Queiroz’s resolve in the face of Iran’s farcical World Cup preparations is that he has attained the level of control, success and credit denied him in previous high-profilepositions.

He has the authority that was never available as assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at United, where Roy Keane was among those who questioned the coach’s input, or while working under Real president Florentino Pérez in Madrid. His disciplined, defensive coaching is more suited to upsetting the odds with Iran than realising the expectations of Portugal’s entertainers and individuals.And, in delivering World Cup qualification to a fanatical football nation during a time of economic turmoil wrought by international sanctions, while taking a hard-line stance with dissenting players and clubs, he has achieved hero status among the fans.

Enhancing that status in a group containing Nigeria, Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina appears a forlorn hope but Iran – who lost only twice in their qualifying campaign and conceded two goals in their final eight matches – may not be prised open easily. Queiroz has drilled his team into a supremely well-organised, diligent defensive unit. Outside of his orderly bubble, unfortunately, there is only chaos.

Iran have played only five warm-up matches since qualifying 12 months ago and no one of the calibre they will confront in Group F, with all due respect to Guinea, Belarus, Montenegro, Angola and Trinidad & Tobago. They have qualified for the 2015 Asian Cup in the meantime, however, against Thailand, Lebanon and Kuwait. If there is sympathy for the government-funded Iran football federation over attracting international teams to Tehran amid US sanctions and an EU embargo – a consequence of the country’s uranium-enrichment programme – then it evaporated over the fiasco of the team’s kit.

The federation claims it has been unable to collect approximately £180,000 owed by international sponsors due to the sanctions. Its response, it has been alleged, was to order poor-quality kit that the federation president, Ali Kafashian, has advised players to wash in cold water to prevent shrinkage. Players have also been asked not to exchange shirts with the likes of Lionel Messi because replacements are in short supply.

“Before crucial qualifying games against Qatar and South Korea, which were played in extreme conditions of humidity, the equipment delivered was not proper. This could have put Iran out of the World Cup,” claimed Queiroz. The striker Karim Ansarifard elaborated: “They give us large-size socks and after two days and being washed they shrink to a small size.” The supplier, German manufacturer Uhlsport, understandably defended its credibility and Queiroz was forced to deny claims his criticism stemmed from a financial dispute with a Dubai-based kit distributor. Whether Iran have been wearing bona fide Uhlsport gear has also been open to question. “The gear that we have now, we really don’t know what it is,” said the striker Mohammad Reza Khalatbari.

The make and eventual size of the Iran shirt that Messi hangs on his wall is notthe only problem. A training camp in Portugal last September that included a friendly against fellow World Cup qualifiers Ghana was cancelled due to a lack of funds, while the decision to hold a get-together in South Africa in April prompted a fierce row between clubs and country. The timing clashed with four teams’ involvement in the Asian Champions League. They refused to release their employees, the camp went ahead with only 11 players and Queiroz, who had successfully appealed for the domestic league to finish early, threatened to omit the no-shows from the World Cup before eventually backing down.

Javad Nekounam, the Iran captain, lamented: “None of the promises turned into realities. If we did not have good preparation games until the games start, there shouldn’t be any expectations. Whatever happens, the authorities must be held responsible for the results.”

Such distractions would be infuriating at the best of times. For a country that desperately craves the release of a World Cup and is passionately behind Queiroz’s team, as shown by the mass celebrations that erupted in Tehran upon qualification, they are lamentable. The starting gun cannot sound quickly enough and Iran must hope a siege mentality has replaced the internal squad divisions that marred previous tournaments. This will be Iran’s fourth World Cup and their record reads three group exits with only one win; albeit the momentous scalp of the USA in 1998.

The prospect of Iran reaching the second round for the first time is remote. But low expectations will suit the defensive approach of their manager whose team is designed to absorb pressure, not concede many and has an experienced central-midfield core of the former Osasuna veteran Nekounam plus Andranik Teymourian, of brief Bolton and Fulham fame. Their problems, on the field at least, rest on their potency when they do have the ball, with the squad lacking a proven goalscorer. Ansarifard’s equaliser in a recent 1-1 draw with Angola was Iran’s first goal in three friendly matches.

Queiroz has scoured the Iranian diaspora for players to join a predominantly home-based squad. Two, Fulham’s German-Iranian Ashkan Dejagah and Charlton Athletic’s Dutch-Iranian Reza Ghoochannejhad, may carry the responsibility up front along with Ansarifard, the more established but hardly prolific threat. Ghoochannejhad only made his international debut with the qualifying campaign under way, and with Iran in trouble, but his nine goals in 11 appearances underpinned an impressive recovery.

“Gucci”, as the 26-year-old is known to his friends, sparked delirium with a confident finish in that win over South Korea. Another upset on the biggest stage of all and we may witness another defiant gesture from Queiroz, with his employer at the Iran football federation on the receiving end.",Carlos Queiroz retaining order amid chaos of Iran’s World Cup buildup,http://www.theguardian.com,"[Andy Hunter, Paul Wilson In Salvador]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/6/15/1402834666646/Carlos-Queiroz-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=e96fa42b0a364ad8b7bad679c8e9e5d1,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/carlos-queiroz-iran-world-cup

The Catalan midfielder, who signed for Chelsea for £27m, said that a clause in his contract gave Arsenal first refusal and that he spoke to Wenger but that in the end the manager decided not to proceed because Mesut Özil now occupies Fàbregas’s position. It was then that José Mourinho convinced him to join Chelsea ahead of the “many” other options he had in the Premier League.

“When I decided that my time at Barcelona had ended, I looked for the best option for me,” Fàbregas explained. “Arsenal was the first option, for contractual reasons. There was a clause that gave them the right to decide. We spoke to Wenger and he said that the space was very well filled by Mesut Özil and it was hard to find a place for both of us in the team.”

795,"Despite a debut World Cup goal Daniel Sturridge admitted he was “disappointed and heartbroken” to finish on the losing side against Italy and vowed the team would bounce back in Thursday’s match with Uruguay.

The Liverpool striker, whose contribution was described as “exceptional” by Roy Hodgson, more than justified the decision to hand him the No9 shirt and start him up front on his own.

Sturridge, who came into the tournament in a rich vein of form and bubbling with confidence, said that, despite his goal, he felt he had let the nation down. “It’s my mum’s birthday on Sunday and I was just trying my heart out to make her happy and put a smile on her face as well,” he said. “Obviously I’m gutted we didn’t win the game because I feel like I’ve let, not just everyone in England but my family down as well.”

Sturridge, like his manager and his captain for club and country, Steven Gerrard, bemoaned England’s bad luck but said there were many encouraging aspects to a sometimes swashbuckling display.

“We played very good football, we were exciting, we looked great going forward, we did defend well,” he said. “It was just one of those nights. Sometimes you don’t get the breaks and those fine inches, where the keeper makes a save or a rebound doesn’t go to you. There are no excuses, we played well – we just didn’t get the result.”

Sturridge referred to England’s two remaining Group D matches – against Uruguay on Thursday and Costa Rica five days later – as cup finals and said that Hodgson’s squad would attack them with a positive attitude.

“I’m disappointed and heartbroken because I do feel we deserved something out of the game,” the 24-year-old said. “But there are two big games. I’m positive, I have got a positive attitude, I’m going into them excited. I’m going into the games knowing we can get something out of them.

“Regardless of the opposition, regardless of the other results, we would have gone into the next game with the same mentality, which is to win anyway.”

Sturridge’s ability to link up with his Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling was one of the more encouraging aspects of England’s display and the striker said they would approach the next two games with similarly attacking intent.

“There were no nerves at all because I know what we’re capable of. People saw that, we knew in training and throughout the week going into this game, feeling extremely confident in ourselves as a team. I just think we didn’t get the breaks but I’m excited for the next game as I know we can do a job on them if we play like we did against Italy, so it’s a good feeling.”

Sturridge was substituted towards the end of the match with a dead leg following a challenge from Giorgio Chiellini but said he was confident of being fit to face Uruguay, who will have to decide whether to gamble on the fitness of his Liverpool strike partner Luis Suárez.

“Chiellini gave me a knee in the thigh and it was quite painful. I tried running it off and kept going and I looked up and saw my number and I was a bit disappointed to come off because I was trying to carry on. These things happen and I’ll be ready. I’ll be all right for Thursday. I’ll get treatment, so I’m sure I’ll be fine.”

Sturridge said he was already impatient for Thursday’s match and that the squad would be ready mentally.

“It seemed such a long week leading up to it. It’ll be the same because, to me, four days seems such a long time to wait for the next game. It will be a long time to mull over a defeat. But at the same time we can take the positives out of the game and we can look forward to the next one.”",Daniel Sturridge gutted after ‘letting everyone in England down’,http://www.theguardian.com,[Owen Gibson],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402855162050/Daniel-Sturridge-012.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=de40805bc22b4dce1c5bb72026b05cc9,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/daniel-sturridge-gutted-after-letting-everyone-in-england-down
797,"• Ethics investigator Michael Garcia quizzed England officials • Any action will be announced in next two months

A payment of £35,000 by England’s 2018 World Cup bid to cover a gala dinner for Caribbean officials is being investigated by the Fifa ethics investigator Michael Garcia, it can be disclosed.

Garcia questioned England 2018 officials about picking up the bill for the Trinidad dinner during interviews in London last year as part of his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The dinner was part of efforts to woo the then influential Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, who has since quit football in disgrace.

Any action from Garcia’s report is likely to be announced within the next two months but sources close to England’s bid say their lawyers are comfortable they did not break any rules. The Football Association would not comment.

It can also be revealed that Garcia is looking into all friendly matches played by bidding nations with the countries of Fifa executive committee members before the 2010 vote.

England’s friendly against Trinidad in June 2008 is unlikely to be called into question as it took place before the bid was officially registered in 2009, even though the FA had announced some time before the match that it was bidding.

However, England 2018 did promise Thailand’s Fifa member an international match but pulled out of the friendly after its humiliating defeat in December 2010. Other bidding countries also staged friendlies against Fifa members’ countries – for example Japan played Guatemala.

Fifa’s bidding rules of conduct stated bidders should refrain from “any benefit, opportunity, promise, remuneration, or service” to any Fifa members, consultants or their families.

The £35,000 gala dinner was for 160 people from the Caribbean Football Union and took place in Port of Spain in February 2010.

It was revealed by Warner on the eve of the event, when he said: “It is costing the FA about £35,000, but I think that is money well spent as it allows them to speak to all 32 countries from the CFU.

“It also means I will be able to get the collective view of my membership about who they think should host the World Cup when the time comes for me to decide who I should vote for.

“And in light of the harsh economic conditions we are battling in the region the FA has agreed to formally partner with us to host the dinner. It is an offer which I have agreed to.”

At the time, England 2018 said the £35,000 payment would allow the CFU to spend the money they save on football projects instead.

David Dein, the former Arsenal and FA vice-chairman, addressed the gala dinner in his role as international president of the 2018 bid team.

The £35,000 is put into the shade by the £1m Qatar 2022 spent sponsoring the Confederation of African Football’s congress and Australia 2022’s £300,000 on a grant to Warner’s Concacaf centre of excellence in Trinidad.

Franz Beckenbauer has hit back at Fifa over his 90-day ban for failing to aid the continuing investigation into corruption allegations surrounding the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and insisted he would cooperate with the inquiry.

In a statement released via his manager, Marcus Höfl, Beckenbauer said he would answer Fifa’s statement within the next two weeks and therefore assumed the ban, which includes his attendance at World Cup games, would be lifted with immediate effect.

But Beckenbauer also criticised Fifa for failing to inform him of its decision before going to the press. The two-times World Cup winner – once as a player, the other as manager – had been “extremely surprised” by hearing of his ban via the news on Friday, even though Fifa’s ethics rules state that any party accused of deliberate breach would be given the chance to release an advance statement.

“It was the first time that Fifa did not know how to contact me by telephone,” said Beckenbauer. “Furthermore I always assumed that I did not have to answer the questions because I no longer hold an official function with Fifa. But that has now been cleared up.”

In the statement, Höfl said Beckenbauer had at no point ruled out answering the questions put to him by Fifa.","Fifa investigates England 2018 World Cup bid over £35,000 payment",http://www.theguardian.com,[Philip Oltermann],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/6/15/1402862818429/Michael-Garcia-Fifa-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=419518f808830c72cc91630ff85ffcde,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/fifa-investigates-england-2018-world-cup-bid-payment
799,"The painful memories of South Africa will soon begin to fade if this is a sign of things to come from France. Inspired by Karim Benzema, who was left out of the squad that created such a furore at the World Cup four years ago, France got off to the perfect start in Brazil with a comfortable victory over a Honduras team who did nothing to alter their reputation for adopting an overly physical approach.

Already controlling the game and unfortunate to hit the woodwork twice early on through Blaise Matuidi and Antoine Griezmann, France never looked back from the moment Benzema converted a penalty just before the interval, after Wilson Palacios had picked up a second yellow card for a moment of stupidity. Palacios’s clumsy, premeditated foul on Paul Pogba, with whom he had clashed earlier, left Honduras facing an exercise in damage limitation.

For France, who had far too much class for limited opponents, never mind a team reduced to 10 men, it became a matter of how much they wanted to twist the knife in the second half. With Yohan Cabaye influential in the centre of midfield, Les Bleus added a second in the 48th minute, when Benzema’s left-footed shot came back off the far upright and Noel Valladares, the Honduras goalkeeper, inadvertently pushed the rebound over the line.

Confusion reigned for a period, not helped by the “no goal” message that appeared on the big screen in the stadium, prompting the Honduras players to surround the referee and complain that the goal should not be allowed to stand. That message, however, was in relation to Benzema’s initial effort and the goal-line technology got it right moments later, when it was confirmed that Valladares had effectively scored an own-goal.

That was the cue for the French to start to enjoy themselves and, with Honduras struggling to contain them, it seemed inevitable that more goals would follow. Matuidi hit the side-netting and Valladares denied Benzema from point-blank range but the veteran goalkeeper was powerless to stop the Real Madrid striker from adding his second of the night – a fierce angled drive into the roof of the net – 18 minutes from time.

It was no more than France and Benzema deserved. On this evidence the striker is determined to make up for lost time and make his first World Cup one to remember. He was a constant menace against Honduras and it was hard to reconcile his performance with the man who had endured a run of 15 matches without a goal for his country before he scored against Australia in October. He has now registered eight in his last seven matches for France.

Didier Deschamps was delighted with the outcome. “A marvellous start,” the France manager said. “We had a high-quality team in front of us with high aggressiveness. We hit the bar twice and finally the penalty and the red card changed the situation. We could have scored even more.”

Asked about the confusion with the goal-line technology, Deschamps said there needs to be greater clarity. “It’s a good solution and the goal counts. The referee gets the signal. We were just worried they showed an image that does not correspond to the goal, when it hit the post. Only when the keeper pushes it into the goal, it counts. They were nervous and so were we. If the image is to be shown it must be the one that backs up the referee’s decision.”

The only other moment of concern for France was when Pogba kicked out at Palacios after the two tangled midway through the first half, prompting a mêlée and a couple of yellow cards. Pogba was enraged with Palacios for stamping on him and on another night could have easily been dismissed for retaliating.

“He was tackled very badly. He had a reaction and it could have had consequences,” Deschamps said. “I warned [Patrice] Evra, Cabaye and Pogba at half-time and told them to watch out and not finish up with 10 on the pitch.”

Palacios could have no complaints about his red card, after he blatantly shoved Pogba in the back in the area. Luis Fernando Suárez, the Honduras manager, said that the Stoke City midfielder “made a mistake” but he insisted that his players were not guilty of being too aggressive.

“We didn’t cross the line. We have a strong, intense style but we always respect the rules of the game. If at some point we don’t, then the referee has to take a decision and give us a red card. And we have to accept the consequences.”",World Cup 2014 Group E match report,http://www.theguardian.com,[Stuart James],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402865963753/Karim-Benzema-France-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=df883024f079f0824668f0df11cdb4c3,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/france-honduras-world-cup-2014-group-e-match-report
801,"Joachim Löw has stated that all his players are “100% fit” after alarms were raised by Bastian Schweinsteiger being airlifted out of the German training camp for hospital tests on his right knee.

“It was just a formality,” the Germany coach explained. “Fifa require all players with reported injuries to be checked out for insurance reasons.

“Sami Khedira, Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer were all scanned in Munich, but Bastian was not so he had to get it done out here. His knee problems are completely resolved – it was simply an extra check at Fifa’s request.”

Schweinsteiger is not certain of starting against Portugal in Salvador on Monday in any case. Löw’s decision to bring Lahm into midfield to help Jérôme Boateng means that Schweinsteiger or Khedira is likely to miss out. Germany would be set up too defensively with both of them and Toni Kroos may be the other midfielder.

Löw’s intention, especially in a tough opening game, is to make his Germany side difficult to beat. “I believe we are well prepared,” he said. “We can draw on a lot of quality and talent and the task now is to perform to a high level over four weeks. We did well in 2010 but with a number of players appearing in their first tournament we couldn’t quite keep it up.

“This time our priority is to focus on the title, try to reach the final match, and to do that we will need to use the whole squad. I think we can make it really far in this tournament but we need to keep going for the duration, you cannot win a title with just four or five good games.”

Neuer, the goalkeeper who was initially a fitness worry but now has the all-clear to start, is back in full training and feels upbeat about his own condition and his team’s prospects. “We can be dangerous at World Cups,” he said. “Germany is a team that can develop momentum during tournaments.”

That is true, but with no World Cup success since 1990, when the team was still playing as West Germany, Neuer accepts that pressure is growing for Löw and his players to deliver. “Of course it is,” he said. “Obviously we are not the only country that haven’t won the World Cup for a while, others are waiting too, but the expectation in Germany rises as each tournament goes by.

“I do feel that pressure but I enjoy it. I need to feel pressurised, it’s not a negative thing. Pressure is what stimulates us all and brings out the very best in the players at tournaments.”

Germany are in a tough group, with Ghana and the USA, and Neuer would not be drawn on whether they are favourites for the first game, let alone the tournament. “I don’t know if Cristiano Ronaldo is fully fit, we’ll have to wait and see, but at the top of his form he is one of the most dangerous players in football.

“Portugal have put together winning streaks in previous tournaments. This is not an easy match. To be honest I don’t think we will get any easy matches in this group. It is dangerous to imagine anyone can regard themselves as favourites and just swagger through the group stage expecting to finish in first place.”

While a helicopter might have been spotted at the German training base, Löw knew nothing of the France manager Didier Deschamps’s suspicions that a drone with a spy camera had flown over the French camp.

“I didn’t see anything like that at our training camp,” he said, on being informed of the French claim. “It wouldn’t be a major concern for us anyway. Such an action would not necessarily reveal any team strategies.”",Germany injury problems dismissed by Joachim Löw as Portugal test arrives,http://www.theguardian.com,"[Paul Wilson In Salvador, Paul Wilson]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402852225190/Germany-coach-Joachim-L-w-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=228704d58eef422002c2632d311797a1,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/germany-injury-problems-dismissed-joachim-low-portugal-world-cup
803,"• Zenit striker could not complete Brazil training match • Hulk ‘hopes to be 100 percent’ for match in Fortaleza

Brazil striker Hulk limped out of a training session on Sunday morning but later said his injury was not serious and he expects to be fit for Brazil’s World Cup match against Mexico on Tuesday.

The Zenit St Petersburg striker was playing for Brazil’s first string against a second string team in a training match, but limped off the pitch after scoring. He received treatment on the touchline but was unable to continue and the training complex.

“I felt a niggle and came off as a precaution,” he told reporters shortly before the squad were due to fly to the northern city of Fortaleza.

“I am good, I am happy and I hope to be 100 percent in two days for the next game. I hope it wasn’t anything serious, I feel good.It’s a normal pain. If I feel anything at all I come off to treat it.”

Hulk had a similar issue ahead of the opening 3-1 win over Croatia last week, but played 68 minutes before being replaced by Bernard. The striker has been a regular starter under Luiz Felipe Scolari, and has personal reasons for particularly wanting to play in Fortaleza.

“I am from the northeast and my family is going to be there,” he said. “It is a game that I don’t want to miss. I want to play and I am going to be ready, God willing.”

Should Hulk be unable to start against Mexico in the Group A game, Ramires looks the most likely to step into Brazil’s starting eleven.

805,"Back at Fuente de la Hispanidad in San Pedro, one of those squares that seems made for mass celebration, the scenes were predictably wild. They arrived in their droves to drink, dance and jump in the fountain and what fired the party was the sheer improbability of it all.

Costa Rica had previously won only three games at World Cups and at half-time of the Group D opener here in Fortaleza, as they trailed 1-0 to a Uruguay team of pedigree, the odds were against them improving the statistic. What followed was one of those adrenaline-fuelled episodes that highlights the World Cup’s capacity to unify nations and create heroes. There were plenty of them in Costa Rica shirts after three unanswered goals sent tremors across Uruguay but there was no doubting who had top billing.

Joel Campbell is something of an enigma in English eyes. Signed from Saprissa in August 2011 by Arsenal, the 21-year-old has yet to play for the London club, having spent season-long loans at Lorient, Real Betis and, most recently, Olympiakos. Initially he had to move because he lacked a permit to work in England but, after it was granted in the summer of last year, he still went to Olympiakos.

Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has played the long game with Campbell and he says that the forward will report back for pre-season training, but the summer has a decisive feel to it. . Campbell has two years to run on his contract and, according to Paulo Wanchope, the Costa Rica assistant manager, he is determined to stay at Arsenal and to finally make his mark on the Premier League.

Arsenal undoubtedly need another striker for next season, having released Nicklas Bendtner and with the load heavy on Olivier Giroud. They have been linked to a host of stellar names but Campbell wants to show the solution is already on the payroll. If he can replicate the performance that destroyed Uruguay in Costa Rica’s ties against Italy and England, his case will become persuasive.

He offered a glimpse of his potential on the big stage for Olympiakos against Manchester United in the Champions League last season, when he scored with a curling shot from 25 yards in the first leg of the last-16 tie. But Saturday at the Estádio Castelão was more impressive.

He stamped the force of his personality on the game, running hard and fast at the Uruguay defence even in the first half when Costa Rica were second best. His touch was inventive and he outlined the long-range shooting threat that he carries in his left boot with one effort that screamed narrowly wide.

Campbell cut loose in the second half and his equalising goal was marked by the instinct of a predator. He sniffed out the space inside the area to meet Cristian Gamboa’s cross before getting the ball down with his chest and lashing it home. There was also a wonderful curling effort from distance that drifted inches past the target and the incisive pass for the third goal, scored by the substitute Marcos Ureña.

Uruguay had no answers, apart from to take out their frustration on Campbell’s shins. Diego Lugano, the captain, was booked for a cynical trip as he burst clear while Maxi Pereira was sent off for kicking him up in the air– a reckless act of indiscipline.

“Joel really wants to go back to Arsenal and play and I told him that the only way to do that was by performing on the pitch,” Wanchope said. “He did well against Uruguay and I think that he needs to perform even better against Italy and England to have that chance to go back to Arsenal. I’m sure that Arsène Wenger will have a look at him.”

“It’s absolutely right that Joel should be at a big club,” added Keylor Navas, the Costa Rica goalkeeper, who made an acrobatic save to deny Diego Forlán at 1-0. “He’s very young but with so much talent. He’s fundamental to our team and he can carry on having a big impact here. He’s not going to let one performance go to his head. He’s a good lad, who listens to the advice of the older players. He’s taken it in his stride.”

It is all happening for Campbell, both on and off the field – his girlfriend is pregnant and he celebrated his goal by tucking the ball under the front of his shirt. Can he make it at Arsenal? He has the pace and raw ability but the question will have to wait for another day. Apart from confirming that he wanted to make a name for himself in the Premier League Campbell did not want to talk about club issues.

His focus is on a thrilling World Cup opportunity and remaining the toast of the Costa Rican support, hundreds of whom celebrated on Saturday night outside the team’s hotel on Fortaleza’s Beira Mar Avenue.

“The supporters are our driving force,” Campbell said. “It really makes us happy to see them outside the hotel and you carry that in your heart on the pitch. The idea of losing never came into our heads and I dedicate my goal to my family, my girlfriend and our child, who is on the way. Was it the most important goal of my life? I hope the most important is still to come.”",Joel Campbell boosts case for Arsenal recognition in Costa Rica win,http://www.theguardian.com,[David Hytner],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402852936058/Joel-Campbell-Costa-Rica-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=86ee80d6bb5132cb2e87cafdb01e6b2a,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/joel-campbell-arsenal-recognition-costa-rica-world-cup
807,"While Portugal taking on Germany is Group G’s undoubted marquee game, the USA’s match against Ghana is what the US coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, has called “a final of sorts”.

You can see his point. This is a game that both teams need to take something out of to have a realistic chance of progressing, given what follows for both. Klinsmann may like to point to World Cup history and note that “nobody will panic” if the USA do not get a win against Ghana, since they have already beaten Portugal in a World Cup finals in 2002, but there’s a flipside to that sort of logic. If we are looking at World Cup history, Ghana have been the USA’s nemesis in the last two tournaments.

In 2006, Ghana were “just” the latest first-time qualifiers out of Africa when they came up against a USA team quietly confident of building on their quarter-final run in 2002. Instead the US were bundled out with defeat to the Ghanaians, and when given the chance of revenge in the second round four years later they were bundled out again, by an Asamoah Gyan goal in extra time.

And bundled is the operative word. Both the standout goals from those defeats saw US players muscled off the ball in the physical counter-attacking style Ghana have perfected. As the 2010 USA coach, Bob Bradley, has noted, this is a team who dare you to attack them then pounce in numbers on any individual errors to counter. Bradley should know — he was also coach of the Egypt team pummelled 6-1 by Ghana in the first leg of their playoff game for these finals.

It is a slightly different looking Ghana team than the 4-1-4-1 that lined up in support of the lone frontman Gyan in 2010. He is still around but under the coach Kwesi Appiah they have tended to play a 4-4-2, with Majeed Waris playing alongside Gyan. But with Waris a doubt, it is possible that they will play a 4-2-3-1 with Kevin-Prince Boateng playing behind Gyan and tasked with not just supporting the attack, but shoring up the centre where Michael Essien and Sulley Muntari may have problems late on.

Boateng too is a little bit of a doubt, sitting out part of the final training sessions. Should Ghana not risk him, Jordan Ayew will be the likely secondary attacking player, though he is still likely to play deeper rather than alongside Gyan.

Gyan himself will be enough of a handful to give the likely US starting defensive pair of Geoff Cameron and Matt Besler a problem. With Fabian Johnson getting forward from full-back on the side Gyan likes to power down, these two will be crucial. That said, so will their occasionally erratic counterparts on the Ghana team.

With Jozy Altidore demonstrating he can still be a danger with his second goal in the friendly against Nigeria last week, Jonathan Mensah and John Boye will have to demonstrate a discipline that is not always a strong suit.

The game will likely be determined in midfield though. Against Nigeria, Klinsmann adjusted the midfield diamond he has been experimenting with in recent games to accommodate three players – Kyle Beckerman, Jermaine Jones and Michael Bradley – who at various points in qualifying had rotated into the two deep-lying slots in a 4-2-3-1. With Bradley now pushed forward as the fulcrum of the team on both sides of the ball, and Jones given more of a roving brief, the balance of the USA side has shifted up the field a little, allowing/necessitating Beckerman as the more defensive midfielder.

How the USA integrate these players and their duties, with the pinched-in wide men of Alejandro Bedoya and Clint Dempsey, not to mention the scoring-just-in-time Altidore, will determine their attacking success. If they can combine that with defensive compactness to thwart the supply to Gyan, and keep the defensive discipline to stop the Ghana counter-attackers from pouncing, they may yet change recent history. The latter may be a big if, especially with forecast heavy rain making errors likely, but Klinsmann at least feels he has the moving parts in place now. Now it is down to how they move.",Jürgen Klinsmann’s USA hoping for third time lucky against Ghana,http://www.theguardian.com,[Graham Parker],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402845775058/J-rgen-Klinsmann-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=adc4462361c2db441693a337f4360d78,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/jurgen-klinsmann-usa-ghana-world-cup-brazil
809,"Two days of almost constant rainfall has caused a landslide that destroyed two homes and forced the evacuation of 50 more in Natal, where the USA will face Ghana on Monday, but Jürgen Klinsmann said on the eve of the game that the conditions would not be an issue for his team.

A torrential downpour began over the coastal city on Friday afternoon, shortly before Mexico’s match against Cameroon, and did not let up until Sunday lunchtime. A spokesman for the fire department informed reporters on Sunday that there had been no casualties caused by the weather but further heavy rain is expected in the next 24 hours, leading to concern about the state of the pitch at the Arena das Dunas.

“We’ve been fine with all the conditions so far,” Klinsmann said at the stadium. “Our training session yesterday, yes, it was wet but that’s it. We’ll just take it the way it is. When you play in Concacaf you’re always going into different countries [with different conditions] and you make the most of it. If it doesn’t go OK, you learn a lesson.”

That message was echoed by the midfielder Michael Bradley, who dismissed the weather as nothing more than a minor factor in Monday’s match. “I think for anybody who has watched any of the games so far in the tournament, whether it was Mexico here in Natal or Ivory Coast/Japan last night, the weather is what it is.

“As players it’s not something we can control. Certainly the pitch here looked like it held up really well in the Mexico game. But we’re not worried about little details like whether it’s raining or the sun’s out. We’re just excited to get out on the field.”

Enthusiasm does seem to be running high in the USA camp, before a match that will be critical to their chances of progressing beyond the group stage. American supporters have travelled in huge numbers to this tournament, with the Natal-based newspaper Novo reporting that as many as 20,000 could attend the Ghana game.

That estimate may be a touch high but several thousand had indicated their intention to attend a night-before party organised by US Soccer for Sunday evening in Natal. The American Outlaws supporters’ group chartered two full planes carrying more than 500 people to Natal and had the demand to fill many more.

They hope to see their team gain some measure of revenge against Ghana, who eliminated them from the last two World Cups. Klinsmann, though, was keen to play down that particular narrative.

“I don’t think it’s a revenge,” said Klinsmann. “Maybe the players who were there four years ago, if they want to get some extra energy and kick out of that, it’s all right with me. But we are really excited to get this started here tomorrow. We worked hard for it, we had three send-off games, we had endless scrimmages and we are full of confidence to play Ghana. Ghana are a team full of individual talent, as you know, but we are full of confidence.”

Klinsmann also elaborated on the role that Berti Vogts will play for his team in this tournament. The former World Cup winner, brought in as a special adviser, will sit in the stand during games before coming down to the changing room at half-time to lend guidance. “To have someone like him be a mentor on your side, it’s a huge value for us,” added Klinsmann.

On paper the USA go into this match as favourites, sitting 13th in Fifa’s world rankings, while their opponents have slipped to 37th. But the Black Stars’ captain, Asamoah Gyan, believes that his nation has the more technically gifted group of players.

“Statistically, [rating America ahead of Ghana] is the right thing,” said Gyan. “But there have been a lot of surprises in the tournament so far … I think Ghana is the more talented team. We have got young, talented players who are coming up. I am a Ghanaian and I am expecting a win tomorrow. But I know they are expecting a win, too.”

The Red Bulls may have got their excuses in early, with a studied public indifference about Saturday night's game, which their hosts had billed as the ""battle for New York"" — but in truth they had little to complain about as the Cosmos outshot them 21-3, including the three that mattered. The Red Bulls found themselves well beaten by a spirited and organized Cosmos team, who may soon find themselves sidelined by the Red Bulls incipient MLS rivalry with New York City FC, but will enter that era, they will believe, as the unofficial champions of the city.

A crowd of 9364 were at the stadium for a competition that's usually a curio in the US soccer calendar, but which had acquired added significance locally when the Cosmos beat Brooklyn Italians to set up the game with the Red Bulls — the one competition the teams could meet in given the absence of promotion and relegation in the US pyramid.

Not that those present were entirely concerned with parochial matters — special screens were set up around the stadium to show the England-Italy World Cup game before this game started, but those in the stands and those in the fields carried plenty of local history into the match, with both coaches being former players for the Metrostars (the previous incarnation of the Red Bulls).

There were back stories around the field too. The Cosmos, who have just finished their spring season in the North American Soccer League, had played a near first choice team featuring former Red Bull Carlos Mendes as their captain, and former MLS player and one-time US national team hopeful Danny Szetela in midfield.

The Red Bulls meanwhile, took the chance to give further experience to the likes of Chris Duvall Ambroise Oyongo and Matt Miazga at the back, but a near first choice of available midfield and forward players showed that coach Mike Petke was taking the game seriously, with former PSG striker Peguy Luyindula and Bradley Wright-Phillips leading the attack.



The Cosmos started nervously, with poor touches conceding the ball to their visitors all over the field in the opening minutes, yet went ahead after just eight minutes against the early run of play.

Carlos Mendes the former Red Bulls defender who now captains the Cosmos, sent a long forward ball down the right of the Red Bulls defense, catching first time left back Ambroise Oyongo out of position. Cosmos striker Mads Stokkelien strode into the space behind him and hit a shot on the bounce past Red Bulls keeper Ryan Meara from a narrow angle.

It wasn’t the last time Meara would be in action in a turbulent first half, as the Red Bulls keeper struggled in the windy conditions against numerous Cosmos set pieces, one of which led to a loose ball in the box that Mendes crashed off the underside of the crossbar with Meara beaten.

The Red Bulls, for their part, were finding it hard to get through an organized Cosmos defense, and it wasn't until more than half an hour had elapsed that Cosmos keeper Jimmy Maurer had to make a save, from a slashing Johnny Steele shot across goal. It heralded a brief period of Red Bulls dominance, with Lloyd Sam’s speed and directness causing problems on the right wing, but before half time the Red Bulls were reeling again as first Alessandro Noselli headed just over the bar, then Sebastian Guenzatti played a one-two with Stokkelien before poking the ball narrowly wide.

The Red Bulls re-organized for the second half, withdrawing Johnny Steele and bringing on forward Andre Akpan, though didn’t make any immediate headway. Indeed the next best chance went to Guenzatti in the 72nd minute, when a soft, but well-placed shot forced Meara to parry round the post.

Then a minute later, the Cosmos doubled their lead. Szetela swung a cross to the back post, and there was Stokkelien again, for another cool finish across Meara.

The Red Bulls looked spent, and the rout was complete when Noselli wriggled into space in the box and hooked a shot past Meara from near the penalty spot in the 78th minute, before the Red Bulls' misery was completed when Chris Duvall's wild challenge in the 88th minute saw him pick up a straight red card.

A lone red flare was lit by the dwindling numbers of Red Bull fans in the stands as the seconds counted down to the inevitable. They'll claim not to care overly about this result in a secondary competition, but the manner of the defeat was alarming for even the most die-hard of fans. For the night, New York soccer turned Green.

813,"Didier Drogba says that his Ivory Coast team-mate Serge Aurier has the capacity to step up seamlessly to the Premier League if and when a mooted transfer takes place.

The Toulouse right-back has been linked persistently to Arsenal, who are searching for reinforcements after Bacary Sagna completed a move to Manchester City, and enhanced his prospects with a decisive performance in the 2-1 win over Japan.

Aurier produced two crosses within three second-half minutes to turn the Group E match on its head, his flat, accurate deliveries met by headers from Wilfried Bony and Gervinho. It was an impact that prompted Drogba, who was introduced as a substitute with his side a goal down, to predict a continued rise for the 21-year-old.

“Serge brought us energy and balance and he had a fantastic game,” Drogba told Fifa.com. “He’s the best right-back in all of France. I think he’ll do well at the next level too, in the Premier League.”

Aurier, whose assists came on his World Cup debut, said that his achievement was difficult to take in. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “It’s my first World Cup, we’re here in Brazil and I helped the team to win. It’s like a dream.”

An attack-minded right-back, Aurier scored six goals in Ligue 1 last season for a Toulouse side that finished in ninth place. His has been a steep rise to prominence: he only made his Ivory Coast debut on 8 June last year, and he was playing for the French second tier side Lens as recently as 2012.

Ivory Coast contest their second group game on Thursday, facing Colombia in Brasilia. Drogba, their captain, believes that an injection of youth into what had been an ageing side – the likes of Aurier and Swansea striker Bony coming to the fore – has given cause for optimism. “It’s good to see we have a new generation coming through,” he said. “This is what we need and it’s good for our football. It gives us energy. It gives us spirit.”","Serge Aurier can thrive in the Premier League, says Didier Drogba",http://www.theguardian.com,[Nick Ames],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/6/15/1402828524623/Serge-Aurier-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=3efdb7e420e375429ba359c1675c10a9,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/serge-aurier-premier-league-didier-drogba-arsenal
815,"Southampton are expected to finalise the appointment of Ronald Koeman as their new manager after the former Holland defender agreed a contract to succeed Mauricio Pochettino over the weekend.

Koeman – who has been out of work since leaving his post at Feyenoord at the end of last season – returns from holiday on Monday and is likely to be joined at St Mary’s by his older brother Erwin as his assistant, with Jan Kluitenburg also joining as fitness coach.

“It’s correct that there are talks,” Kees Ploegsma, agent to Erwin, told the Dutch newspaper Voetbal International. “They want Ronald to be manager and his brother Erwin as his assistant.”

Ronald’s representative, Guido Albers, added: “He wants to make a next step in his career at an ambitious club with possibilities. Southampton fits in that profile. Pochettino made a solid base and Ronald is the ideal candidate to build the squad from there.”

After Pochettino joined Tottenham last month Koeman was identified as the leading candidate by Southampton’s technical director, Les Reed, and chairman, Ralph Krueger, at an early stage due to his experience of bringing through youth team products in his three seasons at Feyenoord. The former Barcelona defender was forced to blood several young players including Stefan de Vrij, Leroy Fer, Bruno Martins Indi and Jordy Clasie after the Rotterdam-based club ran into serious financial difficulties, guiding them to the qualifying rounds of next season’s Champions League in his final campaign.

His first assignment at St Mary’s will be to resolve the futures of several first-team players, with the England squad members Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw subject to bids from Liverpool and Manchester United respectively.

Having picked up 75 caps for his country as a player and two European Cups with PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, Koeman has enjoyed mixed success since starting his managerial career as an assistant to Guus Hiddink at the 1998 World Cup in France.

After winning the Eredivisie title twice with Ajax, he guided Benfica and Valencia to domestic cup success before succeeding Louis van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar in 2009, where he was sacked having won only seven times in his first 16 games in charge.",Southampton set to name Ronald Koeman as manager,http://www.theguardian.com,[Ed Aarons],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402862727365/Ronald-Koeman-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=254c13dc0bda5b6ad4fc86950705d2c7,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/southampton-new-manager-ronald-koeman
817,"Cesc Fábregas and Xabi Alonso insisted that Spain can still reach the knockout phase of the World Cup but differed in their analysis of how they must do so. “This group of players cannot be given up for dead until the very end,” Fábregas said from the national team’s training camp outside Curitiba. Alonso, meanwhile, added: “We think that we have earned the right to believe in ourselves.”

Six years of unprecedented success mean that no one could deny them that, as does the fact that they lost the first game at the last World Cup too. But Spain are conscious of the fact that the task facing them is a big one, bigger than it was then. Fábregas put it bluntly: “It is life or death, win or win. Beating Chile is our only hope: we have to win. If we don’t, we will be going home.”

Spain have two group games left, against Chile on Wednesday and against Australia on 23 June, and they must win both to have any chance of making it through to the knockout stages. Even that may not be enough however – depending on other results their fate might not be entirely in their own hands.

“We all have to treat this as a last-32 knockout game already.” Alonso said. “We are analysing it. Bit by bit we’re thinking about what we have to correct, and we trust in the team, in this group. On Wednesday we have the perfect opportunity to turn the pessimistic atmosphere around. We believe we can. If we improve, if we play well and if we don’t make mistakes, we think we still have a good chance. I think the criticism is exaggerated. I don’t think you can conclude that this generation is finished. We’re still alive and we have a chance to show that we still have something to say.

But if the two Spanish midfielders coincided in their belief that they can defeat Chile, there was a hint that the way Spain will approach the game is not yet clear when they offered up alternate visions of how to go about winning the match.

Alonso dismissed the idea that Spain’s problem had been a physical one and said that they had lost control of the game against Holland, not least in playing “more with our hearts than our heads” in the second half. He insisted that re-establishing control was fundamental and that, although they may need goals, Spain should not fall into the trap of chasing the game. “We will have to attack but there is a time for that,” he said.

Fábregas, by contrast, suggested that Spain should be more incisive and more attacking. “At the last World Cup when we were beating Chile 2-1, we had to make sure that we kept the ball in the last half an hour. This time, it will be a bit different. We have to beat Chile and if possible with more goals. It’s similar and we have to have the same attitude, faith, and effort. But instead of controlled football, of pass, pass, we perhaps have to be a bit more dynamic, a bit more vertical.

“There is not only one way of playing football. We have played a game of touch, position and control but there are moments in life, and this is one of them, when you have to attack. We have to be brave. We have to try to win by more than one goal and we have to attack, attack, and score a lot of goals.”

The back-up goalkeeper David de Gea, meanwhile, has a leg injury and could be sidelined for up to 10 days meaning he would miss the rest of the group stage. The Manchester United No1 underwent scans on Sunday that revealed a muscle strain, with the defending champions listing him as day-to-day.

819,"Every moment must be cherished when the end of a glorious career beckons but this sensational finale would have brought Ottmar Hitzfeld on to the pitch whether he was starting out at Zug or signing off with Switzerland at a World Cup. Ecuador could have won with seconds remaining. Switzerland did so with the final kick. Hitzfeld will need the extended break to recover.

Ecuador’s players were on their knees as the Switzerland team, substitutes and coaching staff cavorted all around them following Haris Seferovic’s 93rd-minute winner in Brasília. No wonder. In the final passage of play the Ecuador captain, Antonio Valencia, escaped down the right and centred to the unmarked Michael Arroyo on the penalty spot. Oh Arroyo. Glory lay at his feet but now responsibility pounds on his shoulders. He hesitated, Valon Behrami executed a vital tackle, rode a foul and instigated a counterattack that ended with Ricardo Rodríguez crossing low from the left for Seferovic to convert into the roof of the net.

The magnificent Estádio Nacional was stunned. Thousands had missed kick-off due to security checks but were compensated by a finale unlikely to be bettered in the six matches to follow here.

Fifa was probably relieved, too. This would have been a tale of Swiss injustice after Josip Drmic had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside but the focus switched from poor officialdom to the sight of Hitzfeld skipping on to the pitch in an instant. Two substitutes, Seferovic and Admir Mehmedi, scored shortly after their introductions and Switzerland’s vast second-half improvement also illustrated the prowess of the coach who delivered the Champions League to Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.

“That’s why I really enjoyed the moment,” said Hitzfeld when asked of his impending retirement. “It was a dream to win the match in the final minute like this. It created a lot of emotion and it will give us a lot of impetus for the next two matches. They were great scenes.

“Behrami did really well. He was fouled and went to the ground but saw there was an opportunity for a counter-strike and took it. It is very important to have that intuition. We knew Ecuador were still in offensive mode and we took full advantage.”

It was initially advantage Ecuador as the South Americans capitalised on a nervous and predictable opening from Hitzfeld’s team. Switzerland controlled possession in the first half but too many players appeared content to coast when, with a little more aggression and less complacency, an Ecuador defence hardly renowned for solidity would have been exposed earlier.

That criticism did not apply to the Swiss captain, Gökhan Inler, or the Bayern Munich winger and Liverpool transfer target Xherdan Shaqiri, who drove their team forward and searched for openings at every opportunity, though the latter’s deliveries were over-hit several times. Twice in quick succession he crossed over a crowded penalty area and out of play, prompting Switzerland’s coach to kick the ground in frustration before urging improvement. In the second half Shaqiri was shifted from the right to the centre, Rodríguez took over set-piece duties and with greater urgency the recovery was marked.

Shaqiri said: “You could see at the beginning we had trouble getting into our stride. It was not like us, we have tournament experience but we changed completely in the second half. We started to make easier passes and everyone gave that little bit extra.”

Switzerland’s careless start cost them when a combination of dead-ball excellence and slack defending enabled Ecuador to open the scoring. Walter Ayoví whipped in an inviting free-kick from the left that Enner Valencia steered beyond Diego Benaglio with a textbook header. Inler had lost his man as the free-kick sailed over and Johan Djourou did not react in the centre, allowing the same combination that punished England in Miami to enable Valencia to score in his fifth successive international appearance. He has accepted the difficult task of succeeding the late Christian “Chucho” Benítez impressively.

Switzerland had to react and, having replaced the anonymous Valentin Stocker at the interval, Mehmedi brought his team level with almost his first touch. Poor defending at a set piece was again the cause, although that is being kind to Ecuador. Their defending was woeful as Rodríguez swept over a corner from the left. Three blue shirts were present at the near post but Mehmedi’s marker, Carlos Gruezo, did not bother to move and the substitute converted a simple header.

Ecuador had chances to regain the lead against the unconvincing Swiss goalkeeper, though he reacted well to a deflected free-kick from the substitute Arroyo late on, but Hitzfeld’s side were denied a legitimate second when Drmic was wrongly given offside after Shaqiri had dummied Rodríguez’s cross into the area. The controversy was lost amid the drama, however. The World Cup was not ready for a stalemate.",World Cup Group E match report,http://www.theguardian.com,[Andy Hunter],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402854451558/Ecuador-v-Switzerland-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=f864c40e9db6e0931036fe6f1acfec1f,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/switzerland-ecuador-world-cup-2014-group-e-match-report
821,"José Mourinho has confirmed that Thibaut Courtois will return to Chelsea for pre-season, following his two-year loan spell at Atlético Madrid.

“When the World Cup in Brazil is over, Courtois will be coming straight back to Stamford Bridge – end of story,” the Portuguese told Marca.

The Belgian has yet to play for Chelsea competitively after his move from Genk in 2011 and has been on loan at Atlético Madrid for the past three seasons, with his performances in the last campaign integral in helping Atlético to the La Liga title and to the Champions League final. He is now widely regarded as the world’s most accomplished young goalkeeper.

Currently with the Belgian World Cup squad as they prepare for their opening game against Algeria on Tuesday, the 22-year-old revealed earlier this week that he would only be happy to return to Chelsea if he was Mourinho’s No1 choice. “Do I want to be No1 wherever I play next season? Yes, I think with my age and the performances I had I want to play. To be on the bench is not the nicest thing.”

Chelsea’s decision to recall Courtois puts real doubt over the future of Petr Cech, who has largely been unchallenged for Chelsea’s jersey since his arrival at the club in 2004. As he is just 32 years of age, there would be no shortage of suitors for his signature.

Mourinho also mentioned that he has “total confidence” in bringing Diego Costa to Chelsea. “Costa is a player who I want to have in my team,” he said. “I’ve asked my club for him and I have total confidence that we’re going to achieve it and he will end up signing for Chelsea.”

Chelsea have already started their summer rebuilding after failing to win a trophy last season, with the club this week announcing the signing of Cesc Fábregas from Barcelona.

Several first-team players are also set to leave the club this summer, but Mourinho insists midfielder Ramires will not be one of them. Reports in Spain suggest Real Madrid’s former Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti is keen on taking the Brazil international – who the Italian signed from Benfica in 2010 when he was in charge at Stamford Bridge – to the Bernabéu this summer.

However, Mourinho is adamant the 27-year-old is not going anywhere, saying: “Ramires is staying at Chelsea, he’s not for sale. I have a great relationship with important people at Real Madrid and they know that Ramires is going to stay at Chelsea.”

The Portuguese, who left Madrid last summer to return to Chelsea, also rubbished speculation he was looking to raid the European champions for any of their players. “They (Real Madrid) know that Ramires isn’t going, but they also know that I’m not interested in any Real Madrid player,” Mourinho added. (Raphaël) Varane and (Sami) Khedira? I repeat that I’m not interested in any Madrid player, full stop.”",José Mourinho: Thibaut Courtois will return to Chelsea this summer,http://www.theguardian.com,[Guardian Staff],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402838570032/Thibaut-Courtois--010.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d8464ab523feed941894ebc51ffe67a3,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-returning-atletico-madrid
823,"Wayne Rooney has admitted his place in England’s starting lineup is far from guaranteed as Roy Hodgson’s side contemplate a “do or die” game against Uruguay on Thursday to maintain their participation in the World Cup.

There were flashes of encouragement even in defeat by Italy in Manaus on Saturday, with Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck excelling, though Rooney’s display, initially from a position out wide, was relatively peripheral. The Manchester United striker set up Sturridge’s equaliser against the Azzurri but, denied a central role on his 93rd cap until the latter stages, struggled to deliver a prolonged threat.

Hodgson has pointed to the experience offered by Rooney and the captain, Steven Gerrard, as key to helping guide a relatively young side through this tournament but, when asked if he thought his place in the team was still guaranteed for the game with Uruguay on Thursday, the 28-year-old forward offered only brutal realism.

“I’ve never felt that,” said Rooney. “I don’t know why you’d say that. Why would I feel my place in the team is guaranteed? I work hard to try and get into that team and I’ve never said my place is guaranteed. I don’t expect to play. I work hard and I want to play. It’s good the manager has so many options. We have a lot of good, young players so we will all work hard, all give the manager different options, different choices and whoever he picks, then I am sure we will all respect that.”

The striker was England’s leading scorer in qualification with seven goals in six appearances but had only two touches inside the Italian penalty area in Manaus, dragging an attempt from his clearest glimpse of goal wide of the near post and failing to hit the target with the shots he conjured from outside the box. The management may consider moving him inside in São Paulo, switching Sterling back to the flank – though there is always a fluidity in terms of the attacking trio’s movement behind the lone forward, Sturridge – as they seek to revive their challenge against the South Americans.

Yet the decision to start Rooney on the left has prompted criticism in some quarters. His former United team-mate Paul Scholes joined Rio Ferdinand, who had made his views known as a pundit on television, by suggesting England should pick their squad’s 39-goal leading scorer in his natural position. “If you think about the contenders at the World Cup and goalscorers, Holland play Robin van Persie in his best position, Brazil play Neymar where he wants to play, Argentina with Messi, Portugal with Ronaldo,” Scholes told Paddy Power. “Wayne’s without doubt England’s best goalscorer but he was played on the left, played on the right, then in the centre.”

Those sentiments were echoed by José Mourinho, who admitted the role on the left was “not the best position for Wayne”. “But many, many times players must do sacrifices for their team and I think Wayne did well,” he told Yahoo. “Somebody had to play on the side, and Wayne did his job. An assist for the goal. A good participation in the game. He loses a little bit of his danger because he is naturally a goalscorer when he plays in more central positions.”

England arrived back at their Urca training base in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday to start preparations for the fixture against the Uruguayans, who lost their opening fixture in the section 3-1 to Costa Rica but hope to have Luis Suárez fit and available to start from now on in. There is an acceptance within Hodgson’s squad that they may have to beat the South Americans if they are to progress into the knockout phase – “I think it will be do or die,” said Rooney – and the management are confident Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be available to play some part if required in the fixture in São Paulo after medial ligament damage.

The squad clung to the positives from their attacking display as reason for optimism going into Thursday’s second game. “Listen, it’s a defeat,” said Gerrard. “I understand if the supporters are disappointed with a loss. The players are as well. But there are two games left and we are more than capable of getting six points and coming out of this group. I think the fans will be really pleased with large chunks of that game in Manaus. I certainly am, as captain of the team. Now we dust ourselves down and move forward. We’re certainly down at the moment but we’re not out.

“When you are captain of England there’s huge responsibility on you. I know this team will be judged on results and the outcome of this group, but big players and big leaders come back after these results like this and that’s the important thing now. To respond.

825,"It was a winning start for Argentina but their victory was not convincing even before a late Bosnia reply from Vedad Ibisevic. This was a scratchy, scrappy performance that raised far more questions than it answered against a disciplined and technically adept Bosnia side who were undone first by a moment of misfortune three minutes in to their first World Cup and then, as they tired in the second half, by a moment of brilliance from Lionel Messi.

As expected, Argentina switched to a 5-3-2 from the 4-3-3 they used for much of qualifying, with Gonzalo Higuaín being replaced by Hugo Campagnaro. Higuaín was not fully fit which, with Rodrigo Palacio out with a calf injury, perhaps in part explained why Alejandro Sabella had made the change. But it still seemed baffling, particularly given that Bosnia, having used a 4-4-2 through most of qualifying, had spent their warm-up games preparing to use the 4-2-3-1 they did ultimately deploy. Sabella was a devotee of 5-3-2 when he led Estudiantes to the title and the Copa Libertadores but the danger of using three central defenders against a lone centre-forward is that, with two spare men, one is left redundant. Sabella had only heightened the sense of mystery by saying his selection was not to do with how he expected Bosnia to line up but “more with other things, but I can’t say what publicly”, prompting rumours about cliques and splits in the squad.

Thoughts of unease, though, were swiftly banished by an incident that had little to do with tactics. Messi floated in a free-kick from the left, Marcos Rojo flicked it on and the ball cannoned in off the unfortunate Sead Kolasinac. Before this tournament, the last Bosnian to kick a ball at a World Cup had been Faruk Hadzibegic, playing for Yugoslavia, who missed a decisive penalty in the shoot-out – against Argentina – at the end of the 1990 quarter-final. Given everything Bosnia has been through in the 24 years since, it seemed desperately cruel that the next decisive intervention, just three minutes into their World Cup debut as an independent nation, should be an own-goal.

Thereafter, though, the game settled into the shape the formations suggested it might, a pattern familiar to anybody who saw much of Sabella’s Estudiantes, with Bosnia controlling possession but struggling to find gaps in a packed Argentinian rearguard. When a chance did come, it was with a ball over the top from Zvjezdan Misimovic to Miralem Pjanic that Sergio Romero was only just off his line quickly enough to smother. Even that took a finely weighted pass and an awkward stretching first touch from two very fine technicians.

Argentina were solid rather than spectacular, which is Sabella’s way, but it still felt rather anti-climactic given both the potential of their forward line and the narrative of the tournament so far. Messi had the sort of game he has had a lot recently. It would be wrong to say he was peripheral in the first half, for Messi is never peripheral, his every touch shimmering with menace, but he certainly was not as dominant as he can be at his best, the attentions of Muhamed Besic forcing him to drop deep, which left Sergio Agüero at times rather isolated.

The 21-year-old Besic, who in 2010 replaced Pjanic as the youngest player to represent Bosnia, had a fine game, both screening his defence and distributing sensibly. He often played the short pass to Pjanic, but occasionally looking long to Senad Lulic on the left flank. He was offloaded by Hamburg to Ferencvaros in 2012 after an incident that led to the manager Thorsten Fink grabbing him by the throat. The suggestion is that he has tamed the more turbulent part of his personality since then and certainly his performance was one of impressive maturity.

After going behind, Bosnia had the better of it for an hour but as Misimovic’s legs went, so did their threat. There was one long-range Javier Mascherano shot that was beaten away by Asmir Begovic but that aside, the threat came from Bosnia. Much of it came in a general sense that they might be about to create something rather than anything more tangible – credit, perhaps, to the solidity of Argentina’s defending – but Senad Lulic forced a fine save form Romero with a low header from a right-wing corner four minutes before the break.

Sabella was worried enough to make two changes at half-time, Higuaín and Fernando Gago coming on for Campagnaro and Maxi Rodríguez as he reverted to 4-3-3. Still there was little fluidity. When Messi whipped a free-kick over 20 minutes into the second half, the largelyArgentinian crowd booed. A minute later, though, he scored, cutting in-field on to his left foot and firing a shot in off the post from the edge of the box for his second World Cup goal – eight years less a day after his first. It was needed, with the substitute Vedad Ibisevic squeezing a shot through Romero with five minutes remaining to cause Argentina late anxiety.

Both Messi and Argentina will have to be far sharper if they are to return to the Maracanã in four weeks for the final.

Juventus, having caught wind of Wolfsburg’s ploy, have offered €18m plus a carrot cannily fashioned to resemble the Champions League. Wenger, so far, has done nothing towards Morata with either cash or vegetable.

It means he has left the business of negotiating his arrival as the new Southampton manager to his Mr 15%, who has been very busy on his behalf. If his Mr 15% is to be believed, Koeman will roll up at St Mary’s imminently alongside his brother Erwin, fitness coach Jan Kluitenburg and a gift set of Turkish tea glasses bought from the Ataturk airport shop.

He will hope to have someone else tucked under his arm too – namely the £8m defender Virgil van Dijk, whose form at the back for Celtic and skill with dactylic hexameter verse he hopes will fill the hole left by birthday-suit-swimmer Dejan Lovren, who wants to take his bare buttocks to Liverpool.

829,"The Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuaín admits it would be a pleasure to play alongside his fellow Argentinian Lionel Messi at Barcelona amid continued speculation the Catalan giants are looking to take him to the Camp Nou. Higuaín only joined Italian side Napoli from Real Madrid 12 months ago but Barça are reportedly keen to take the 26-year-old back to Spain as they look to rebuild under new coach Luis Enrique.

Napoli released a statement on Sunday dismissing those reports as “totally groundless”, but comments from Higuaín since have once again fuelled speculation about a possible switch.

831,"Sheffield Wednesday football club took ""two to three years"" to buy a standard first aid box, costing £25, for the first aid room at its Hillsborough ground, despite repeated requests from St John Ambulance in the period before 96 Liverpool supporters were killed there at an FA Cup semi-final in 1989.

A jury of seven women and four men at the new inquest into the disaster heard that the club finally bought the basic equipment for St John Ambulance in 1988.

At the time, St John Ambulance required £35 – less than the price of six tickets – to cover its expenses in sending volunteers to give first aid to supporters at Hillsborough matches, where the capacity was 50,000.

Fiona Barton QC, representing South Yorkshire police, said St John Ambulance ""attended without payment for a number of years"", and when the club did begin paying £600 per season to cover the costs, instead of making a donation above the required sum, it chose to give each of the volunteers a free meat pie at a match.

Questioning Graham Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday's safety officer for Hillsborough from 1986 to 1999, Barton argued that the club had been ""extremely tight"" about spending its own money, rather than grants, on safety.

Regarding the St John Ambulance funding, she asked: ""Does that not say something about the priority given to safety by the club?""

""No,"" Mackrell replied. He referred to figures from the Football Grounds Improvement Trust, which showed Sheffield Wednesday had received the second highest figure in grants for groundwork relating to safety of all Football League clubs.

Nick Brown, representing 74 families whose relatives were killed by crushing in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace at Hillsborough, accused Mackrell of failing to ensure the pens were safe, because no capacity had been calculated for each one.

Brown argued that without having calculated capacities, and without turnstiles dedicated to each pen so that the correct number of fans could be counted in, the club needed to have a system to prevent too many supporters being allowed in and the pens becoming dangerously overcrowded. Yet there was no written, agreed system for counting in supporters and monitoring overcrowding.

""If you had engaged brain about it, the system was deeply flawed, wasn't it?"" Brown asked.

""In hindsight I believe you are right,"" Mackrell replied.

Brown challenged Mackrell that he had never done anything proactive with regard to safety during his time as the club's secretary and safety officer. ""Is it correct you were completely asleep safety-wise?"" Brown asked.

""No, that's not true,"" Mackrell replied. ""I had a very close liaison with the police on a regular basis before matches.""

Mackrell acknowledged that by law and the safety regime in force, the club itself was responsible for spectators' safety and for complying with the legally required safety certificate.

He said he deferred to the technical expertise of the club's consultant engineers, Eastwood & Partners, on issues such as whether the overall stated capacity of 10,100 for the Leppings Lane terrace was correct, despite it taking no account of work done after 1979 to reduce available space.

Mackrell also said that providing annual ground safety inspection reports to the local authority after 1987, which the club failed to do, was something for which he relied on Eastwoods.

Responding to questions from Pete Weatherby QC, representing 22 families whose relatives died at Hillsborough, about the decision to close side turnstiles in 1989, meaning 10,100 Liverpool supporters had to enter through just seven turnstiles, Mackrell said that was a police decision.

Asked whether signs in the Leppings Lane terrace to tell supporters where to go were ""manifestly inadequate"", Mackrell said it was a system inherited when he joined the club, although he had discussed the signage with Eastwood.

""You are quick to point the finger at Dr Eastwood, aren't you?"" Weatherby asked him.

""No, not at all, "" Mackrell said, ""only in relation to areas of his responsibility, and the process that was in place when joining the club.""

Weatherby asked Mackrell: ""Was there anything you did or failed to do that contributed to this disaster?""

""In hindsight I relied upon other people,"" Mackrell said.

""Pointing the finger again?"" Weatherby asked.

""Not at all,"" he replied.

Mackrell said that when he joined Sheffield Wednesday in 1986 he had had no handover from the previous secretary, Richard Chester, no discussion with directors or the chairman, Bert McGee, about the role expected of him at the club, and was issued with no job description.

He said nobody at the club told him about a previous crushing incident on the Leppings Lane terrace at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final, in which Tottenham Hotspur supporters were injured, nor about the subsequent building of radial fences up the terrace to divide it into pens.

Mackrell said he had not looked at the club's safety certificate until approximately two months after he took over as the club's safety officer. ""I had a copy of it,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say I studied it intimately every day, but I had a copy of it.""

833,"Argentina’s Lionel Messi was hailed as one of the best players of all time by his coach – whatever happens at the World Cup – after scoring a classic goal to see off Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Messi’s trademark run and strike will go down as one of the great World Cup goals even though it was only his second World Cup goal, eight years after his first. Yet the Argentina captain admitted he was just relieved the team had secured a 2-1 win at the Maracanã after a disappointing first half.

Argentina had taken a lead in the third minute with a touch of fortune, Sead Kolasinac deflecting the ball into his own net, before Messi scored a stunning second after a superb run to make it 2-0.

A substitute, Vedad Ibisevic, grabbed a late goal for Bosnia – which could yet prove important in terms of qualification from Group F.

Messi said: “It’s important that we started off on the right foot with the three points, but we do have things we must improve. It’s not easy with all the anxiety and the nerves, but the important thing is the result. We had a great second half. We had the ball much more, created several opportunities and that’s what we have to continue to do.”

Argentina’s coach Alejandro Sabella only awarded his team a mark of six out 10 and said his half-time changes to provide more support to Messi had been crucial.

Sabella said: “On balance I would give it a six. We need to improve and part of that is in my hands – it is up to me.

“The changes at half-time just produced this improvement. They were playing better together and there was more support around Messi. Once Messi received the ball there was better follow-up and better support.

“I think that, whatever happens in this World Cup, he is among the best players in the history of football.”

Messi himself acknowledged the changes from five in defence to a 4-3-3 formation made it much easier for him and his fellow striker Sergio Agüero.

He said: “As strikers we prefer that system as it gives us more attacking opportunities and if we don’t use that system we suffer a bit. I was often on my own and so was Kun [Agüero] and it was very difficult, so there are things to be improved on.”

Sabella confirmed that he had taken Agüero off as he had seemed tired rather than for injury reasons, even though the Manchester City man had appeared to be limping.

Bosnia’s coach Safet Susic was satisfied with his team’s performance in a match which he said had been settled by one of the best players of all time.

Susic said: “We are realistic people and our goal was to put as much resistance as possible to one of the favourites to win the title, and this is what we have done.

“I am satisfied with what I saw, especially after we had this misfortune to concede an own goal in the first couple of minutes.

835,"In an unprepossessing industrial suburb, about a 45-minute drive out of São Paulo, is where football fans will find Willy Wonka’s factory. Like many buildings in the main city, it does not look like much from the outside – in fact, it looks disarmingly small – but this may well be a ruse to put off the less myopically devoted because inside is a veritable mecca for football (and sticker) fans. For this, you see, is Panini HQ.

Shelves of Panini-published comic books line the reception (including a rather charming series based on the adventures of Neymar, and the Brazilian footballer’s hair does make a lot more sense in comic-book form). But let’s be honest, most people are here for the stickers, and the peeks into boxes going in and out of the warehouse, stuffed with sheathes of team photos, are nigh on torture for the dedicated collector who is still missing those final dozen elusive stickers and the World Cup has already started. And shinies! There’s a whole box of shiny stickers just by that machine and …

But before we come over all Augustus Gloop and start stuffing our pockets with that final player from Russia and that sodding goalkeeper from the Korea Republic, let’s try to act like adults – and adults do make up, Panini estimates, at least half their customer base these days (and at least three-quarters of those adults, by my estimate, lie to the newsagent and say they’re buying stickers for their children). So let’s first make vaguely professional small talk with Mr Panini himself, José Eduardo Martins, its delightfully smooth-talking chief executive in Brazil.

“Although I’m a little hoarse today as I was cheering so much last night at the football!” chortles the ol’ (slightly husky) smoothy. Martins had, like the football fan he is, been at the opening game the night before and his respect for stickers is as wholehearted as that of any devotee. When he talks about the excitement of “buying a pack, and thinking: ‘Oh! Maybe the one I need will be in here!’”, his eyes pop. When friends ask him for the occasional sticker freebie, he is quite rightly indignant: “When Volkswagen releases a new model no one asks people who work there for a free car.”

Panini is, as the name suggests, an Italian company, but it has had a factory near São Paulo since 1989, which provides stickers to all of South America and Latin America, while the one in Modena, Italy, attends to everyone else’s sticker needs. The World Cup is the company’s bonanza time, with sales increasing by what Martins modestly estimates as 50%. The publication of the World Cup albums, with their 640 squares waiting to be filled with the faces of every football player, plus those all important shinies, is rightly described by Martins as “the real launch of the World Cup”.

Sales are up this World Cup in nearly all the 100 countries in which the stickers are sold, but Brazil is by far the largest consumer, with twice as many sticker sales as Germany, its only real competitor in the sticker aficionado stakes. A lot of this, of course, is to do with the World Cup happening in Brazil: Panini sticker collecting has become a sign of patriotism, with even Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, claiming that she winds down after a hard day of international politics by swapping stickers with her three-year-old grandson. But it has also become a form of Brazilian socialising: huge meets are organised on social media so fans can swap stickers in malls and other public spaces. “My theory is that it’s because of the internet. You have 1,000 friends on Facebook, but how many do you see every day? You don’t have 1,000 friends, you just maybe communicate with 1,000 people,” says Martins, telling it like it is. “I think people like to meet, and this is an opportunity.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Collecting sheets of the new stickers. Photograph: Tom Jenkins

Although Panini doesn’t release sales figures due to a confidentiality agreement with Fifa, Martins can say that since February, the small factory in São Paulo has printed nine million stickers a day on its 21 machines – the one in Modena, which is bigger, has been printing over 11 million a day – and the staff on the factory floor have been working round the clock to meet the demand.

Over 65 million Panini sticker albums have been published for this World Cup. “What other publishing company prints 65 million copies of anything?” he says. “Except the Bible, maybe. We are the Bible!” News stories reflecting South America’s biblical love for Panini stickers became as common in the runup to the World Cup as anguished sports pieces about the fitness of various players: there was the heist of 300,000 stickers in Rio (“Something always happens in Rio!” laughs Martins), and the tale of the teacher in Colombia who was caught stealing stickers from his own students. One misguided soul tried to sue Panini for £50,000, claiming that his son had suffered “depression and illness” after failing to receive a sticker he ordered. “That was a nuisance,” tuts Martins.

But Panini takes its relationship with customers very seriously, and Martins says: “If customers tell us they want us to make scratch and sniff stickers, we listen.” So far, no one has requested a scratch and sniff Wayne Rooney. To prove his devotion to his public, Martins listens solemnly to conspiracy theories about collecting, and he replies to them with surprising candour.

He reveals that, just as Panini collectors have long suspected, “yes you can” improve your chances of finishing your collection if you buy stickers from different vendors because of the way the stickers are distributed. He pooh-poohs the rumour that they deliberately restrict the number of a team’s stickers in that team’s country as a sales tactic (“Ha ha! No.”). Does Panini get annoyed when their team lineups turn out to be – how to put this delicately – wrong? Ashley Cole, for one, is in the England lineup in the album.

“I say, our teams aren’t wrong, they’re different. Back in 2010 we selected Ronaldinho and the coach chose Kaká, who was injured and we were eliminated – so who was really wrong?”

And finally, what the hell has happened to the England team? Not on the pitch – in the stickers. Whereas all the other teams are pictured in their kit, the England players appear be Photoshopped into plain white T-shirts. Worse, instead of having a proper team photo, they are instead a weird collection of floating heads.

“Hahaha! It’s annoying, no?” he laughs.

Yes, it is. The reason, English fans may not be surprised to learn, is the FA. They may be more surprised to learn that it is also due to Robert Maxwell. Up until 1988, Panini UK had an agreement with the FA and was allowed to use images. But then Maxwell bought Panini and the directors of Panini UK broke away: “You’re from the UK so you understand: Maxwell did not have a very good reputation there, right?” smiles Martins. These directorsThey formed their own company, Merlin, and took the rights with them. Merlin was then taken over by Topps and the result is that England are the only World Cup team that Panini can’t reproduce with logos or emblems, which is why the players all look like they’re wearing bibs in the photos.

“We have made offers for Topps, though not directly – we definitely want [the rights from the FA.] Topps stickers are not the same quality as ours,” he shrugs.

Downstairs in the factory, it is almost impossible to believe that nine million stickers are processed and packaged every day. The factory floor is about the size of a small school auditorium and, while the cutting and mixing machines make an impressive amount of noise, the most striking thing about it is how manual it is: the machines are all fed by hand and over 70 workers walk calmly around with giant sheets of players’ images before slicing them, mixing them and packaging them. Even more amazing is the request room, where inquiries for specific stickers come in. The factory currently receives over 8,000 requests a day and these are filled by a handful of women diligently fetching stickers out of cubbyholes and then filling envelopes. “Women are more attentive than men. They are better at detail. It’s true!” Martins grins.

So come on, José. If we can’t, in all good conscience, ask for our missing stickers, tell us at least the secret to completing a Panini sticker album before the World Cup.

The club appointed the Everton academy chief Alan Irvine as Pepe Mel’s successor on Saturday but Sherwood, who was sacked by Spurs after a six-month spell, said he was initially offered the job.

“I went to speak to the chairman and the board there a couple of times and was happy with how the discussions were going,” he told TalkSport. “I was offered the job before we started to negotiate. It just wasn’t right for me in the end, so I decided to give it a miss.

“It is a fantastic club and it looked on the outside like it might be a perfect fit for me but unfortunately we couldn’t agree for me to move forward. I wish them all the best and Alan in particular, someone I played with a long time ago at Blackburn.”

Irvine accepted the job at The Hawthorns after agreeing to keep on the coaches Keith Downing and Dean Kiely, and Sherwood suggested that was one of the reasons he did not take up the offer.

“I don’t know Keith or Dean very well and I’ve got nothing against them,” he said. “I think it is important you take your own men in and I was looking to bring in a couple of guys who I trust and who I know. When you go into a club you haven’t got time to try and train someone to your own thinking. There were just a couple of ingredients missing which made me decide I wouldn’t take the gamble on it. I know my worth and I just want to wait for the right opportunity. I am sure it will come along.”

The 45-year-old, however, is sure he will be back managing in the Premier League again before long as he looks to prove a point after his brief spell at Spurs. “I am confident in my ability to be able to do the job,” he added.",Tim Sherwood says he turned down West Brom over club’s staff demands,http://www.theguardian.com,[Press Association],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402916773259/Tim-Sherwood-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=7e892c696e14b03a598fdde08219441b,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/tim-sherwood-west-brom-staff-demands

In non-World Cup news, Ronald Koeman has been named Southampton's new manager. The Dutch are coming!

“I am thrilled to be the manager of Southampton Football Club,"" he said. ""From my very first meeting with Les Reed, I could see clearly that this was the right club for me. We share the same philosophy of football, and the same belief in how to develop the club.



“Southampton have a talented first-team squad, a world-class academy and the infrastructure to sustain success in the Premier League.



“The opportunity to continue the development of this famous football club was simply too good to turn down. I cannot wait to get started.”

Les Reed had this to say: “We are extremely pleased to have secured a new manager of Ronald Koeman’s calibre and status within the game. In appointing Ronald we have concluded our search for a manager who shares our values and vision for the future of Southampton Football Club.

“As part of our ongoing scouting process, we have been following the development of Ronald’s coaching career for some time and, through a more formal process this month, immediately identified him as our number-one choice.



“From the moment we met with Ronald, it was clear he had the vision and ambition to take our club forward, that he shared our football philosophy and could see the opportunity to move our club to the next level.



“The club, the players and the fans will all be excited to have a man of Ronald’s experience at the very highest level joining our club. Ronald’s passion for the opportunity here at St Mary’s was very clear, and we look forward to continuing our growth with him as part of our team.”",World Cup 2014: day five – live!,http://www.theguardian.com,"[Simon Burnton, Jacob Steinberg, Scott Heinrich, Barry Glendenning, Tom Bryant]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402925002467/c2872f12-8393-4411-b3aa-64e36e89e001-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=43a0eb128c3531c718dea0da0b0bee6a,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/world-cup-2014-day-five-live
841,"Italy are hopeful that their goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the defender Mattia De Sciglio will recover in time for Friday’s Group D match against Costa Rica. Both players missed the Azzurri’s 2-1 triumph over England on Saturday with injuries. Buffon twisted his left ankle last Friday and was replaced by Salvatore Sirigu in goal.

“Gigi [Buffon] has had a specific trauma, which is not your usual sprained ankle,” Italy’s team doctor Enrico Castellacci said. “It has affected the knee but fortunately, the knee ligament is fine. His condition will be evaluated. He is having specific therapy and we will decide whether or not to do some x-rays. We will try to have him available as soon as possible.

“We are optimistic that he will have a speedy recovery but his health comes first. I cannot say if he will be able to make it for the game against Costa Rica. After the injury, Buffon told me he was relieved because for a moment he feared he may have to miss the World Cup.”

De Sciglio, meanwhile, has a calf strain. “There is no date yet for his return,” Castellacci said. “Right now he is not in a condition to train with the rest of the squad because you cannot take risks when dealing with muscular injuries. Mattia was also concerned he might miss the World Cup but once he was reassured that he could play in Brazil, he smiled again.”

Castellacci is hoping Fifa will allow time-outs for the players to drink water or fluids during the Italy’s next two games, against Costa Rica and Uruguay, both of which will kick-off at 1pm local time.

Italy and England played later and were not allowed any time-outs during Saturday’s match. But both teams admitted after the game that the heat and humidity in Manaus had affected the players.

“It would have been good to have had a three-minute time-out during that game,” Castellacci said. “Fortunately, we prepared well and none of our players had cramps.

“I hope that in Recife and Natal, where the conditions will be no better than in Manaus because of the times the games are scheduled, Fifa will reconsider. The criteria is that if the temperature is 32C or above then the time-out is almost automatic. However, what they don’t consider is that with humidity above 70 to 80%, it feels three or four degrees warmer. With those conditions and in these type of games, one can lose two litres of sweat.”",World Cup 2014: Italy expect Gianluigi Buffon to be fit for Costa Rica,http://www.theguardian.com,[Press Association],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402915660103/Gianluigi-Buffon-012.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=dac141217d98c9a9f26e273c743f36ae,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/world-cup-2014-italy-gianluigi-buffon
843,"Hugo Lloris believes that Karim Benzema will use the World Cup to showcase his talent and prove that he belongs on the biggest stage in football.

Benzema was left out of the France squad that performed so miserably in South Africa four years ago and arrived at the World Cup having not scored at a major finals, but his two goals in the 3-0 win over Honduras on Sunday night signalled a determination to make up for lost time.

Although Benzema has enjoyed his most productive season for Real Madrid, scoring 26 goals in all competitions for the Champions League winners, his place in the France team was the subject of much debate only recently.

Benzema had failed to score in 15 matches for his country, spanning 1,222 minutes of football, until he registered in a 6-0 win over Australia in October.

He has now plundered eight in his last seven games for France and, in the absence of the injured Franck Ribéry, is the most experienced player in Didier Deschamps’s squad and arguably their most influential. It was Benzema’s penalty that set France on their way against Honduras and he also had a significant hand in the second, when his left-footed shot cannoned off the upright and was turned into his own goal by the Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares. A thumping angled drive into the roof of the net rounded off an impressive night.

“He had a really good season with Real Madrid, he won the Champions League final and is in good confidence,” Lloris, the France captain, said. “He played well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to play [on Sunday]. He showed that and scored two, maybe three, depending on the Fifa decision, and it was important for him and for the team to start well because he is a decisive player for France. Maybe he is our key player and he showed it.

“When you play for Real Madrid, you have to be a special player. He is still young but he is an excellent player. He has a big talent and for him this competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone.

“This was his first game at the World Cup after being left out four years ago. You never know what will happen in the future. The World Cup only comes every four years and when you have the chance to play you have to take it and enjoy the possibility to play at your best level and do everything for the team. That’s what every player did [against Honduras].”

The victory was France’s first in the World Cup since they defeated Portugal in the semi-final in 2006 and lifted some of the gloom that has enveloped Les Bleus since the antics in South Africa in 2010, when they were eliminated at the group stage on the back of a player revolt.

This time the only off-the-field problem that France have had to contend with has concerned the drone that hovered above the team’s training base in Ribeirão Preto last week, raising concerns that they were being spied upon.

Deschamps described the device as an “intrusion into our privacy” and said that Fifa were carrying out an investigation into the incident.

“It’s a good invention,” Lloris said when asked about the drone. “It looked like a little helicopter, very small and it flew well. It’s a good object for journalists. We heard it and then we saw it. We didn’t see anyone controlling. Maybe they were behind the stand. It didn’t stay over us for a long time. There was nothing we could do to stop it – maybe kick the ball at it. But it’s a big challenge to hit it!”

Asked about Deschamps’s comments, and the idea that France’s privacy had been compromised, Lloris said: “Players can do nothing about that. We can’t have control of the drone. Maybe the guy is from the hotel just behind the stand and you can’t see him. Maybe with a good job of the security we can find him.”","World Cup 2014: Karim Benzema can be France’s star, says Hugo Lloris",http://www.theguardian.com,[Stuart James],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402923665351/Karim-Benzema-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=57a6c08f3e39f6ad36f1198359f05ca1,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/world-cup-2014-karim-benzema-france
845,"England has tomato sauce to hand while pasta is Italy's preferred fuel before matches, says their team nutritionist

Italy packed parmesan, olive oil and prosciutto; while the USA team brought oatmeal, Cheerios, peanut butter and A1 Steak Sauce. The Mexican squad, of course, required a little more spice. El Tri travelled with the ingredients for pozole, along with chilli peppers, chipotle chillies and nopales – cacti.

When it comes to World Cup food, teams won't leave anything to chance. They expect their players to have top nutrition, and also want them to enjoy some favourites so they are comfortable and at their best when it's time to play.

For the Italians, attention to culinary detail is nothing new. The Azzurri have always been particular about their pasta. ""Pasta is our preferred fuel, and before matches we play with the tricolore: pasta (white), tomato (red) and extra virgin olive oil (green),"" explained the team's nutritionist, Elisabetta Orsi, referring to the colours of Italy's flag.

With everything else taking up suitcase space, the Italians left their bottled water back home this time because of the high cost of bringing it.

For England, Roy Hodgson has lifted the ban on ketchup imposed by his predecessor as manager, Fabio Capello.

Italy and USA have put a greater emphasis on nutrition under new coaches, each carefully planning meals with the guidance and direction of a dietitian or nutritionist and a chef. For Italy, even the medical staff may offer input to team chef Claudio Silvestri, who has his own TV commercials.

Everything is planned carefully based on the climate, availability of fresh fruit and vegetables, and other conditions. Orsi said: ""Generally, the nutritionist establishes a dietary plan for the squad based on the type of training necessary match by match. The physicians are responsible for pointing out problems with individual players so the nutritionist can formulate a specific diet.""

Long before the USA team travelled to Brazil this month, chef Bryson Billapando and sports performance dietitian Danielle LaFata (left) visited the team's hotels in São Paulo, Natal, Manaus and Recife to scour the kitchens and dining spaces and assess food options.

Jürgen Klinsmann, the USA's team coach, loves a diet of fresh, organic vegetables – pesticide-free and flavoured with herbs and spices instead of fatty options such as butter and oil. Avocados are a must – the Americans go through an average of a case a day – and each meal includes two cooked vegetables featuring two colours, and players are encouraged to add more variety from fruit and the salad bar.

There is also an emphasis on hydration and LaFata makes pre-workout energy shooter drinks, then blends individually designed smoothies for each player after games. She even makes a ""spa water"" with herbs and fruit to reduce the juice intake. The 5ft LaFata She pulls around a cooler on wheels that's nearly as big as she is, filled with fresh fruit. ""They're big juice drinkers,"" she said coffee limit is three cups per day.

Even the substitutes exert themselves during warm-ups before and during matches.

Billapando said: ""The level we want to take this to, it's going to be as high as we can take it because we never know what that 1% might be that takes us to the championship.""

The teams' care with food is a wise precaution. Last month, a Brazilian consumer group said it had found food past its expiry date in the hotels where the Italy and England teams are staying.",Pass the ketchup: World Cup 2014 players dip into favourite foods,http://www.theguardian.com,"[David Hytner, Associated Press In S O Paulo, Simon Burnton, Andy Hunter, Nick Miller, Jacob Steinberg]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402924360180/Ketchup-Ramekin-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=0cc8103600a63254800e24af13d6ea8a,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/world-cup-2014-players-favourite-foods-tournament
847,"Robin van Persie has received many plaudits for his wonderful, diving, headed goal against Spain, but he has now been given a more hand-crafted honour. His goal in Holland’s 5-1 victory over Spain has been celebrated in a flipbook animation.

The goal came when Daley Blind fired a diagonal ball from the halfway line, and from out wide on the left wing. Van Persie ran from outside the penalty area to meet the ball but despite most fans expecting him to volley the ball into the net, the Dutch striker threw himself through the air and managed to lob the Spanish keeper Iker Casillas with his header. Van Persie then ran to the touchline to celebrate with the manager Louis van Gaal, who will also coach him at Manchester United next season.

“The pass from Daley Blind for Van Persie was fantastic, the finish was great,” said Van Gaal. “There was so much feeling. If you can make a goal in that way it’s great ... really fantastic.

849,"WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED

It was a bad weekend for monotonous Lancastrians everywhere as the nation’s ire turned on droning BBC microphone-botherer Phil Neville. Twelve years after Gareth Southgate complained about Sven-Goran Eriksson’s World Cup half-time team-talk, saying “we were expecting Winston Churchill and instead we got Iain Duncan-Smith”, the nation would have been perfectly happy with Iain Duncan-Smith and instead got a small and unremarkable pebble, viewed from a distance, in thick fog. As England v Italy kicked off on Saturday night, commentator Guy Mowbray turned to the man beside him. “Shall we just try to enjoy it, Phil?” he asked. “It’s always difficult. As an English supporter. To enjoy these occasions,” jawed Neville. And they were probably the truest words said all night.

The following day on ITV, Countdown-contesting PFA brainbox Clarke Carlisle glowingly informed us that Ecuador’s attack must be good if a talent as bright as Porto’s Jackson Martínez can’t even get in the team, forgetting that the team he can’t get into is Colombia’s. Despite their brilliant attack, Ecuador fell to a dramatic defeat at the hands of Switzerland, Haris Seferovic finding a way past Alexander Dominguez deep into stoppage time. Which is incredible when you think about it, because Dominguez is so good even Lev Yashin can’t get in the team. To complete a bad weekend for British television commentators [and Richard Keys – O Fiverão Ed], during France v Honduras the BBC’s Jonathan Pearce totally failed to grasp the fact that when the ball crosses the line between the posts and under the bar, it is not widely considered controversial if the referee then awards a goal.

In Uruguay it was revealed that a survey of more than 835,000 crimes committed in Montevideo over an eight-year period concluded that thefts and robberies decrease by 15% while the national team is playing important matches. The Fiver guesses that violent crime increases, with most of it being perpetrated by people actually on the pitch playing in the important matches – Maximiliano Pereira’s stoppage-time sending-off in the defeat to Costa Rica on Saturday was the nation’s ninth World Cup red card, a record bettered – or worsened, depending on how you look at it – only by Argentina (10) and Brazil (11). Filthy, filthy South Americans – the worst offenders from the rest of the world are Italy, Holland and Cameroon with seven each (angelic England have only three names on their list of shame).

Talking of discipline, on Saturday the Honduras coach, Luis Fernando Suárez, spoke about his side’s approach to the game. “We play football and follow the rules,” he said. “We have the right attitude to face our matches with personality and with hunger. We want to win, that’s what we want. But we can’t be called violent.” On Sunday, however, they could be called violent as they had one man sent off and generally flung their limbs about with wild abandon whenever a blue shirt was nearby. “We have our own style, a strong and intense style,” insisted Suárez post-match after their 3-0 defeat. If only their style were a little less strong and intense, and Neville’s a little more so, both of their weekends might have gone a little better.

“How would you feel if someone took naked pictures of you?

O FIVERÃO LETTERS

“I’m happy to try a little witchcraft on England’s behalf (O Fiverão passim). I got this from a second world war documentary I saw on the television as a child. It’s supposed to bring inanimate objects to life, so should do well for Rooney and co. Here goes, and if I recall, I need to say this with a little bit of flair – ‘Treguna Mekoides Trecorum Satis Dee’. There. That should sort things out in time for Uruguay” – Tom Cook.

“In response to Jason Tew bemoaning the quality of the foreign pundits on ITV (Friday’s O Fiverão letters), the simple fact of the matter is that punditry is all about results. TV execs are not going to throw young, unproven English pundits in at a World Cup when the stakes are so high. Rather than moan about the proliferation of foreign pundits, he needs to look at the wider issue of how we are developing our young homegrown pundits so that they can perform on the biggest stage” – Marc Sinfield.

“Stop Phil Neville. Please” – Philip Ayrton (and 1,056 others).

“Daley Blind’s cross for Robin van Persie’s goal against Spain. I guess you could say he passed the Dutch way from the left-hand side. Hello? Anyone? Is this thing on?” – Derek McGee.

“Does the USA! USA!! USA!!! fan you quoted, Quinn Gemperlin (Friday’s Bits and Bobs), actually exist?

857,"1) Sterling looked at home on the biggest stage

Every World Cup there is a young player who takes the tournament with storm – and this time it could be Raheem Sterling. His was a wonderfully exuberant performance and he looked so utterly calm, so utterly at home at the biggest stage of the world. From just the third minute he skipped past Gabriel Paletta and unleashed a shot that hit the side-netting. Even the BBC thought it was in, changing the scoreline in the top left to ENG 1-0 ITA. And that was just the beginning. He started the move for England’s equaliser with a brilliantly weighted through-ball and continued to trouble Italy’s experienced midfielders throughout the game. It was not only his technique which stood out, though. He was everywhere, one second turning Andrea Pirlo inside out and the next subjecting Marco Verratti to a crunching tackle. One second he was setting up Gerrard for an inviting chance, the next chasing back to his own half to halt a late Italy chance (for which he was booked). A complete performance and one of the best of the World Cup so far.

2) The Rooney debate will rage on

Wayne Rooney was not dropped and yet in a sense, he still was. Roy Hodgson opted for Raheem Sterling centrally and moved the Manchester United forward out to the left, where he struggled. Rooney will have been quietly furious but such is his professionalism that he worked tirelessly for the team and set up England’s goal. But the remaining impression is of a player who has lost his spark, especially on the international scene. If Arjen Robben seems to get quicker for every year (he is 30 now), that is certainly not the case with Rooney, who is two years younger at 28. He looks more lethargic every season and if he is not going to play centrally up front or as the No10, he should not be in the team. Hodgson, who said he disagreed with the notion that Rooney had looked “uncomfortable”, has a tough decision to make before the Uruguay game.

3) Prandelli is a magician

Italy did not have a good build-up, by any stretch of the imagination. Two weeks ago they lost their key midfielder Riccardo Montolivo to a broken leg. Cesare Prandelli then lost another player for the England game, the first-choice left-back Mattia De Sciglio, and finally, on the day, he was forced to deal with the absence of his captain, Gianluigi Buffon, who had suffered an ankle injury the day before.

Did he panic? Of course he did not. Prandelli said recently that he had a dream of winning the World Cup using seven different formations in seven games and if his injury problems continue then he may have to. Here, though, his team acted as if this was a first-choice selection, full of confidence and endeavour. The left-back position is not Giorgio Chiellini’s favourite but he rarely looked in trouble. On the right, the Matteo Darmian-Antonio Candreva partnership was behind many of their best chances throughout the game and was just more evidence of the Italian coach’s fantastic tactical flexibility. Darmian made his Italy debut two weeks ago.

4) England should have had a penalty

Perhaps lost in the helter-skelter nature of the game was the fact that England should have had a penalty in the second half. Italy were 2-1 up in the 56th minute when Steven Gerrard broke into the Italian penalty area and was bundled over by Paletta, the Argentinian-born defender who was once a team-mate of the England captain at Liverpool. It was not the worst challenge ever seen in a World Cup (there is always Benjamin Massing to lean back on) but it was a clear foul. Paletta, who did not have a good game, did not touch the ball but clearly shoulder-charged Gerrard. The only mystery was why Gerrard did not appeal more energetically.

5) How far will the Italian team spirit take them?

This Italian team does not have an abundance of brilliant players. Mario Balotelli? Tick. Andrea Pirlo? Tick. Gianluigi Buffon? Tick. And that’s about it. Still, the game against England showed why they can go far at this World Cup. There is a togetherness there that has not always been case in Italian teams. On the morning of the game, Mario Balotelli, tweeted to an expectant nation: “Whatever team you support, today only the blue Azzurri team matters. Leave hate, jealousy and contempt to one side and we will stay united ALL of us.”

It seemed to set the tone and the team were certainly united, and you could see at the final whistle what it mean to the players. There was hugging, there was shouting, there were high-fives and a big embrace between Georgio Chiellini and Mario Balotelli, who on the face of it could not be more different. One is a Juve player and the other a Milan player. One is a defender and the other a striker. One is a brute and the other a newly-engaged bad boy. Yet they played in harmony and celebrated in harmony. And there was even a smile from Balotelli. If he is that happy, who knows what can happen this summer.",England 1-2 Italy: Five talking points from the World Cup Group D match,http://www.theguardian.com,"[David Hytner, Marcus Christenson, Simon Burnton, Andy Hunter, Nick Miller, Jacob Steinberg]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402816416907/Raheem-Sterling-010.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=e8eb92196b58a179639030af97a07a63,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/15/england-italy-world-cup-talking-points
859,"By the time Roy Hodgson and his players had made it back to Rio de Janeiro they were a man down. The physiotherapist, Gary Lewin, had jumped up to celebrate Daniel Sturridge’s goal against Italy and landed on a water bottle, dislocating and fracturing his ankle. The assistant manager, Ray Lewington, has already had an operation, removing him from coaching duties, after an old injury flared up and his knee “locked” one night during the training camp in Miami. In Euro 2012 it was the goalkeeping coach, Ray Clemence, snapping his achilles tendon in the warm-up to the first game. With England one quickly comes to learn that, if there is a lamp-post around, there is always the risk someone will bang his head.

They passed the ball with a speed of thought and movement against Italy that had not been seen previously in Hodgson’s two years in charge but a dignified defeat is still a defeat and the England manager should not expect so much understanding and kindness if there is the same outcome against Uruguay in São Paulo on Thursday.

A World Cup comes round only every four years and public sympathy will quickly drift away if England are required to collect their jacket and are shown the door, five days after they started.

They have never been eliminated from a World Cup after losing their first two games. The odds are already stacked against them, bearing in mind 46 teams have lost their first match over the previous four tournaments and only four have made it into the knockout stages.

Yet it was a strange form of gloom boarding the plane back to Rio. England had looked like a team that wanted to reinvent itself in Manaus and Uruguay, while not being a side to underestimate, were conspicuously vulnerable in their 3-1 defeat by Costa Rica.

“They are certainly beatable,” the captain, Steven Gerrard, said. “They concede goals and, if we attack like we did against Italy, we will cause Uruguay big problems. If we play with that bravery again, we could cause any team in the world problems.”

Hodgson would not go as far as saying that he would stick with the same team but the only selection issues are whether he makes any special plans for Luis Suárez and how he lines up the three attacking players behind Sturridge.

One option would be to restore Wayne Rooney to the middle, in the hope that it helps him to click, and to move Sterling to a wider position but with a licence to roam. All that can really be said with great certainty is that Sterling’s performance in the Arena Amazônia has established him as a mandatory first-team pick. “He’s fearless,” Gerrard said. “That’s his character. He doesn’t worry about the opposition.”

Hodgson confided afterwards that he had made up his mind several months ago that Sterling could be a star of this tournament. He had deliberately downplayed it because he did not want Italy to know in advance. Uruguay will know better.

“I don’t care who’s defending against him – you cannot take the ball off him,” Jordan Henderson, another member of England’s Liverpool contingent, said. “He has shown on the world stage now just how good he is, his intelligence getting on the ball, turning and getting past players. He’s so strong and he’s just going to get better.”

What England must work on is the balance of the side and making sure this new commitment to adventure does not expose them to the point that it is self-defeating. At half-time Hodgson had expressed his concern about the frequency with which the overlapping right-back, Matteo Darmian, was ganging up with Antonio Candreva on Leighton Baines.

That, however, was always likely to be the risk when the side favours Daniel Welbeck as an advanced right-sided midfielder rather than the more defence-orientated James Milner. Five minutes into the second half Baines was left vulnerable again. “We got caught too high up the field, with Danny Welbeck,” Hodgson said.

“They slipped the ball behind us, we didn’t block the cross and [Mario]Balotelli pulled away and scored. You can’t blame the left-back purely. We didn’t defend that area well. We were playing very offensive wide-midfield players – Rooney, Welbeck and Sterling all out there – and I’m afraid we were going to get caught from time to time.”

What was really noticeable here was that Hodgson was not talking as if he was contemplating bringing back Milner or shifting back to the 4-4-2 system that accompanied his first 18 months in the job. Instead he wants more of the same, albeit with a little bit of fine-tuning. Uruguay’s record in qualifying was not hugely distinguished, finishing fifth out of nine teams before overcoming Jordan in a play-off, and Hodgson will essentially encourage his players to continue where they left off against Italy.

“Our pace is going to be a weapon for us going forward,” he said. “We just have to ally the pace with scoring goals. We have to be a bit more ruthless, like Italy were. We have to make sure we score from those chances.”

As for Suárez, England are preparing on the basis that he will be fit enough to start. Gerrard is convinced on the basis that his Liverpool team-mate “has been so quiet”, with none of the usual text dialogue. The Football Association’s media department had already instructed England’s players not to get too much into specifics when they are talking about Suárez in the next few days. Hodgson, thankfully, is allowed to operate by his own rules and it was interesting to hear him say Suárez does not deserve to be bracketed among the world’s great players. Not yet, anyway.

“I think he will be at that level only when he shows it on this stage,” he said. “If you ask me: ‘Do I think he has the potential? Is he a wonderful footballer?’ Yes, he sure is.

“But if you are really going to put him up there with Diego Maradona, Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff … you might even argue [Lionel] Messi needs this tournament to get up there with the legends of football.

“[Andrea] Pirlo is challenging that category. He has done it time and again, showing what a wonderful footballer he is, because this is the stage you have to do it on. Being a great player in your league will get you lots of plaudits but for the world to recognise one of the all-time greats you have to do it at the World Cup.”

The same could roughly be said of Rooney, albeit with slightly less conviction that he is going to do anything about it. Rooney used to excite in the way that Sterling does now, but not for a while. He can certainly play better but, in fairness to him, so can Gerrard; it just does not attract anything like the same level of exposure because the narratives surrounding the two players are very different.

They are still important players in a team that produced more good than bad, with a 91% pass-completion rate. Statistically England have never played the ball with greater accuracy in a World Cup tie as far as back as that kind of data is available, from 1966 onwards.

“We won’t panic,” Hodgson said. “We will try to cheer up the players and show them some of the things in the game that were very good. In my time with the national team I have to say that is the most positive performance I have seen from us. It gives me great hope going forward, not just for the next two games, but even further than that.” The alternative, for Hodgson, is something he will not want to think about.",England’s spirit of adventure must not put World Cup survival at risk,http://www.theguardian.com,[Daniel Taylor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402859027636/Raheem-Sterling-England-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=53a717aebd6b038b49e103294c812fc9,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/15/england-spirit-adventure-world-cup-survival-risk
861,"Wayne Rooney did try to be positive. There were aspects of Saturday’s defeat by Italy which warranted optimism in terms both of the years ahead but also, potentially, of the next week in Brazil. But his mood also bristled in the immediate aftermath of the defeat at the Arena Amazônia, most notably at the suggestion that he had once been guaranteed a place in Roy Hodgson’s starting lineup but also when the prickly issue of his position reared up.

The Manchester United forward had started the first half in Manaus on the left, began the second period on the right and spent only the latter stages attempting to unsettle through the middle. “I think it was quite clear,” he said when asked what his role had been. “I played on one side initially, then the other after half-time. It was a switch from the manager.”

But does involvement on either flank coax the best from him? “I don’t know. I enjoyed the game. I was involved in the match: I could have scored, I created the goal and felt I had an influence even though we lost.” Somewhere beneath the monotone response flickered frustration.

In truth Rooney had drifted in and out of the contest as much as he flitted from flank to flank. If Fifa’s running statistics were an indication of his industry – no England player covered more ground than his 11.1km – then they also served to illustrate how desperate he was to be involved, forever seeking out the ball as he yearned to have an impact.

This was by no means a lacklustre display, with the man around whom the team once revolved effectively transformed into a workhorse. Neither was it entirely ineffective, one freakishly sliced corner aside. Admittedly there were a few inaccurate attempts thrown in but he created those chances for himself, eking out space from Italy’s back-line. Yet the reality that he contributed only two touches in the Italian penalty area all evening told its own story. He will surely not “enjoy” this tournament, as he had pledged to do last week, if he is marooned far from goal.

The exasperation served up in some quarters at his performance appeared to be born of the fact he had failed to take this game by the scruff of the neck and dominate in the same jaw-dropping way Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben had done against the Spanish or Alexis Sánchez had against Australia. But at least that trio were playing in positions which suit them best. “The disappointing thing was not the way Wayne Rooney played but where he was played,” said Paul Scholes in his latest missive for Paddy Power. “I don’t blame Wayne one little bit but he was played in three different positions. He’s without doubt England’s best goalscorer but he was played on the left, played on the right, then in the centre. Where’s the confidence in Wayne to say: ‘You’re our main player. You’re our centre-forward?’ If he plays there, he scores goals.”

That much is undeniable. Rooney was England’s leading scorer in the qualifying campaign, with seven in six matches, and scored home and away against Poland and Montenegro, two of the more awkward opponents in the section. He has 39 goals from 93 caps, a prolific record to prove that, when utilised close to goal as he was by Fabio Capello, he has tended to thrive. That he has failed to illuminate England’s last three appearances at major finals is accepted but, in the context of his record and the threat he is known to carry, does he truly merit merely being shoehorned awkwardly into the lineup? Why would he not be played through the middle?

The simple answer is that Daniel Sturridge merits his inclusion as the lone forward, a player propelled into this tournament by the most productive Premier League campaign of his career and a youngster in whom the national team now trust. His sixth international goal was scored on the half-volley with panache, supplied by Rooney’s most telling contribution from the flank. The 24-year-old deserves a starting role – his bite and eagerness to rip shots goalwards whenever he can are refreshing – but would his more experienced team-mate not be better suited as the No10, where he can gather, turn and deliver passes to runners all around? He would certainly be likelier to make his own impression in the penalty area from that starting point.

The urgency to tap into his predatory instincts is acknowledged. “Of course, we need him to have more touches in the box,” said Roy Hodgson. “We want him in the area. But I thought he set up the goal really well with that clever pass. Then, after Leighton Baines put him in, I was convinced he was going to score when he got himself room in the box. But, yes, we want Wayne in the box and there’s no question we will get him in the box. He certainly worked his socks off for us.” His workrate is not in doubt but where Hodgson had decreed Raheem Sterling’s pace to be a means of unsettling Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi, perhaps the Liverpool teenager – such a revelation – may be better utilised more from the wing against Uruguay. That would at least offer Rooney the chance to convert rather than create opportunities.

There will still be occasions to interchange with the sprinters, to allow Sterling or Danny Welbeck to run at Diego Lugano and potentially free up space in which England’s most senior forward can thrive. That seems his likeliest route to a first World Cup goal. This is a team that still leans heavily on the handful of players in their number with experience of World Cup finals and Hodgson would not countenance leaving Rooney out for a game which has now become do or die. Once that is accepted, surely a role in the centre awaits.",England must get best out of Wayne Rooney before time runs out,http://www.theguardian.com,[Dominic Fifield],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402852541777/Wayne-Rooney-is-tracked-b-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=2ae5ec6faea71ebf34a1f2a0426b46ba,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/15/england-wayne-rooney-world-cup-roy-hodgson-uruguay
863,"The sweat dripped off Karim Benzema’s nose as he waited over the penalty spot. The delay while order was restored around him must have felt like aeons dragging in slow motion. There was certainly plenty of time for the France striker to reflect on the meaning of the kick he was about to take.

The injury that ruled Franck Ribéry out of the 23 late in the day left Benzema as France’s most experienced player in the current squad. This was his 67th appearance, over an enigmatic spell with Les Bleus that spans seven years. And yet, as he stood over the ball, the importance of this moment for himself as well as his country was inescapable. In all that time Benzema had never scored a goal in a major finals. It was a sequence he could ill afford to extend.

He stared down, eyes on the ball. The game until that point had irritated like a relentless toothache. Benzema had been clumped in a challenge, headed a free-kick with rueful softness, shot into a defender when he might have passed to a free team-mate. He took a breath and thumped his penalty home. It was a liberating moment. In the elation of the celebration was an obvious sense of how dearly he craved a tournament goal for his CV.

Benzema is the focal point for a France attack that has emerged from a period of struggle. Goals were hard to come by at the midway point of their World Cup qualification campaign. The Real Madrid striker epitomised this problem when he endured a long spell, of well over a calendar year, without an international goal. As recently as last March his place in the natural order of the French attack was under such intense scrutiny that stories calling for the axe were commonplace. “Benzema, that’s enough” was the exasperated headline in L’Equipe as his goalless run lengthened and confidence plummeted.

After 1,222 barren minutes, Benzema was unshackled by a goal in a springtime friendly against Australia. Since then, he has blossomed in the blue jersey. That successful penalty to alter the complexion of a difficult assignment against the spoiling Hondurans was his seventh goal in as many matches.

It was a vital turning point. The breakthrough brought immense relief for a France team that had been frustrated and provoked (precariously so in the case of the altercation where Wilson Palacios goaded Paul Pogba’s self restraint – the precious midfielder might have seen red, before Palacios was eventually removed for his serial fouling). Honduras took no notice of the prevailing spirit of adventure that has finessed the opening to this World Cup.

Such aggressive killjoy tactics were a challenge to a France team that has recently developed a new attacking verve. Even so, the combination of Benzema’s intelligent runs, with Mathieu Valbuena and newcomer Antoine Griezmann zipping and passing skilfully around him, augers well for Didier Deschamps. He has options, with the height of Olivier Giroud and the more direct pace of Loïc Rémy to throw into the mix, too. There is interesting scope for varation there.

The movement among France’s attacking trio was encouraging, with the supporting cast from midfield also keen to arrive in search of a goal.

Benzema’s status as the attacking kingpin was cemented just after half-time, even if the circumstances were bizarre, as his smart volley cracked against the inside of the far post, along the goalline, and only just in off the Honduras goalkeeper before he grabbed it. The zany goalline technology quiz shouldn’t take anything away from Benzema’s crafted technique, though.

The longer the game went on, the more Benzema began to enjoy the experience, and when he scored again with a rasping drive from a sharp angle he gave notice of his intention to make a striking statement in Brazil. He was not selected for the 2010 World Cup – which in hindsight turned out to be no bad thing. His stock for country and club, where he is the valued Real Madrid attacking pivot around whom Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale roam free, has never been so high.

Having waited years for this moment, Benzema at last looks at home on the World Cup stage.",Karim Benzema’s joie de vivre gives Honduras killjoy tactics short shrift,http://www.theguardian.com,"[David Hytner, Simon Burnton, Amy Lawrence, Andy Hunter, Nick Miller, Jacob Steinberg]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402867341740/Frances-Karim-Benzema-rig-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=249c8c1d6c90740fe3e71c9a4780ba1d,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/15/karim-benzema-france-honduras-world-cup-2014

867,"Brazil, it turns out, can do funny things even to the steadiest traveller. Four days into the opening chapter of this World Cup of goals, counter-attack and intense high-speed incision it turns out even Roy Hodgson has joined the party, squeezing himself into his skinniest pair of tactical jeans and by the end of a steamy night in the perfumed cauldron of the Arena Amazônia pretty much having to be dragged off the dance floor, caipirinha in hand, feet still tapping out a samba of fast-breaking wing play.

By the end of a match England started with three viable centre-forwards, Hodgson had three No10s on the pitch and a midfield two of Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard both of whom have also been known to play behind a front man in their time. Attack they said. And England did. Which is all very well. But what about the details behind this. Specifically – what about that defence?

In a way Hodgson is already unlucky at this World Cup. It is perhaps no more than a cyclical thing but the fact is no matter what alchemy he manages to effect on England’s historic weakness – the ingrained straight lines of their attack – he will still be undermined by weakness in a position of historic strength, specifically the lack of depth in defence and a general step down in quality.

England may have attacked with more élan than at any tournament since Euro 2004 and the salad days of Peak Rooney, but the defence looked as callow on the flanks in Manaus as it has at any time in recent tournament history. All analysis is skewed by events – lapses in focus, the excellence of the opposition – but there is a fair chance had Hodgson been blessed with the 2002 World Cup defence England would currently be celebrating a creditable draw at least, with Hodgson’s flank-based cavaliers praised for their sense of vim.

Of course the two things are linked. On paper a left flank of Wayne Rooney and Leighton Baines is some way short of catenaccio-style lockdown, while Danny Welbeck and Glen Johnson on the right is a defence of attackers. Against this, Manaus was a first defeat for Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill as a starting pair in 13 matches, and England were hardly ripped to shreds on the flanks by Italy. It is more that at vital moments they were lacking the unwavering precision and focus required against a team of Italy’s well-seasoned craft. Baines was beaten too easily for the cross that led to Mario Ballotelli’s winning goal.

Small margins of course, just as Claudio Marchisio’s opener for Italy was a fine execution helped by a dreamy full body shrug of a dummy by Andrea Pirlo. But the ball still managed to travel 60 yards across and through England’s defence without a defender or midfielder touching it, reading the play, or at least preventing Marchisio having such a strollingly easy touch before his shot.

Fine margins again, but high-class defending is a matter of fine margins and instinctive hustling intelligence. England will be punished again here for such slackness. Luis Suárez’s ferreting-off-the-cuff sense of adventure is entirely geared to punishing moments of doubt in a less than perfect defence. How to tighten without losing that fast-breaking panache is Hodgson’s challenge now.

The most obvious solution can be dispensed with straight away. Ashley Cole, the best defensive left-back in England, is currently on holiday. And here is the slight discord in Hodgson’s approach. If England really are going to play with their most progressive front four, perhaps they might have considered selecting more defensively secure full-backs.

In Manaus, with both full-backs more exposed than they have been, a little bit of Cole, an expert one-on-one defender, might have been just the thing. As for right-backs, in a fallow time the best purely defensive option might have been Phil Jones (which feels a little odd as a statement in itself) or perhaps Johnson’s Liverpool team-mate Jon Flanagan, who is not in the squad.

At least in showing vulnerability on the flanks England are once again keeping up with the broader trends of this tournament. The dominance of the possession game and the condensing of space in midfield has transformed full-back play in recent years. The defensive technician has often been phased out in favour of ball-playing marauders able to tuck into midfield where required or play high up the pitch as an attacking overload. It is here that the counterattacking revolution so clearly apparent at the start of this World Cup has often struck with so many goals coming from that space a defensive full-back might have occupied.

Croatia exploited Dani Alves’s wanderlust in the opening match. Ivory Coast scored two lovely goals from headers against Japan. The supply line from Daley Blind on Holland’s left was key to the demolition of Spain. Poor full-back cover and a lack of tightness has been a tangible feature in the festival of goals spectators have enjoyed so far, an example of one emerging system (counterattack) intersecting productively with a point of weakness in another as it recedes a little.

Quite what England do about all this now is a more immediate question. There is, of course, a nice paradox in the spectacle of a renowned defensive coach retreating into the jungle and emerging Kurtz-like as a prophet of attacking abandon. But Hodgson’s instincts remain and he will surely instruct Rooney or whoever plays on the left to track back more diligently to cover Baines in São Paulo. The alternative is to introduce a more midfielder-ish presence on the flank. James Milner is an underrated footballer when played anywhere other than as a shuttle runner in a 4-4-2. He has filled that advance flank role brilliantly for Manchester City at times.

Beyond this, England must simply work with what that they have. It feels essential whatever the result in Manaus that they maintain that spirit of adventure, but perhaps with the wings of their flying full-backs clipped a little, and with wide attackers and the central pivot always wary of the Brazil 2014-style threat of the flanks.

873,"The extravagant, whirligig personalities you find in football in other countries, the kind of loquacious carousers of the round ball town-square who are always going for the quip at all costs, don’t feature much in the Australian game. True to that character, there are no great personalities in this Australian side. The Socceroos aren’t big on larrikinism. The pranks they pull are pretty lame, and they don’t do comedy well – which is no great problem, when you consider that the prime minister, Anthony Abbott, is so good at supplying so many of the laughs on their behalf.

These Socceroos are sensible, focused athletes, and national recognition of the sport they play, while growing, is still comparatively slim. That lack of saturated media attention has its benefits, arguably providing a kind of unintended insulation against the megalomania that can form in the minds of some professionals in the other football codes. But mostly, it means that the team makes for pretty dull quote fodder: when you attend a Socceroos press conference, the players usually speak in the kind of flat, expressionless, vaguely distracted affect of 10-year-olds answering questions from their family dentist.

At the post-match press conference on Friday, Ange Postecoglou was true to type, bearing the droopy expression of a suburban plumber frustrated at an unproductive conversation with a parts supplier. But as the Socceroos filed through the media mixed zone in the moments after Postecoglou had finished talking, something different was in the air. Like their coach, the players were disappointed by the defeat to Chile; but more than that, they were angry. There was a jagged edge to the words, unusual for men whose answers normally wander off into a kind of mumbled, media-trained middle ground of rote, balanced optimism. Nothing summed up the mood in the camp better than the volley Tim Cahill, who speaks with greater authority than any other Socceroo, unleashed on the Chileans for “cheating” and shirt-pulling their way to victory. It was an extraordinary display of calculated verbal viciousness from a player whose obvious passion on the field has so often failed to last the journey beyond the sideline.

To be fair, by the gold standard of the Socceroos’ experiences of shirt-pulling in a World Cup group match, Chile wasn’t even half a Croatia. But Cahill’s actual words weren’t the point. The Socceroos weren’t just angry at the referee, or the Chileans; they were above all angry at themselves, because for long periods of the second half, as the men in red tired and Australia pressed forward in search of an equaliser, they knew the outcome of the match was within their control. Disappointment is an emotion played out in the key of acquiescence; anger is a call to action. Despite the obvious and widely proclaimed enormity of the obstacle before them, the Socceroos will travel to Porto Alegre with renewed belief in their ability to spring an upset.

The loss to Chile was heavily front-loaded; the whole game was shaped by the first 15 minutes. If the Chileans got a touch lucky for their first goal, a collection of bobbles and bounces in which knees and shoulders played a more significant role than feet, their second was unquestionably the result of poor defending, Eduardo Vargas selling three Socceroos defenders a dummy to leave Jorge Valdivia unmarked and with plenty of time to measure his precisely planted shot into the top left corner. The magnitude of the Socceroos’ resurgence from there was as great and surprising as the magnitude of their capitulation in the game’s opening stanza. It took 20 minutes but eventually the Socceroos settled into a momentum with a pleasingly defined identity, revolving around quick movement of the ball, the fearless running of Mathew Leckie, and Cahill’s unstinting appetite for the aerial fight. This was more than we were ever promised – or saw, for that matter – during the Holger Osieck or Pim Verbeek eras. With the team unquestionably improving from game to game over the last month and Postecoglou beginning to leave a firm stylistic imprint, at last the Socceroos are starting to play with the brio that Australia has always imagined itself – as a nation purveying a certain sense of the sporting style – to embody.

Luck will still play a big part from here, of course, and the Socceroos did not, as many had hoped, get lucky against Chile. But they did get Leckie, and in the powerful, direct running of the Socceroos’ triple-helping of a right winger, who with Cahill was the standout performer against Chile, there was something that seemed to rouse the whole team, stunned early on by the double-blow of Chile’s two goals, to attack. Leckie dragged his team-mates back to their senses, and his performance on Friday – as crow-eyed a tribute to the get-it-done spirit of no-bullshit Australiana as you’re ever likely to see in a gold jersey, regardless of the code – was the kind of thing that can make a career, not to say bring a flagging World Cup campaign back to life. Leckie, it’s worth noting, is almost the same height and weight as Brazil’s Hulk. And who is Hulk, really, but Brazil’s Mathew Leckie?

The FSV Frankfurt man, of course, is still only 23; his collaborator-in-chief on Friday, Ivan Franjic – now sadly ruled out of the tournament – is 26; and Jason Davidson, who capped a fine game on the left of the defence with a textbook sliding tackle to deny Mauricio Isla a clear shot on goal in the second half, is just 22. The excellence of these players on Friday provided vindication of Postecoglou’s faith in youth, and a firm basis for optimism about the Socceroos’ next phase of post-Brazil development, however important the contributions of Mark Bresciano and Cahill were on Friday and will continue to be over the next 10 days.

In a strange way, the team impressed as much by who didn’t play well as who did. On the left flank, Tommy was an oar in search of a rowboat, his manful, lungs-out early willingness to get in behind the famously defence-averse Chilean full-backs eventually dissipating into the fizzled anonymity of a couple of miscontrols and runs that no one playing in a gold shirt seemed much to want to feed the ball towards. In the absence of Robbie Kruse and Tom Rogic, Australian football’s genies-apparent, Oar has always figured as the one Socceroo likely to do something special in Brazil (something special on the field, that is; I don’t mean that he’s about to break into fluent Brazilian-Portuguese after half an hour on Duolingo, although that might be equally worthy of celebration if it does happen). The fact that he had such a quiet game against Chile offers some hope for the challenge that lies ahead against the Dutch. Either Oar will find his ocean, or exit this World Cup slowly dying under a fine rain of bad puns.

As the Socceroos filed past the media on Friday clutching their FFA-approved dinners, ready to board the flight back to their base camp in Vitoria, it was hard not to be left with the sense that these players, now convinced of their ability to compete against the best, will march into the game against Holland with rejuvenated self-belief. On present form the Dutch are the scariest team at the tournament; their front three of Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben, and Robin Van Persie presents the paradox of supplying both the World Cup’s most geriatric assembly of haircuts and its most youthfully incisive attacking force. But in tournament terms, the Socceroos are now exactly where they were after 20 minutes against Chile. The early anxiety has been shaken out. Confidence and determination are in abundant supply. And there was enough in the loss to Chile to suggest that, if they sort out their positioning and coordination in the centre of defence, start the game with less deference, and take their chances in the final third, they might just do a number on the moral now-world champions. That’s a lot of conditions to satisfy, of course. But no one ever said this would be easy. And on Friday night’s evidence, this is unquestionably a Socceroos team that likes it hard.",Mathew Leckie's no-nonsense Australiana is a Socceroos weapon,http://www.theguardian.com,[Aaron Timms],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402816158569/f1063708-6cd6-40b2-89f6-dd37f0892850-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=df2842b4ec4ae422bc6311aa239189f9,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/16/mathew-leckie-socceroos-world-cup

877,"The PSG midfielder was at his very best in the win over Honduras and forms a powerful and creative midfield alongside Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi

There was less than a minute remaining when Yohan Cabaye was rumbled. He had played a part in creating two of France’s three goals against Honduras and looked like a man highly satisfied with his night’s work as he casually leaned back on the substitutes’ bench, wrapped his arms around Laurent Koscielny and Paul Pogba and stroked them both affectionately on the back of the head. Cabaye was lost in the moment until he looked up and realised that everyone in the stadium was watching him on the giant screen.

While Cabaye chuckled and Koscielny looked a little embarrassed, the reality is that nobody in Brazil would have batted an eyelid. As anyone who has spent time in this country will tell you, they are quite fond of a public display of affection. In fact, they can’t get enough of it, whether on the street, in a restaurant or anywhere else.

Whether some of that is rubbing off on Cabaye or not is unclear but the former Newcastle United midfielder was certainly entitled to be pleased with what he produced on the pitch during France’s opening game in Brazil. Operating as a deep‑lying midfielder, Cabaye made France tick, using the ball intelligently not only to start moves but also to deliver decisive passes when he ventured further forward.

His numbers were impressive. He made 78 passes during his 65 minutes on the pitch and all but three found a French shirt. One of his floated deliveries picked out Paul Pogba in the penalty area only for the Juventus midfielder to be barged over by Wilson Palacios, inviting Karim Benzema to convert from the spot. Another similar pass led to Benzema striking a post before Noel Valladares, the Honduras goalkeeper, nudged the ball over his goalline.

In other words, Cabaye was not merely going from side to side with the ball and off-loading it at the earliest opportunity to those with more ability or, to borrow Eric Cantona’s rather crude description of Didier Deschamps, the France manager, acting like “un porteur d’eau”.

While it is a relatively new way of playing for Cabaye, who has spent so much of his career further forward, it is easy to see the merits of deploying a gifted passer with a football brain in a position where he is going to be more involved and able to dictate play – Carlo Ancelotti had the same idea with Andre Pirlo at Milan.

Deschamps’s decision makes even more sense when the indefatigable Blaise Matuidi, who was unlucky not to score against Honduras, and the immensely talented Paul Pogba are operating just in front of Cabaye. That trio provide a bit of everything in the centre of the France midfield and seem to be developing a decent understanding.

“I’m gradually adapting to a position that I’ve not played all that often at club level,” Cabaye said last week. “I like being at the origin of our attacks and running hard to win the ball back. I enjoy the role, and Blaise, Paul and I continue to work together to improve and make things even more automatic between us.

“We get on well on the pitch. We’re able to find each other easily, and our jobs are clearly defined. I have a more defensive role than the other two; I stay in front of the defence and cover for the full-backs when they go forward. Another task of mine is to remind one of my fellow midfielders to either remain alongside me or to support the attack.

“They both like to get forward, so it’s the ideal arrangement. They finish off moves, score goals, get back quickly and regain possession. We communicate with each other brilliantly, and we’re not afraid to keep the ball between the three of us, interchanging in tight spaces to start off an attack.”

France, of course, have been blessed with some wonderful midfields in the past, from Le Carré Magique in the mid-80s – the Magic Square of Michel Platini, Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse and Luis Fernández – through to the team that won the World Cup in 1998 with Zinedine Zidane, Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit (Patrick Vieira was on the bench), which leaves the current generation with quite an act to follow.

How good Pogba, Cabaye and Matuidi can be as a triumvirate is impossible to say at this stage and it will take much more than a routine win over a limited Honduras team who played with 10 men for 47 minutes before that question can be properly answered.

One of the doubts might be whether they would be exposed defensively against better opponents. In terms of Pogba, the former Manchester United midfielder will need to demonstrate greater self-control than he did against Honduras, when Deschamps admitted the 21-year-old could easily have been sent off for retaliating in the face of provocation from Palacios.

All in all, though, it was an extremely positive start to the tournament for France and something to build upon. Benzema, in particular, looked like a player performing at the top of his game, while Antoine Griezmann, who scored 20 goals for Real Sociedad last season, and Mathieu Valbuena, the Marseille winger, both showed some nice touches on the flanks.

Behind them Cabaye was conducting operations. He has struggled to hold down a first-team place at Paris Saint-Germain since his £20m move from Newcastle in January, largely because of the performances of Italy’s Marco Verratti, but Sunday night provided a reminder of what the 28-year-old can contribute.

Not that everyone on Tyneside enjoyed the experience. “As a Newcastle fan, watching Cabaye is like seeing an ex-girlfriend who’s lost a stone and looks even better than when she dumped you,” Graeme Swann, the former England cricketer, tweeted.",World Cup 2014: Yohan Cabaye the pass master in France’s new triumvirate,http://www.theguardian.com,[Stuart James],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402903725756/Yohan-Cabaye-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d8058215f49b8bd8e4893b4d6df61415,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/16/yohan-cabaye-france-honduras-world-cup-2014
879,"Roy Hodgson can't win for losing. He picked a young team; he prioritised pace; he made Raheem Sterling his star man; and he sent his team out to attack Italy. England were bright, pacey, exciting and positive. They had 18 shots (more than Holland managed against Spain), nine corners and 48% of possession (considerably better than the measly 37% share they acquired against Italy at Euro 2012, when the Italians had a preposterous 31 shots to England's eight). More than anything, they looked like a team who were enjoying the experience of playing at the World Cup.

But they lost. And so the recriminations have begun. Intriguingly, and predictably, most observers want Hodgson to do the same thing: move Wayne Rooney.

One section of England's support want Rooney to be elevated to the centre of England's attack, where he can influence the game more, hold on to the ball and pick out Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling. The other group of fans want him demoted to the bench.

Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes have made the seemingly obvious point that Hodgson should play the team's best player in his best position, but other observers, who have not spent a decade playing with Rooney at Old Trafford, suggest that he is no longer the team's most effective attacker and that, if he isn't good enough to dislodge Sterling from the No10 role, he shouldn't be picked at all.

897,"Fifa's goal-line technology used in the France and Honduras game confused no one except the BBC's Jonathan Pearce. So which other commentators have scored an own goal so far?

Name: Jonathan Pearce.

Age: 54.

Appearance: Jowly, crumpled, confused.

Why's that? Well he was commentating on the World Cup match between France and Honduras for the BBC.

Yes. And a shot from the French striker Karim Benzema hit the inside of the post, rolled along the line, and may have bounced off the Honduran keeper into the goal. Immediately, Fifa's new technology signalled a goal to the referee, and he awarded one.

Gosh, how terribly exciting for people who give a toss. Yes, and Pearce certainly is one. So when an animation then appeared on the stadium screens showing the ball not crossing the line, with the words ""NO GOAL"", he went fully crackers, shouting: ""It signals no goal! No goal has gone up on the screen!""

Except? Except what everybody had just watched was the first contact between the ball and the post. The screens immediately went on to show the second contact with the goalkeeper, confirming that it had indeed marginally crossed line. The word ""GOAL"" then appeared.

Presumably this calmed Pearce down? Rather the opposite. ""Oh goodness me!"" he shouted. ""They've changed their minds now! Does goal-line technology work or doesn't it?""

I'm getting a bit confused myself. Basically, the answer is yes. After many years' of waiting, goal-line technology has finally been introduced, and was needed in a big match, and has proved that it works perfectly, confusing nobody except Jonathan Pearce, who kept countering for the rest of the match. His co-commentator Martin Keown tried explaining what had happened, but to no avail.

I see. So is Pearce normally a halfwit? No, but he gets shouty when roused. I think he was just terribly excited because he thought he had another bit of Fifa incompetence on his hands. Luckily for him, he's not the only commentator making a prat of himself at this World Cup.

Who are the others? Well, despite being quite informative, Phil Neville was roundly mocked for sounding (and perhaps being) utterly bored throughout the England match. Keown himself spent half the Honduras game admiring all the fouls, and even described one French player as ""more of a man"" than another. Andy Townsend continues trying to pass off ""I've seen em given, Clive"" as worldly wisdom whenever someone claims a penalty …

899,"Laden with institutional bureaucracy and hampered by protracted funding and publishing systems, the juggernaut of university research is slow to change direction. In an era of rapid global change, are universities really the best places for progressive research?

A quiet revolution is happening – independent research organisations and DIY labs have been popping up around the world, and with scientists becoming increasingly despondent about academia, the attractiveness of startup organisations is growing.

Independent research organisations are usually created to address a particular issue like wildlife conservation or space exploration, while DIY labs are typically based around open-source principles, providing community access to lab kit and to scientific training. Both offer alternative models for research that deserve attention in the face of discontentment of university research communities.

While some academics remain adamant that universities are the only place to do serious research, the space industry tells a different story.

The space exploration startup SpaceX was founded in 2002 to bypass bureaucratic delays associated with government-run organisations. Far from failing because of a lack of top-down management from a university executive board, SpaceX became the first private company to launch and return a spacecraft, and in 2012 signed a contract with NASA to provide the next generation of space flight.

Those sharp enough to have noticed that SpaceX was founded by someone with ample access to funding could look to the 2013 launch of OSSI-1, an open-source satellite, by a private individual for inspiration on big science on a small budget.

DIY labs can harness talent

Although it's evident that good, serious research can be done by startups and DIYers, aren't the best researchers found at universities? If anything, the opposite may be true, and corporations have caught on to the fact that the best and the brightest are often not to be found gracing the halls of university ivory towers.

DIY labs and startups offer the chance to harness this talent, allowing anyone to get involved in science and to perform their own research without the need for formal qualifications.

It is also becoming easier to set up an independent lab. The power of 3D printing for making affordable lab equipment, and citizen science for increasing feet on the ground, will help to fuel the progress of DIY labs. The rise of low-cost non-profit open access publishing models is beginning to enable research findings to be shared and further reduce the reliance on the university model of research.

Freedom to pursue research

Access to conventional research funding remains difficult for new organisations and DIYers, as the UK research councils open up their funding only to large eligible independent research organisations. Nevertheless, being forced to move away from traditional research funding models can offer great advantages, including faster access to funds, and more freedom to pursue research that might be deemed unfundable by a risk-averse research council.

Crowdfunding for research is on the increase and offers a real alternative. Unlike public consultations by research councils, crowdfunding offers citizens the chance to vote with their wallets, meaning that science that benefits the most people is likely to be the easiest and quickest to fund. This model offers an agility unrivalled by universities, allowing fast and flexible local-scale, solution-driven research by citizens, for citizens.

Forging such direct links between society and science can only be beneficial. Universities and research councils have increasingly been making strained attempts to improve community relations, but a recent survey showed that half of people still think scientists are secretive, and 69% say that scientists should listen more to ordinary people. Community-based labs have the potential to reduce mysticism and mistrust by changing the very idea of who can do science and what science is.

This is an intriguing time for research – we are in a position where academic careers are unappealing and insecure, meanwhile technologies such as crowd-funding and citizen science offer real alternatives for talented pioneers.

Big names are coming on board to encourage the formation of new labs, with UNICEF offering a model for solution-driven innovation labs, and DIY community labs like GenSpace in New York are thriving. Are we approaching a perfect storm that could significantly alter the research landscape?

901,"Not sure whether to buy LEDS, CFLs or halogen bulbs? Let's shed some light on electricity costs

The average UK home has 34 lights. Seems like a lot? Whether or not that statistic has been skewed by the 40,000 lightbulbs in Buckingham Palace, if you count all of the lights you have around your home, you’d probably be surprised at the number you find.



All of these lights use energy and, as well as remembering to turn them off when they’re not needed, replacing older, less efficient lightbulbs is one of the simplest ways we can reduce our energy consumption at home and save on our bills.



If you’re not sure where to start, here are some things to consider:

Know your bulbs



There are now three types of main types of lightbulb available to buy; LEDS, CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps) and halogens. Halogen bulbs are the least efficient, using three times as much energy as CFLs and four times as much as LEDs. What’s more, most of them are designed to last for only two years, so if you are buying replacements, we would advise steering clear of them.

Look at the energy label



The best performing bulbs available are A+ rated. Try to aim for an A or A+ rated bulb if you can.

Check the lifetime



When you are thinking of changing a lightbulb, it’s very important to think about ""lifetime cost"". A relatively more expensive LED might last up to 20 years, CFLs last up to 10 years, and halogen bulbs around two years. Where the initial outlay can feel expensive, you are likely to see an LED bulb paying for itself in under three years and a CFL within a year.

What about watts?



Think about the rooms you are lighting and what you need. For CFL bulbs, 14W is equivalent to an old 60W bulb while 23W is equivalent to 100W. See this handy guide for working out what lighting you need.

Whether you go for CFLs or LEDs, make sure you recycle your old lightbulbs correctly.



Turn them off



Modern lightbulbs turn on instantly and warm up in less than a minute. So for domestic lamps it is never more efficient to leave it switched on, even if you’re only leaving the room for a few minutes.

Dim the lights

Dimmable versions of both CFL and LED retrofit bulbs are available. Some require a dimmer switch to be installed, but some don’t even need that meaning your lounge can become a sophisticated boudoir by simply replacing one bulb.

905,"What happened when a UK paint manufacturer charged a group of designers with upcycling some of their favourite finds?

Upcycling is the buzzword in charity shops and car boot sales: find a piece fit only for landfill, get all cut-and-stick crafty with it and transform it into something with a new lease of life, ready to be loved once more.

In recent years, a number of creatives have moved away from the ""make do and mend"" movement, repurposing vintage pieces, adding their personality and converting them into contemporary heirlooms. Furniture from Zoe Murphy and Ines Cole (both stocked at Liberty) show that reworked items can hold their own against the brand new – and carry price tags to match. The likes of Polly Granville's elaborate upholstery and Pelikan's reworked mid-century classics grace some of the UK's most slick interiors.

While transforming tack into something tasteful is undoubtedly harder than it looks, with a bit of creativity, the right tools and instructions, it can be achieved. To prove this Farrow & Ball – makers of the nation's favourite paint shades of Mouse's Back and Elephant's Breath – has collaborated with a group of British designers to create bespoke items of painted furniture.

""We selected people with different styles so we could demonstrate the breadth of what you could achieve,"" says Farrow & Ball's Charlotte Cosby.

They've taken pieces of their own furniture and created inspiring pieces using varied paint effects. Here's our pick of the best.

Charlotte Cosby



Charlotte Cosby advises on colour, pattern and print at Farrow & Ball.

""I'm a fan of clean, graphic motifs and wanted to do something achievable. I chose the little chest because of its shape. It's simple, but the slanted drawers add interest. ""

Why upcycle? ""Being overloaded with technology leaves our hands crying out for something crafted. Upcycling is an easy way for anyone to get involved without having to invest in costly equipment. If you upcycle well, your piece should look better than it did. It's definitely not a case of 'make do and mend'.""

Michael Angove



RCA graduate Michael Angove is a freelance designer.

""I painted a Japanese-inspired chinoiserie. I started with pale bamboos in the background and moved on to darker, curving blossom trees. Then I added thousands of dainty blossom flowers and finished with bright butterflies. I wanted to create a timeless piece, elegant but fresh and unrecognisable from the original.""

Why upcycle? ""To create a one-off item. I also wonder what happens to the furniture we throw away. This slows down that process.""

Daniel Heath



Daniel Heath is a wallpaper, textile and surface designer.

""My chair was inspired by art deco architecture and visits to Charleston Farmhouse and Berwick church in Sussex. Both are filled with furniture hand-painted by Bloomsbury group members Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, which fired my imagination. History has an important role in my work.""

Why upcycle? ""Upcycling revisits materials and designs from many different eras, exploring many different aesthetics.""

Shamus Pitts



Shamus Pitts also works at Farrow & Ball.

""For my silhouette drawers, I was inspired by Forms in Nature, a light sculpture by Hilden & Diaz. I like the idea that with just a simple painted shadow you can hint at spaces or objects that are just out of sight.""

Why upcycle? ""Upcycled furniture can look as shabby or as chic as you like; it depends how much time you're prepared to put in and the finish that you're after. Why replace a favourite piece just because it's starting to look dated? Transform it instead.""

Nathan Philpott and Jemma Ooi



Nathan Philpott and Jemma Ooi met while studying at the Royal College of Art. They founded Custhom design studio in 2009.

""We have always had an interest in typography and Bauhaus design theories, looking at what is not a visible graphic being just as important as the graphics themselves. After finding our blank credenza, we wanted to highlight the natural wood, respond to the shape and size of the cabinet and think about how people use colour in their homes.""

Why upcycle? ""People tend to have a preconceived idea of what an upcycled product will look like, usually thinking it will be mismatched, brightly coloured and the kind of unsophisticated thing you see stapled together on day-time TV. But there are many other options to the concept of upcycling – it's all in the execution and design.""

Fiona Douglas



Fiona Douglas set up the Scottish textile design company Bluebellgray.

""This is my grandfather's old sea chest. He was in the navy during the war, and I know he would have loved me to give it an update. His beautiful colour- and flower-filled garden in Devon is the inspiration. Upcycling something with memories and meaning attached to it made it even more special.""

Why upcycle? ""Think of it as giving something a new lease of life. The best items have already stood the test of time. With a bit of care they could give more happiness than a new product could.""",Homes: upcycling,http://www.theguardian.com,[Ben Spriggs],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/28/1401292388780/Homes-Charlotte-Cosby-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=a4681c3d6f0f21eb444fc9ea19a4eb6b,2014-06-06 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/06/homes-upcycling
907,"Danish design has long been a byword for cool, simple elegance. But it can be austere. Leonardo Clausi travels to Copenhagen to see how a new generation is softening up

When it comes to creating space to live in, the Danes seem effortless, natural and spontaneous in their approach, influenced perhaps by the landscape and the light.

Danish interiors look sleek, but are also welcoming and warm, and they rarely take a false step when it comes to the meeting of form and function. In recent years, as a reaction to the severity of the past masters – the Wegners, Jacobsens and Mogensens – a certain pop sensibility has emerged, a vibe of playfulness. And the crème of contemporary Scandinavian talent is in on the act.

The A_light by Anour

This is classic, rigorous, minimalistic Danish design. Handmade using brass, aluminium or copper on which an outdoor patina gradually builds up, it's not for the Ikea-hearted. ""Most Danish crafts have been made obsolete in the modern design production. I want to preserve these trades and improve on the life cycle of products,"" says Iranian-born architect Arash Nourinejad, founder of Anour (which means light in Farsi). Preserving traditional Danish craft is a national preoccupation, and Anour – whose presence underscores Copenhagen's role as a magnet for international talent – makes perfect use of the space and dimensions that are the nation's aesthetic signature.

909,"Maeve Haran's 90s novel about a working mum struck a chord with women around the world. As it is republished, does her daughter think we have moved on?

Holly Graham, 25, works for a company that makes online videos. ""I work in media, which is good for working women, and tech, which can be tougher. I work a lot more than nine to five, so if I met someone and we wanted a family I wouldn't be uncomfortable with him becoming a househusband, if that suited him too.""

Two decades ago Holly's mother, Maeve Haran, 64, wrote Having It All, a novel that tells the story of ambitious Liz Ward, who is successful in television, a profession dominated by men working 14-hour days. She misses her children. The book charts how she gives it all up for family life and to work from home as a novelist.

The book mirrored Haran's own career – we met when we were television researchers – and pressed an international button. It sold well in 26 countries. It didn't matter that Haran was arguing for a better work-life balance, what Latin American readers called equilibrio, the book was viewed as a defeat for feminism, proof that women couldn't have it all. The book has just been republished, and last week avowed ""passionate feminist"", arts and crafts diva Kirstie Allsopp, gave the question fresh topicality, telling girls to delay university. ""At the moment, women have 15 years to … get their career on track, try and buy a home, and have a baby,"" she said. ""That is a hell of a lot to ask someone."" Allsopp wasn't blaming female ambition or feminism. ""Women are being let down by the system,"" she said unequivocally.

Unlike the 1990s, women now make up half of the university population and fill half of the professions. ""But it's still primarily women who take the day off when the child is sick,"" says Haran. ""Work is still inflexible, a world made by men, for men. Ambition matters, but quality of life has to count too.""

""It's a question of control,"" says Penny Mansfield of the relationship charity One Plus One. ""Women have always been subject to the control of others. So mothers in paid work often feel that, rather than having it all, they are doing it all and none of it well. That can be extremely stressful."" The workplace is changing, but in the decades since Having It All sparked an international debate why is the pace of progress so haphazard? And is that likely to change?

In 1987 Sylvia Ann Hewlett published A Lesser Life: The Myth of Women's Liberation. Until men did more domestically, she argued, only spinsters would reach the top. Women be warned. In 2012, in Atlantic magazine, Anne-Marie Slaughter, the first female director of policy planning in the US state department and the mother of two teenage boys, wrote about the difficulties she faced in an article headed ""Why women still can't have it all"". ""We have to stop accepting … male choices as a default. We must insist on bending the career track to accommodate our choices too,"" she said.

Fiona Hathorn, a mother of two, became the youngest head of a global equity desk in the City of London at the age of 32. It was the late 1990s and she was eight months pregnant. ""I had a supportive male boss who believed I had something to offer. I married a man whose mother had been the main breadwinner. He did the early shift with the children and I did the late shift and I could afford a nanny.""

Hathorn founded Women on Boards two years ago to get more women into senior corporate positions. The group now has 7,000 members. Hathorn gives talks to sixth-formers that begin by showing them the picture of a giant baby. ""I say it takes two to make a baby and it takes two to bring it up,"" she says firmly. ""Generation Y understand and embrace the idea that this isn't a woman's issue – but the corporate world doesn't.""

Sarah Jackson of the charity Working Families says: ""We are seeing a shift in some companies. High-flyers are still working ridiculous hours, but they have more control over when and how they work. Companies such as the National Grid and Ford are saying, 'This is what we want you to do, how you do it is up to you'. So it's easier to fit a career around a family life.""

According to figures published last week, four million people are now self-employed. That allows a different shape to the working day, and payment on results, not by the hour. Last year the Agile Future Forum was founded by companies such as BT, Tesco and B&Q to promote ""workforce agility"". Flexibility, including working from home, which is usually seen as a concession to female employees, is now being recognised as a route to greater productivity, lower recruitment costs and higher retention rates. So ""having it all"", when relabelled, can apparently make employers happy.

But progress in one area, the right to request flexible working for instance, comes with setbacks in others. Sarah Jackson says what's available to ""high value"" women does not extend throughout the labour market, where zero-hours contracts and unsocial shifts are increasingly the norm. ""A woman's choice in work is still very relative.""

A further dent to the idea of ""having it all"" is the cost of childcare. It takes a third of net household income in the UK compared with an average of 13% in other OECD countries. Half of mothers with school-age children work 20 or fewer hours (compared with 30% in the OECD). It shouldn't be difficult to climb the professional ladder on a three-day week, but it is.

A mother's ""choice"" is also constrained by what is happening to fathers. They, too, want a family life. ""Nobody has it all. Men also have difficult choices, so why aren't they part of the conversation?"" asks Bea Campbell, author of End of Equality.

""In the 90s we didn't plead family responsibilities, because we were blazing a trail,"" Haran says. ""But we've raised our daughters to want a more balanced life."" A survey of more than 3,200 members of ""Generation Y"" (those born in the 1980s and 90s) across 122 countries in 2010 found that work-life balance figured highly.

Bryony Gordon is 33, married with a baby, works full-time as a journalist and has just written a very funny book, The Wrong Knickers, about ""a decade of chaos"" that was her 20s, trying to have it all instantly. ""We were told by our baby-boomer working mothers [that] you can be everything you want to be,"" she says. ""But so many women still feel terrible about every choice they make. Enough! We need to have the cojones – thank you, Miriam Clegg – to believe that we really can have it all and not feel bad about the different bits of the jigsaw puzzle when they don't fit into place.""

Susanna Abse, of the Tailstock Centre for Couple Relationships, says: ""Men have society's permission to go for ambition. But sometimes it's advantageous to have life interrupted by children. It gives a person time for a rethink – and a second wind."" A recent survey to mark the 25th anniversary of the UK International Women's Forum found the majority had children and did not feel they had made sacrifices. They had also succeeded not in one but several careers because they had to box and cox.

Next week Haran publishes her latest novel, The Time of Their Lives. It's about four women, friends for 45 years, the survivors of juggling children and careers, and now growing old in an ageist society. But that is another story. ""Twenty years on,"" says Haran, ""it's incredible that women are still fighting the same battle."" Her daughter Holly is more optimistic. ""My generation is reimagining what it means to have it all, and trying to get to a point that works for both men and women. A supportive working environment is what's crucial to progress.""","From mother to daughter: '20 years on, having it all is still just a work of fiction'",http://www.theguardian.com,[Yvonne Roberts],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/7/1402155500189/Holly-Graham-with-her-mot-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8b6ac2d706b4aa1ad048a09fb0a76098,2014-06-08 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/08/having-it-all-maeve-haran-daughter

913,"There's no law that says you have to pull out all the stops when you have friends over for dinner. A few simple, stress-free dishes can make just as memorable a meal as more fancy fare

Sometimes it's nice to cook for friends; at other times it is its own special kind of hell. We've all been there, inviting mates round for dinner, thinking it will all be fine, despite a stupidly hectic week at work, poorly offspring and an accidental midweek piss up, which combine to leave you exhausted by the time you have to shop for and cook dinner. And then you realise you're not sure you like the people you've invited all that much anyway. So, here's how to make the best of the situation:

1) Buy posh crisps, olives and those cured meat selection packs, and encourage your guests to help themselves while you sort them, and yourself, out with some nice, cold, fizzy booze. In the trade, we call this part of dinner a canapé reception.

2) Serve a cold starter – ideas below.

3) Keep the main course simple – avoid anything that requires precision cookery. Ideas overleaf.

4) Serve a cold dessert, for the same reasons as the cold starter. Again, options overleaf.

There is a bit of a theme to these. That's because potted things are a) ridiculously easy; b) unusual enough to get away with without friends shouting, ""Cop out!""; and c) taste really nice. All serve four.

Potted shrimp

150g double cream

40g melted butter

150g cooked brown shrimp

A pinch of grated mace or nutmeg

A pinch of cayenne or black pepper

Juice and zest of 1 lemon

Salt

With a hand blender, blitz the cream into the butter, then stir in the other ingredients. Pack into ramekins and chill. Serve with toast and watercress.

Potted cheese

You can use pretty much any cheese, but a full-flavoured one such as mature cheddar or a blue works best.

200g​ cheese, grated

100g​ unsalted butter

40ml​ madeira, port or sherry

Beat the cheese, butter and booze to a paste, pack into ramekins and chill. Serve with oatcakes or dark rye bread.

Potted smoked fish

200g​ hot smoked salmon, trout or mackerel

100g​ softened butter

12g​ lemon juice

Freshly ground black pepper

Beat together all the ingredients, pack into ramekins and chill. Serve with crusty bread or toast.

Main courses

For simplicity's sake, buy a slab of decent protein, roast it, season it and serve with crushed new potatoes and something green. For pork, do buttered cabbage (slice and sweat in butter, rather than boiling in water); for beef, a peppery/mustardy salad; for fish or chicken, chargrill baby gem on one side, then chop and season with salt, oil and lemon juice.

Pork belly

150g of meat per person, in one piece

Coarse sea salt and black pepper

Juice of ½ lemon

1 onion, peeled and sliced

2 carrots, peeled and sliced

3 star anise

If possible, salt the belly a day ahead; otherwise, do so just before cooking. Score the skin all over, pour boiling water over it, drain and pat dry. Rub salt, a little pepper and lemon juice into the grooves. Put the veg and star anise in a roasting tin, lay the belly on top and cook at 150C/300F/gas mark 2 for three hours (it's even better done at 100C for nine hours). Ten minutes before the end, turn up the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7, to crisp up the crackling.

Beef sirloin

For midweek dinner parties, keep the main course simple, and avoid anything that requires precision cookery – roast beef sirloin, pork belly or a whole roasted fish all fit the bill. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian. Food styling: Claire Ptak

Fillet or boneless rib would also work, but I prefer the texture and flavour of sirloin. If you have a barbecue, it's worth lighting whatever the weather is doing; otherwise, a stove-top griddle pan will do. The trick to impressing with simple food is to go for quality, so if possible buy well-aged beef from a decent butcher.

150g of meat per person, in one piece

Salt and pepper

Olive oil

Half an hour before cooking, rub the sirloin all over with oil and season generously. Heat the griddle and heat the oven to very low (70C or so). Grill the sirloin on all sides – be brave about letting it caramelise –then transfer to the low oven. Roast for 20 minutes or so, then give it a prod to check for doneness. I'd rather eat beef raw than overcooked, but if you prefer it more done, just give it a bit longer in the oven. Remember, it will need to rest for a good 20 minutes before you carve it, during which time it will cook a little more in the residual heat. If, once you slice into the meat, it is more rare than you like, carry on carving, then lay the slices on a baking sheet and return to the oven for a couple of minutes until done to your liking. Before serving, season each slice with coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper.

Sides

Like your choice of main course, keep things simple and manageable.

Crushed potatoes

These go with just about everything, and are delicious hot, warm or at room temperature. Serves four to six.

500g small waxy salad potatoes

200g butter or olive oil

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Juice and grated rind of 2 lemons

Chopped chives/parsley/thyme/chervil/tarragon (optional)

Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, then drain. Stir in the butter or oil, allowing the potatoes to break up a little and absorb some fat. Season, then add the lemon juice and rind, cover and set aside until needed. Add the herbs just before serving.

Desserts

I'm a big fan of English cream-based desserts for their elegant simplicity. And these are very straightforward indeed. All serve four.

Posset

100ml citrus juice – grapefruit, lime or blood orange are especially good

150g caster sugar

400ml double cream

Put all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring all the while, then tip into glasses or teacups, and refrigerate until needed. Serve with shortbread and a scattering of fresh seasonal berries.

Fool

Don't tell anyone I said this, but use frozen fruit if need be – whack the bag with a rolling pin a few times and, hey presto, fruit compote. There are some lovely frozen fruit purees available these days, which would also do the trick. Or be fancy and make your own compote – I use about 15g of sugar per 100g of fruit. Just stew gently until the fruit softens, then push through a sieve.

150ml double cream

150g cold fruit compote – rhubarb, gooseberry and apple all work well (or fruit puree)

Whip the cream to very soft peaks (ie, it should still drop off a spoon when you lift it). Fold in the fruit – don't fold it in fully, but rather leave streaks of colour throughout the cream, which looks much prettier – then transfer to glasses and chill. For extra flavourings, if you're using rhubarb, try a dash of grenadine; for gooseberry, elderflower cordial is good; and for apple, try vanilla and/or cinnamon.

Champagne syllabub

Fruit cider would work instead of the fizz here, while rose lemonade makes a lovely non-alcoholic version.

200ml double cream

20g sugar

80ml champagne (demi-sec is best)

Whip the cream and sugar to very soft peaks, divide between four glasses and chill. Serve everyone a glass of syllabub and a spoon, then pour 20ml champagne into each glass. Your guests need to stir and eat immediately, while the fizz is still frothing – interactive!

Chocolate and pecan tart (above)

The rich fruitiness (and extra vitamins) provided by the avocados, dates and coconut oil here add hidden depth to this chocolate tart. Best served from the fridge, within two days of making it.

Jordan Bourke, jordanbourke.com

Serves 8

150g pecans, plus extra for decorating

10 dried pitted dates

125g oatcakes

1 tsp vanilla extract

2 tbsp maple syrup

2 tbsp extra virgin coconut oil, melted

3 tsp cocoa powder

Pinch of sea salt

For the filling

3 large ripe avocados, peeled and destoned

6 tbsp pure maple syrup

3 tbsp date syrup (or more maple syrup)

6 tbsp cocoa powder

2 tsp vanilla extract

½ tsp sea salt

5 tbsp extra virgin coconut oil, melted

100g dark chocolate, minimum 70% cocoa solids

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and roast the pecans for about 4 minutes, or until they are a shade darker and aromatic – watch them carefully as they burn very quickly. Leave to cool completely.

2 In a food processor, blitz the dates for a few seconds, then add the rest of the ingredients for the base and blitz until everything is very finely chopped and sticks together when pressed between your fingers. Very firmly press the mixture into a 20cm-diameter springform tin, so that you have an even, smooth and compacted base for the tart. Place in the freezer to set for 15-20 minutes.

3 For the filling, place all the ingredients into a food processor, apart from the coconut oil and dark chocolate, then blitz until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as you go. This could take a few minutes, depending on the strength of your machine.

4 With the processor still running, pour in the melted coconut oil until just combined. Pour the mixture on to the set base and smooth out the top. Place in a fridge to set for at least 4-5 hours.

5 When ready to serve, remove the tart from the springform tin and place it on a large white plate. Liberally grate the chocolate over the tart and scatter with extra pecans.

Sprouting kachumbar salad

This super-quick salad proves on one flavour-packed plate that the supremely healthy can also be incredibly delicious. If you're making it for lunchboxes, put the dressing in a separate container and drizzle over just before you eat.

Meera Sodha, meerasodha.com

Serves 6

For the salad

250g baby plum tomatoes, chopped

200g radishes, topped, tailed and finely sliced

½ cucumber, deseeded and finely diced

A bunch of spring onions, finely sliced

40g coriander, chopped

2cm ginger, peeled and finely cut

250g sprouted mung beans and mixed pulses

For the dressing

2 tbsp rapeseed oil

1 tsp salt

1 tsp sugar

2 tbsp wholegrain mustard

Juice of ½ lemon

1 Toss all the salad ingredients into a bowl.

2 Combine all the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl. Whisk with a fork and drizzle over your salad just before serving.

Peanut butter cheesecake with maple bananas

Free-from products are widely available in supermarkets and health food shops. Vegan desserts don't always have to be virtuous – just add a dollop of dairy-free ice-cream or coconut sorbet. Make sure you check the biscuit packet, as some digestives are vegan, others are not.

Andrew Dargue, Orchard Vegetarian Kitchen, orchard-kitchen.co.uk

Serves 4-6

50g dairy-free margarine

100g dairy-free digestive biscuits, crushed

50g dairy-free dark chocolate, finely chopped

225g dairy-free cream cheese

30g soya milk

25g icing sugar

270g crunchy peanut butter

For the bananas

4 bananas

4 tbsp maple syrup

Smoked paprika, for sprinkling

1 Gently melt the margarine in a saucepan over a low heat. Mix the biscuit crumbs into the margarine, stir, then fold in the chocolate.

2 Line a 15cm loose-bottomed or springform tin with baking paper, then add the crumb mix. Use the back of a metal spoon to spread and press down the crumbs to form a base. Allow to cool while you make the filling.

3 Combine the cream cheese, soya milk and icing sugar. Fold the peanut butter in lightly so as to keep a marbled effect. Add the mix to the base and spread evenly.

4 Put the cheesecake in the freezer and leave until firm, but not fully frozen. This should take around 30 minutes, depending on your freezer. When set, remove from the freezer and slice into portions immediately.

5 Set aside for around 10‑15 minutes at room temperature, to let it soften a little before serving.

6 Meanwhile, insert a knife just under the skin of each banana and make an incision from one end to the other. Prise open the banana so the fruit is exposed, but keep the skin on. Spoon 1 tbsp syrup into each banana, making sure they are well coated. Sprinkle a pinch of smoked paprika along the length of the banana and syrup. Wrap the bananas in foil, but scrunch it up so the syrup stays in the bananas. Make sure the foil is well sealed.

7 Bake the bananas at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the foil and serve with the cheesecake.

Poppy seed and black onion crisps

These are fast to make, and last for up to a week in an airtight container. Try serving them with a tomato-based dip.

Bread, Cake, Doughnut, Pudding, Justin Gellatly (Fig Tree)

Makes about 50

200ml rapeseed oil

290ml water

4 tsp black onion seeds

4 tsp poppy seeds

2 tsp fine sea salt

2 tsp caster sugar

600g plain flour

2 tsp baking powder

1 Whisk the oil and water together in a large jug or bowl. Add the other ingredients to another bowl, add the liquid and mix. Once it has become a dough, turn out on to a floured surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in clingfilm and rest overnight, or continue.

2 Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and line two large baking trays with parchment.

3 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 3mm thick. Cut into 4cm rounds. Roll out each round until 1mm thick. Brush off excess flour and bake for 8-10 minutes, until golden brown. Watch them, as they turn from golden to burned quite quickly.

Lime and turmeric tofu steaks with fresh chilli sambal

Many people think they hate tofu, but it's an absorbent ingredient – so as good as the flavours you give it. This zingy marinade will wash away any previous bad experience.

Fired Up Vegetarian, Ross Dobson (Murdoch Books)

Serves 4

60ml lime juice

60ml rapeseed oil

¼ tsp ground turmeric

600g firm tofu, divided into four equal portions

Lime wedges, to serve

For the sambal

1 tsp vegetable stock (bouillon) powder

2 makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced

2 lemongrass stems, pale part only, finely chopped

2 bird's eye chillies, finely chopped

1 banana shallot, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 tbsp vegetable oil

1 tbsp lime juice

1 Combine the sambal ingredients in a bowl, then stir until the stock powder has dissolved. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes, or refrigerate overnight.

2 Combine the lime juice, rapeseed oil and turmeric in a bowl and stir until the spice has dissolved and the oil is vibrantly coloured. Coat the tofu with marinade. Set aside for 30 minutes.

3 Preheat the barbecue or a grill to high. Cook the tofu for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until heated through and slightly crusty. Serve warm, with the sambal spooned over and lime wedges on the side.

Linguine with edamame pesto

Edamame (soya beans) are available in the freezer sections of supermarkets, but if you can't find any, you can also use frozen peas or broad beans.

Isa Chandra Moskowitz, Post Punk Kitchen, theppk.com

Serves 4

300g spinach linguine or other pasta

1 tsp olive oil

Small red onion, thinly sliced

200g chestnut mushrooms, sliced

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

Salt and black pepper

Basil leaves, torn, to serve

Olive oil

For the pesto

2 garlic cloves, chopped

A large handful of basil leaves

A small handful of coriander leaves

400g frozen edamame (soya beans), thawed

100ml vegetable stock

2 tbsp lemon juice

1 tsp olive oil

1 tsp salt

1 To make the pesto, pulse the garlic and basil in a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until relatively smooth. Scrape the sides with a spatula to make sure you get everything. Add more stock if needed.

2 Cook the pasta to al dente, following packet instructions, while you cook the mushrooms. Fry the onion slices over a medium heat for 5 minutes until softened, but not browned. Add the mushrooms, garlic and season. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3 When the mushrooms are cooked, add the pasta and pesto to the pan. Heat through, stirring, for a couple of minutes; if the pesto is too thick (not spreading out and coating the pasta) add a little water. Check the seasoning, then serve immediately with the torn basil leaves sprinkled over the top.

Cinnamon pull-apart brioche

This brioche takes a little time to make, but is more than worth it and freezes well. Try serving with fruit salad or drizzled with maple syrup for brunch.

Celine Steen, havecakewilltravel.com

Serves 6-8

1 tbsp cornflour

120ml water

120ml full-fat coconut milk, at room temperature

3 tbsp granulated sugar

½ tsp salt

250g flour

1 tbsp fast-action yeast

50g dairy-free spread

Vegetable oil, to grease the tin

For the filling

2 tsp ground cinnamon

75g light brown sugar

Flour, for rolling out

Water, to brush the rolled-out dough

1 Put the cornflour in a small bowl. Add 30ml water and stir to dissolve. Add the remaining water, and boil in a small saucepan until slightly gelatinous and cloudy, which takes about 1 minute. Set aside to cool completely.

2 Combine the cooled cornflour mix with the milk, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add flour and yeast, then knead either in a mixer for 2 minutes, or by hand for 4 minutes.

3 Add the dairy-free spread, 1 tbsp at a time, as you knead the dough. Once all of the spread has been slowly added, knead in the mixer for 4 minutes, or by hand for 8-10 minutes. The dough will look like batter, be sticky and not form a ball, even after this much kneading.

4 Put back in the bowl, cover with clingfilm then allow to rise for 45 minutes. Punch the dough back down, cover with clingfilm again then chill for 2 hours, until cold and stiff.

5 To make the filling, mix the cinnamon and sugar in a bowl, then set aside. Generously flour a work surface, then roll the dough into a 20x30cm rectangle. Lightly brush with water, then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.

6 Using a sharp knife, cut the dough lengthwise in four strips. Place the strips on top of each other, sugared-side up. Cut into six stacks, width-wise. Transfer the stacks into a greased 900g loaf tin, with the cut edges facing up.

7 Cover with clingfilm, and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place, or until doubled.

8 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Remove the clingfilm. Bake the brioche for 40 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.

917,"The author Tom Robbins was right when he wrote in his novel Jitterbug Perfume: ""The beet is the most intense of vegetables… The beet is the melancholy vegetable, the one most willing to suffer. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip.""

Just think of that deep, earthy flavour beneath all the sweetness, the glossy leaves and swelling root, supping up all that is good below.

Last year I ran a ribbon of 'Bull's Blood' beets through the garden and left them until early spring, a dark purple vein that looked magnificent on overcast days and resplendent on sunny ones. Then I ate them. 'Bull's Blood' is an awesome beet with deep crimson leaves. Its bloodiness runs so deep that its fine root hairs are stained red. It is not the sweetest, perhaps, nor the most tender, but you don't come to it for that. You come because it is so very intense, so very dark and serious.

I am repeating it this year, raising modules and planting out rather than direct sowing. I sow two or three seeds per module and plant out in this cluster. This allows me to harvest a small beet or two, then leave the last to fatten.

On the allotment, I pursue a different tack. There, I want sweetness and light. I grow patches and rows of baby beets that I can cook quickly. This means endless succession sowing: once one lot is up, time for the next, which is roughly every two weeks.

Beetroot seeds are hard and corky. They need moisture to get going and should be covered with a thin layer of soil or compost. If the soil is dry, water it first. As all parts are edible, I tend to thin in stages: baby leaves for salads, followed by baby and then full-grown beets.

Thompson & Morgan have a collection called Rainbow Beets that, for £1.99, contains all that one might wish for: a deep red globe, a vibrant yellow (sweeter than its red siblings), the candy stripes of 'Chioggia', the pure white 'Albina Vereduna' (the sweetest yet) and 'Bull's Blood Scarletta' (when cut open, it reveals cerise rings inside). You can create your own rainbow by mixing up any leftover seeds.

My only other beet love is the 'Egyptian Turnip Rooted' kind that sits like a disc on the soil. This likes very warm conditions and can be sown now, but will sulk if sown in spring. It has a flavour like no other and a skin that peels off perfectly to reveal smooth flesh. It's particularly good raw with lemon juice, salt and as much olive oil as you like.",Alys Fowler: you can't beat beets,http://www.theguardian.com,[Alys Fowler],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402569160807/Bulls-Blood-beetroot-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=ea65a5bc86a3936a16b72467ad60caab,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/14/alys-fowler-cant-beat-beet-beetroot
919,"City of London gin Photograph: PR shot

With shop windows full of World Cup and Father's Day promotions, it may well have escaped your notice that it's World Gin Day today. Not that we need much encouragement to drink gin at the moment. Pubs are expanding their gin lists faster than you can say botanicals – one of my locals, the Pump House in Bristol, has 176 on offer, and rising (a couple of months ago, it had only 80) – and micro distilleries are popping up all over the place. There are customised gins such as the pea gin the Cambridge Distillery makes for the city's Pint Shop (rather nice, actually), flavoured gins, cask-aged gins, seasonal gins, super-premium gins, gins with silly names such as Psychopomp Woden (no kidding) and gin experiences including the Portobello Star's Ginstitute, where you can blend your own gin for ""only"" £100 a person.

Not all are worth drinking. Sometimes the botanicals seem added more for effect than to enhance the gin, Marks & Spencer's rather nasty mint and cucumber gin being an example. You'd do better adding your own fresh ingredients. And if you're after a bargain, you might as well stick to own-brands or well-known names on promotion. But if you're curious to explore the gin world, try one of these.

I owe my introduction to Bathtub gin (£32.95, Ocado and Master of Malt; 43.3% abv) to my accountant. (He apparently drinks the high-strength version, which he may well need after dealing with my accounts.) It has a folksy sort of image, comes wrapped in brown paper and has an intriguingly complex, earthy flavour.

City of London dry gin (£30.95, the Whisky Exchange; 40% abv) comes from one of the new London distilleries and is a classic, clean London gin with a nice whiff of citrus, including pink grapefruit, in a handsome see-through bottle with an image of St Paul's on it. A good one for your dad.

Opihr gin Photograph: PR shot

For a really original gin, try Opihr oriental spiced London dry (£22 larger branches of Waitrose and Ocado, £23.20 Master of Malt; 40% abv), which has a big spicy hit of black pepper and works brilliantly in a G&T.

And the Psychopomp Woden? I knew you wanted to ask me about that. It's 40% abv, made in Bristol, flavoured with fennel and fresh grapefruit zest, and you should be able to find a bottle, at £34.99, in one of Bristol's better offies, such as Corks of Cotham, Grape & Grind or Weber & Tring's.

921,"Replacing trusty butter with olive oil can give a moister crumb and a bolder fruity flavour to cakes, biscuits and even to your ice-cream accompaniment

I'd be the first to admit that I can get a little carried away with butter: beaten in cake batters, melted into cookies, whole blocks kneaded with brioche dough. The idea of replacing it with margarine (Julia Child would turn in her grave) or vegetable/corn oil holds little appeal. As for doing away with fat altogether – that doesn't bear thinking about. If I'm to wean myself off of butter, I need a worthy alternative: something that can create the same melting tenderness as butter while contributing some unique flavour of its own. Olive oil does exactly that.

Olive oil creates a more moist and less rich crumb than traditional versions, while aromatic thyme steers this citrus cake away from the usual lemon drizzle route and down a more interesting path: herbal, fruity, peppery and zesty all at once.

Serves 6-8

100ml extra virgin olive oil

175g caster sugar

100g full-fat yoghurt

Zest of 2 oranges

Zest of 1 lemon

2-3 tbsp fresh thyme leaves

3 large eggs

175g plain flour

1½ tsp baking powder

½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

¼ tsp salt

For the syrup

Juice of ½ orange

Juice of ½ lemon

50g caster sugar

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease and line a 900g loaf tin.

2 Whisk the oil, sugar, yoghurt, orange and lemon zest, thyme and eggs in a large bowl. Mix the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt in a separate bowl, then add to the wet ingredients and whisk briefly to combine.

3 Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45-60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

4 When the cake is nearly cooked, prepared the syrup: heat the orange and lemon juice and caster sugar in a pan over a medium heat until boiling. Let simmer for a minute or two then set aside, off the heat. Pierce the baked cake all over using a skewer or fork, then pour the syrup all over while still hot. Leave the syrup-drenched cake to cool in its tin, then demould.

Olive oil chocolate chip cookies

It's up to you which type of olive oil you use for these cookies. I like the boldness of extra virgin oil, particularly against the clout of a good dark chocolate, but you might prefer to use a lighter oil to just subtly accentuate the flavour. My favourite way to serve these is to sandwich a scoop of olive oil ice cream between two cookies. It's not my aim to encourage such shameless gluttony in others, but if you do want to give it a go (and you won't regret it), there's a recipe for the olive oil ice cream below.

Makes 12 large cookies

90ml olive oil

160g light brown soft sugar

60ml milk

200g plain flour

¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda

Generous pinch of sea salt flakes, plus more to sprinkle on top

150g dark chocolate, in small chunks

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a couple of large baking trays with baking parchment.

2 Beat the olive oil and sugar together in a large bowl for a minute or so, then stir in the milk. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Add this to the wet mixture along with the chopped dark chocolate and stir to combine.

3 Spoon large mounds of the cookie dough on to the prepared baking trays and sprinkle over a few extra flakes of salt. Bake in the preheated oven for 15‑17 minutes. They're ready when golden brown and well-spread. They'll be quite soft at this point, but will firm up as they cool.

Olive oil ice cream

Use a good quality olive oil for this. Not only will it give the ice cream a rich, fruity flavour, it also helps to yield a smoother set. Serve with flakes of Maldon sea salt.

Serves 4

250ml full fat milk

3 egg yolks

50g caster sugar

150ml double cream

Pinch of salt

2-3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

1 Heat the milk on the hob until scalding. While it warms, whisk the yolks and sugar in a large bowl. Once the milk is hot, slowly pour it into the yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Pour back into the pan and stir over a low heat (don't take your eye off it for even a minute) until it's thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. It ought to at least reach the consistency of double cream. Don't let the custard boil or it'll curdle. Once thickened, add the double cream and salt, then whisk in the olive oil, to taste. Leave to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for an hour or so, once cool.

2 Decant the chilled mixture either into an ice-cream maker (following the manufacturer's instructions, if so) or into a large, lidded tub. Place the tub in the freezer for 30 minutes, then give the mixture a vigorous stir with a fork or whisk to break up any ice crystals. Return to the freezer for a further 30 minutes, and repeat. Keep stirring at intervals until the mixture is very thick and slushy, then leave to freeze, undisturbed, until completely set. You might want to give the ice cream 10 minutes in the fridge to soften slightly before serving.",How to bake with olive oil,http://www.theguardian.com,[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/5/1401970833899/ruby-bakes-olive-oil-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=a28f3ebec446078dfd630594dcdaf306,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/14/how-to-bake-with-olive-oil-ruby-tandoh-recipe
923,"After decades of neglect, when it was dismissed as little better than cattle fodder, this leafy brassica is back in fashion

Kale is not just delicious; it's good for you. If you don't trust WebMD (which calls it ""one of the healthiest vegetables on the planet""), or discoverkale.co.uk (""Kale truly is super""), then listen to Gwyneth Paltrow. ""Kale is full of calcium and antioxidants and just about everything else,"" the actor-cum-lifestyle-guru-cum-amateur-nutritrionist wrote in this very newspaper last year. ""When juiced with a bit of lemon, apple and ginger and a tiny hit of refreshing mint, it turns into a sort of grassy lemonade.""

Grassy lemonade, eh? Mmmmmm… If, for some reason, that idea doesn't appeal, then there's loads of alternative use for this so-called superfood. After decades of neglect, when it was dismissed as little better than cattle fodder, this leafy brassica is back in fashion on both sides of the Atlantic. If you don't fancy Annie Somerville's kale crisps, Jack Monroe makes pesto with kale, while Hugh Fearnley-Thingummy shreds it on to pizza and stir-fries it with beef and cashews. And if you want to give Gwynnie another chance, she has an interesting recipe for an almond and kale smoothie…

With a little planning, you can be harvesting kale for most of the year. For young leaves in summer and autumn, sow seeds from early spring to early summer, 15-20cm apart in moist but firm soil, ideally enriched with compost a few months before. A sunny spot is best, but kale can stand shade better than most vegetables. Start harvesting three to four months later – whole plants once they are 15cm high, or a leaf here and there once the plants reach 25cm. Make sure you don't strip too many from any single plant, and favour the tender inner leaves over the tougher ones that surround them.

For larger specimens to see you through winter and spring, sow seeds into trays or modules in mid- to late spring, then move the plants into their final positions in early to mid-summer. Set them 50cm or so apart, depending on the variety. You should be able to start picking leaves from late autumn.

Tall kales may need to be staked in winter, but don't worry too much about cold. They can survive down to -15C before bouncing back in spring, when the new shoots will help fill the notorious ""vegetable gap"". Frost actually improves their flavour, by encouraging the plant to turn its starches into sugar.

925,"The first indication Roz Chast had that her elderly parents weren't coping was when she noticed the level of grime in their apartment. Not ordinary dirt, she writes, in Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?, a graphic memoir of the decline and eventual death of her parents, but ""a coating that happens when people haven't cleaned in a really long time. It covered everything.""

In her professional life, Chast, 59, was a highly successful cartoonist for the New Yorker, at the top of her career and in control of an orderly life in leafy Connecticut. The moment she stepped into her parents' tiny apartment in Brooklyn, however – site of her unhappy childhood and where they had lived since 1959 without, apparently, throwing a single item away – she was transported back into a raging and impotent teen, ""filled with dread, guilt and a weird kind of claustrophobia"".

Those who know and love Chast's work think of her as the queen of family angst, a brilliant chronicler of domestic strife, and the account of her parents' last year – as they move from the apartment, to hospital, to a care home in Connecticut – is an extraordinary record of the love, fury and ambivalence that often characterises these experiences.

""Of course, there's always someone who writes in to say, 'I found it cruel,'"" she says. ""But mostly people are glad that I've said it was really hard, and really messy. I wanted to write about the entire experience, including the parts that were gross, and funny, and including my mixed feelings about my parents. I didn't want to write with a fake, rosy glow.""

We are in the kitchen of Chast's house, overlooking her garden. She works in a sunroom, surrounded by artwork, or in an armchair in the living room, where one of her two pet parrots sometimes perches on her shoulder. (The sofa is pecked bald in places, as is the parrot, who has an anxiety disorder and plucks his own feathers, a detail so apt as to seem taken from one of Chast's own cartoons.) The biggest problem, she says, was getting her parents to face up to the fact that they were sliding into chaos. This was not a family that talked about things, certainly not about death, or money, or intimacy, except in the most general and apocalyptic terms.

George, Chast's father, was terminally anxious, while her mother, Elizabeth – ""built like a fire hydrant"" and with a personality to match – ruled the home with an iron will. ""Her emotions were very primary colours,"" says Chast. ""When she was angry, she was really angry. And if she felt sad, she would just be sad."" She took her job as an assistant school principal extremely seriously and had no time for what she saw as the soppy self-indulgence of her husband's approach to things. ""My father was the introspective one. And she would yell at him, 'George, you're walking around with your feelers out!' Well, yeah, that's what we do as people on earth. We're not all made of metal.""

Roz Chast explores her relationship with her parents in her graphic memoir. Photograph: Roz Chast

They were an odd pair, utterly devoted to each other and not like other parents: ""My mother quoted Shakespeare and used words like 'interstices'. 'The dust will get into the interstices!' Or 'metatarsal'. Most of my friends' parents did not use that kind of language."" They were also remote from Chast, not particularly nurturing, and very much parents, not friends. When she visited their apartment that time and noticed the grime, she hadn't set foot in the place for 11 years. ""Aren't I the worst daughter?"" (They visited her a few times a year in Connecticut.) On some instinct, however, she drove to Brooklyn that day and saw that they were in trouble. As she writes ominously in the book: ""Something was coming down the pike.""

George and Elizabeth Chast had saved all their lives. They didn't have a mortgage, not trusting the banks and believing that borrowing money was wrong. They made do and mended, even patching up an old oven glove to make it go the distance. They were classic products of the Depression. And so, when Chast's mother injured herself in a fall and her father started showing signs of dementia, Chast moved them to a care home near her house, where the contrast in weekly expenditure was so horrifying, she says, you could only laugh.

It was a terrible time. The Chasts had medical insurance, but, incredibly, it wouldn't transfer from New York to Connecticut. And so they were thrown into a world of almost unthinkable financial burden. ""To go from a patched oven mitt and a washcloth full of soap slivers, to $14,000 a month?"" says Chast. ""You have to look at it as a black comedy. Scrimp and save, scrimp and save, and then it it all goes to Sunset Acres in two years, at the end of your life.""

Chast did all the things one has to do; she put them somewhere decent and clean. She got them a lawyer and, despite their horror of such things, forced them to sit down and talk about their finances. As they inched into their late 90s, she arranged for round-the-clock care. And she kept a horrified eye on their dwindling savings, all the while thinking: ""There goes my inheritance.

""It's a terrible, terrible thing and you look at yourself in the mirror and think: I'm a worm. I'm a lowly, shitty, crappy, horrible worm to be thinking about this. But everyone does think about it. Because you want to be able to leave some money for your kids.""

What she inherited, instead, was a world of junk. As her parents lay dying, Chast dragged herself back to their apartment and started the grim task of sifting through a lifetime of worthless possessions. ""You would open a drawer, which my father had jammed full of newspapers, and the bottom would drop out. There were buttons and screws and nails and bottle caps and jar lids – the drawer of jar lids! Why? Because they're made of metal and maybe there'll be another war and we'll need the metal. A friend of mine – I quote him in the book – says, 'You have found the source of the river eBay.'""

Her father died first, aged 95, and as Chast's relationship with him had been closer, she was less riven by guilt than she was during her mother's last days. The most painful part of the book is when she tries, at the 11th hour, to ask her mother if she regrets the fact that they hadn't been closer.

""That was bad. She sort of shut it down. She didn't really want to talk about it. It was too late. I think that's when I started to realise that you don't always get what you want. You don't get closure, or understanding. It just doesn't always happen.""

Chast had done right by them, but she was still sick with regret after they were gone. ""Should I have taken them into my house? Should I have seen them more? Why didn't I love them more? You know? Am I a disgusting person? I mean, I really loved my dad, but is there something that I'm missing here, in all this?""

The final sketches of her mother on her death bed are terribly poignant and, despite the sometimes lacerating honesty of the book, the impression one takes away from it is tenderness: the tenderness of a story truthfully told, and to that extent, a fine tribute to her parents. Their deaths made Chast look at her own two children, both in their 20s and with whom she has great relationships, and ""feel so sorry for my mother. That she missed out on something that to me is the most important thing in my life.""

In the wake of publication, people have written to Chast to ask for advice on how to deal with their own super-elderly parents, and she is at a loss as to what to say. That people live too long? That it is absurd to spend so much on sustaining lives it is hard to see the value in? At the end of the day, there are no profound insights; just horror, and sadness, and grim amusement. ""It was not something that I wanted to be doing,"" she says. ""But I had to do it.""

929,"In PJ O'Rourke's seminal essay, ""How to drive fast on drugs while getting your wing-wang squeezed and not spill your drink"" he imagined, aged 32, what it might be like to avoid the obvious temptations of a James-Dean-style exit (""no ulcers, no haemorrhoids, no bulging waistlines, no soft dicks or false teeth""), and get old.

He imagined, that is, falling for the mythical teenage lovely in the passenger seat of the mythical Pontiac Trans Am of fleeting youth and, before you even knew it, being ""married and having teenage lovelies of your own, plus a six-figure mortgage, a liver the size of the Bronx and a Country Squire station wagon that's never seen the sweet side of sixty"". And he imagined, when old, having to face this particular truth: ""that if you'd had just a little more courage, just a little more strength of character, you could have been dead by now. No such luck.""

O'Rourke is now 66. He is married with three children, the elder two in their teens. He has survived cancer (which began, six years ago, with some irony, in a malignant haemorrhoid – ""what colour of bracelet should one wear for that?"" he wondered ""And what slogan is apropos?"") as well as more than a few brushes with mortality as a roving war correspondent. He has, in the years since he wrote that essay, published 17 books and accumulated more entries in the Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations than any other living writer.

I have no news to report on the size of his liver, other than that the first thing he says, when we meet in the upstairs dining room of the Newman St Tavern, an ambitious gastropub in Fitzrovia, London, is that he is, strictly, drinking only mineral water. He has a heavy afternoon ahead, an on-air date with Adam Boulton of Sky TV (for which, I argue, strong liquor might prove a necessity), but he is also travelling with his 13-year-old daughter, on a tour to promote his new book, The Baby Boom: How it got that way … And it wasn't my fault … And I'll never do it again and on his best behaviour.

He wouldn't say he has mellowed exactly though the second thing he tells me, in some interested detail, is that these days he keeps chickens. The prompt for this admission is the presence on the menu of a single gull's egg as an appetiser, a challenge O'Rourke finds it hard to resist. ""I have often wondered what seagulls were good for,"" he suggests. ""Maybe this will provide the answer.""

He hopes the delicacy may also further a particular scientific inquiry he has pursued in recent years with his Rhode Island Red hens, at his home in New Hampshire. ""I have been trying to determine if you can change the taste of the egg depending on what you feed them,"" he says. Sometimes he gives his brood a whole bunch of onions or whatever; he is, in the manner of Heston Blumenthal, hoping to work up to a full in-egg English breakfast. So far, however, he has detected no difference in taste whatsoever.

He studies the menu with glum amusement. ""I come from Toledo, Ohio,"" he reminds me. ""We didn't often see 'ajo blanco' there, or 'lava toast, lardo', whatever that might be. Restaurant menus have become another intelligence test at which I fail.""

If O'Rourke has a default position as a writer, it is the natural conservative one of things now not being quite as much fun as they recently were. His new book, in which he adopts the ""we"" of the baby boomers, spokesman for the 72 million lucky Americans born between 1946 and 1964, too late for the Depression and the war, early enough for revolutions both sexual and digital, gives him plenty of scope for such reflection. It is perhaps the closest he will come to an autobiography, albeit one in which he peddles the boomers' greatest achievement, ""which has been in the field of bullshit"".

One of the luckiest things about his generation, he observes, was that the double bind he identified in his ""live fast die young"" reverie no longer applied: boomers arranged things so you didn't have to get old, you could be a perpetual adolescent. This was particularly the case if you avoided, as he and most of his friends did, the Vietnam draft. ""I didn't serve,"" he says. ""There were seven kids who I knew from high school and college who were killed. But I have never had any veteran say anything to me other than, 'you were well out of it'. It is not one of those things where anyone will ask: 'What did you do in the war Daddy?'""

In some ways, O'Rourke made up for it later. Though he'd never admit it, his life since his 20s, when he gave up on being a hippy and his parents died, has been one of pretty indefatigable service to his profession. For a couple of decades, there was no ""trouble spot"" in the world to which he could not be dispatched in search of absurdity.

That chapter of his life came to an end after the Iraq war when he was working with Mike Kelly, his friend and editor at Atlantic Monthly. They divided up duties and Kelly, embedded with an advanced battalion, was killed in fighting near Baghdad. ""I had a phone call to make that I never want to have to make again,"" O'Rourke recalls. ""I had to phone my wife to say not only that our close friend was dead, but also that I was going into Baghdad to replace him. My wife is the daughter of a career FBI agent, she says that until she was 13 she thought all men carried a gun to work. She said: 'If you feel it is important …' And I did, but that was about the end of it.""

The older one gets, he suggests, the gladder one gets that one doesn't have to make decisions. Any decisions. ""That is the really great thing about being an adult male, once you get married and have children the whole decision-making process is taken out of your hands, and I for one am extremely grateful.""

He eyes his gull's egg in its little cup suspiciously. ""One isn't quite sure how to approach this thing …"" Perhaps you have to sit on it for a couple of weeks, I suggest.

O'Rourke is glad to have got out of war reporting when he did. ""Now you are out there competing with every wannabe journalist with an iPhone and a blog,"" he says. He is relieved, too, that he has avoided the journalistic era in which the only question that matters is ""how does it feel?"" to have had your home/life/world destroyed. ""I mean,"" he says, ""how the fuck do you think it feels?""

On cue, I ask how it has felt to have come to parenting relatively late in life.

He tucks into his main-course cottage pie, one of the few incontrovertible items on the menu. ""I was 50,"" he says. ""The good thing about being an older parent is that you don't feel like your life is interrupted. You are not trying to take the baby out to cocktail parties; rather it is great to have an excuse not to got to cocktail parties. On the downside, retirement doesn't look like an option.""

Among the things I enjoyed about his book, I suggest, was the way it conveyed that sense of how as teenagers we have hardly any curiosity at all about the lives of our parents. I wonder what his daughter is making of her trip to London with her old man? ""I think she is sort of excited by the idea that Dad is in front of microphone or a camera. But of course what I am actually banging on about she properly has not the vaguest interest …""

Some things don't change down the years. The awkwardness of 16-year-old boys, say. His eldest daughter brought one home recently to meet the parents. ""It was rather touching, that fear,"" he says. ""I mean I have never had that effect on anyone. It's like: 'Should Dad pick this moment to be cleaning his shotgun?'""

O'Rourke has made a fine career out of being a scourge of the politically correct, without many of the usual trappings of that position. Bitterness or outrage, for example. He's getting ready to get off to the Sky studios when I ask him how he has managed to avoid becoming a curmudgeon.

""I have always had a sense that both angry and humorous is a trial to the reader,"" he says. ""I have tried to keep in mind the example of Mark Twain. If you love Mark Twain you are best advised to avoid the later essays: he had lost his wife, his money, his beloved daughter, and it all came out in the writing and it just doesn't read well. The trick is,"" he says, of getting old, ""you just have to keep finding things funny.""

As my beans rarely make it any further than a salad, this week has been an education for me – as a lazy cook, I was particularly pleased to discover how delicious they are whole, and I've earmarked contadina's supremely comforting Puglian dried bean mash for when the fresh variety are but a happy memory.

But, in mid-June, you can't get much more seasonal, or much more delicious than foodwithmustard's colourful broad bean, watercress and crab toast – the perfect Saturday lunch.

This recipe is inspired by one of my favourite dishes at Wallfish Bistro, a lovely neighbourhood eatery in Bristol's Clifton Village – my version has a bit more pepper and smoke.

Serves 4

4 slices of day-old sourdough bread

Handful of watercress or lovage leaves, plus extra to serve

400g fresh or frozen podded broad beans

300g cooked white crab meat

For the mayonnaise

1 large egg yolk

200ml rapeseed oil (or oil of your choice)

½ tsp lemon juice

1 tsp mustard powder

¾ tsp smoked paprika

2 tsp cooked brown crab meat

Salt, to taste

1 Toast the bread, then set it to one side to cool.

2 Boil the beans in a large pan of water until just tender; fresh beans require 3-4 minutes, frozen will take a little longer. Drain and allow to cool before shelling and crushing coarsely with a fork. Roughly chop the watercress or lovage and mix with the beans.

3 Put the egg yolk in a large mixing bowl and gradually beat in the rapeseed oil, incorporating it thoroughly each time before adding any more, until you have mayonnaise. Add the lemon juice, mustard powder and smoked paprika, followed by the brown crab meat. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.

4 Spoon the broad bean mixture on to the toasts and top with white crab meat and a generous dollop of mayonnaise. Serve with some extra snippets of watercress or lovage on the side.

This is a Persian Sephardi Jewish family dish that is usually served at Passover to celebrate the wonderful crops that arrive in the spring, among them the broad bean and a host of wonderful herbs. Try it, it's special.

Sarah Joseph and Ruth Nathan, veggischmooze.blogspot.com, via Guardian Witness

Serves 4-6

¼ tsp salt

175g basmati or mix with wild rice

½ tbsp oil

10g parsley,chopped

10g coriander, chopped

5g dill, chopped

10g mint, chopped

⅛ tsp turmeric

Pinch of cinnamon

Freshly ground pepper, to taste

2 tbsp vegetable stock

150g podded broad beans

1 Bring 1 litre water to the boil in a large pan, add the salt, then the rice. Cook for 10 minutes until translucent, but still with some bite. Drain and rinse with cold water.

2 Heat the oil in a wide, shallow, lidded pan and fry the herbs and spices for a minute or so. Stir in the damp rice, the stock and the beans if using older, larger ones. Cover securely and cook gently for 30 minutes. A crust should form on the base. This is called tahdig and is a delicacy.

3 If using young beans, cook these separately for a few minutes in boiling salted water. Peel and serve on top of the rice mixture, straight out of the pan.

Broad bean dip with pecorino

Broad beans are a naturally smooth and sweet complement to the nutty pecorino and refreshing lemon thyme.

TwinnyDip, twinnydip.blogspot.co.uk, via Guardian Witness

Makes 1 large bowl

400g frozen broad beans

2-3 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed

2 tbsp almond butter

A few sprigs of lemon thyme, leaves only

Zest and juice of ½ a lemon

1-2 tbsp olive oil

½ tsp paprika

75g pecorino, grated

Salt and black pepper, to taste

1 Cook the beans and garlic in boiling water for about 7 minutes, or until tender. Plunge into cold water to prevent further cooking. Drain, cool, and pop the beans out of their skins.

2 Put the cooked beans and garlic in a blender with the remaining ingredients and whizz until smooth. Add more lemon juice, olive oil, salt or pepper if necessary.

3 Spoon into a bowl, drizzle extra olive oil over the top, and decorate with extra cheese or thyme leaves if desired.

Chicken printanier

It's early summer and time to unleash your inner hunter-gatherer: which in my case means a trip to the local PYO. My dish celebrates all its lovely legumes, combined with chicken, cream, mustard and vermouth; a taste of spring, as the name suggests.

leftoverliz, lizsleftovers.blogspot.co.uk, via Guardian Witness

Serves 4-6

2 tbsp olive oil

1 chicken or 2 rabbits, jointed (or 2 chicken pieces per person)

500g broad bean pods or 300g podded beans

100g fresh or frozen peas

1 bunch of asparagus

1 glass of dry vermouth

1 tbsp wholegrain mustard

100-150ml creme fraiche

1 Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan and brown the meat in batches. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5.

2 Place the meat in an ovenproof dish and bake for 45 mins or so. Keep the frying pan to one side. Pod the beans if necessary.

3 Boil the podded beans in their skins for 10-15 minutes, with the peas and the asparagus placed in a steamer above the boiling water, then drain the beans and quickly slip them out of their leathery skins. Keep the vegetables warm in the oven whilst you make the sauce.

4 Heat the frying pan back up and deglaze with the dry vermouth, stirring to clean the bottom. As it bubbles, stir in the mustard and creme fraiche to make a thin sauce.

5 Pour the cream sauce over the chicken. Season and mix in the beans and peas. Lay the steamed asparagus over the top and serve.

Luisa's Spanish broad beans

So many modern broad bean recipes involve removing the pods and outer skins. This one, from my Spanish godmother Luisa, uses pretty much the whole thing, but you do need very young pods, no longer than 10-12cm, which makes it perfect for garden gluts. It's easy to make and absolutely stunning as a topping for bruschetta, as tapas or as a vegetable side dish.

JennyB

Serves 4, as part of a mixed tapas meal

500g young broad beans, in their pods

2 tbsp olive oil

½ onion, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

75-100g cured Spanish ham, in small dice

2 tbsp fino (dry) sherry

4 tbsp water

Salt and black pepper, to taste

1 tbsp breadcrumbs from day-old crusty bread

½ tbsp chopped parsley

1 hard-boiled egg, roughly chopped

1 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Top and tail the broad bean pods, and remove the stringy bits down the side. Chop into bean-size pieces.

2 Fry the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft, but not coloured. Add the beans, ham, sherry and water with a good pinch of both salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook in the oven for an hour, at which point the beans will be tender.

3 Stir in the breadcrumbs and parsley, check the seasoning, sprinkle with the egg and serve.

Pure di fave e cicoria (Dried broad beans with bitter greens)

This dish from Puglia, Italy, relies on the contrast between bitter greens and sweet, nutty beans. Photograph: contadina/Guardian Witness

If you don't do bitter greens, this works just as well with peperonata (stewed peppers with onion and tomato). The bitterness of the greens and the sweetness of the peppers both cut through the creamy nuttiness of the beans perfectly. Embellishments are optional and include red onions marinated in vinegar, bread chunks, fried or pickled green peppers, fried black or green olives, and whatever else you fancy (a spoonful of Branston pickle works well). Leftovers get reheated for breakfast with an egg on top.

contadina via Guardian Witness

Serves 4

500g dried broad beans, soaked overnight

2 large potatoes, peeled and chopped

1 onion, peeled but left whole

Large bunch of wild chicory, or a mixture of dandelion, rocket or chard

Olive oil, to taste

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped (optional)

1 Shell the soaked beans and boil for around half an hour (or cook for 8 minutes in a pressure cooker).

2 Drain and add the potatoes and onion to the pan before returning the beans. Salt and cover with water – not too much, mind, as you don't want a watery mix and you can always add more if required. Cook until the beans are soft and the potatoes disintegrate.

3 Meanwhile, wash the chicory or other greens, trim any tough stalks and steam or braise for about 20 minutes or until very tender – it's a good idea to change the water midway though cooking to leave just a hint of bitterness. Alternatively, wash the chicory really well before sauteeing with garlic in olive oil.

4 Discard the onion and puree the beans with a vegetable mill, potato masher or ricer. Season with salt and lashings of good green olive oil.

933,"'I don't think you're allowed to drink on the bus,' I tell my wife. 'Oh shut up,' she says. 'Come on'

My wife and I are running for the bus, on our way to a 50th birthday party in Oxford. I get there ahead of her, just before the doors close. Panting, we take our seats as the bus lurches into standstill traffic.

""We're never going to get there,"" my wife says.

There is worse to come: there has been an accident outside Oxford, and the police have closed the A40. The driver announces that we're being diverted through somewhere.

""Southampton?"" my wife asks. ""Did he just say Southampton?""

""I don't think so,"" I say. ""That would be the long way round.""

My wife is not satisfied with this, and turns to the man across the aisle. ""Did he say Southampton?"" she asks.

The man smiles politely.

The diversion takes us to the edge of Oxford, whereupon the bus turns and heads back towards London. ""Where are we going now?"" my wife shouts.

""To the stop before,"" I say. ""The park and ride.""

""Why are we doing that?"" she asks.

""Because people have left their cars there,"" I say.

Again, she is not satisfied. She tries to enlist the man opposite, and the man seated behind him, in a mutiny. They are sympathetic, but reluctant to commit. This, it turns out, is because they're both getting off at the park and ride.

""Look at you,"" she says as they stand up. ""With your cars. Where's my lift?""

We're only an hour late to the party, but we have to leave a bit early to catch the bus home. My wife recruits two fellow passengers, both women, from among the guests, so she can continue to laugh and gossip and, she hopes, drink. ""They're coming back with us,"" she tells me. ""We need to get some wine.""

""I don't think you're allowed to drink on the bus,"" I say.

""Oh shut up,"" she says. ""Come on.""

It's just gone midnight; the first bar we enter has stopped serving. I stand back as the three women move from negotiation to pleading to bribery.

""I can't,"" says the woman behind the bar. ""We're on CCTV.""

As they make their way from pub to pub, I fall farther behind. By the time I catch them up, they have secured an open bottle of white wine and four glasses. ""Where did you get those?"" I ask.

""Don't ask questions,"" my wife says. ""Just keep walking.""

The bottle is propped upright in a holdall and covered with a scarf. When we reach the high street, we can see our bus, poised to depart. Once again, we are obliged to run.

The top deck of the bus is sparsely populated and silent; most of the other passengers appear to be asleep. As we take seats at the back, the interior lights are dimmed.

""Not the atmosphere I was expecting,"" our friend says. ""Never mind.""

""Uh-oh,"" my wife says, extracting an empty, upside down wine bottle from the holdall.

""Oh no!"" our other friend says.

""Amazingly,"" my wife says, ""it landed in the glasses."" She proceeds to pull four full glasses from the bag in succession. It's like a magic trick.

""How lucky,"" the first friend says. ""Cheers.""

Only later do I realise my wife had just scooped the sloshing wine from the bottom of the holdall, dodging two floating lipsticks and a banana. I take a cautious sip from my cloudy glass and listen as the three of them gossip about other party guests, their conversation occasionally punctuated by merry shrieks.

""Perhaps we're being a bit loud,"" my wife says suddenly. We look down the aisle of the bus, at the heads lolling in the dark.

""Don't worry,"" the second friend says. ""Everyone's interested.""","Tim Dowling: wine, women and a late-night bus journey",http://www.theguardian.com,[Tim Dowling],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/11/1402483595400/Tim-Dowling-illo-14-June--009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=06f35a7efce9f2414b9bd59159bda884,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/14/tim-dowling-wine-late-night-bus-journey
935,"One of my earliest memories is of blackcurrant picking on the farm of a family friend in Tiverton, Devon, aged about three. Swishing the leaves and releasing a cloud of the white, acid-drop fragrance, which is so different to the fruit. If you are lucky enough to grow blackcurrants, adding a few leaves to the custard base of this recipe elevates it to another level.

Makes 10 scoops

blackcurrants 300g

large blackcurrant leaves (optional) 5-6, washed

whole milk 250ml

double cream 250ml

salt a pinch

golden granulated sugar 160g

egg yolks 3

lemon juice of ½, freshly squeezed

Heat the milk, cream and salt. As it reaches simmering point, stir in the leaves to submerge, turn off heat, cover pan with clingfilm and leave to infuse for half hour.

Cook the berries very gently with two tablespoons of water until tender. Cool completely then puree until very smooth. Sieve to remove the pips. Chill.

Strain the now perfumed milk and cream mixture into a clean pan; bring to a simmer once again. As the milk heats, whisk sugar into egg yolks. As soon as the milk breaks a simmer, pour a little into the egg yolk mix (this is called ""tempering"" the eggs) then return all to pan. Cook to 82C.

Cool in an ice-water bath. Once entirely cold, chill in refrigerator overnight or for at least 8 hours. The following day blitz custard with currant puree and the freshly squeezed lemon juice.

Churn in an ice-cream machine for 35 mins or until the ice-cream looks ""dry"". If you don't have a machine, freeze the mixture in a really big bowl. Every 90 minutes, take it out and whisk (or Magimix) vigorously. Do this three times, until smooth.

Scrape into a lidded freezer box, cover with waxed paper to reduce exposure to air and freeze to harden.

Delicious served with crisp vanilla scented Langues de Chat biscuits (from supermarkets or online retailers such as the Cheese and Wine Shop).

937,"The modest subtitle of Honey & Co's debut cookbook, Food from the Middle East, published this month, doesn't begin to capture the richness and variety of the recipes – sardines cured in vine leaves, oxtail sofrito, their celebrated feta and honey cheesecake. But it's not just about the superb dishes: the book also captures a sense of place, bottling the personality of the tiny, 10-table restaurant on London's Warren Street that won last year's Observer Food Monthly award for best newcomer. ""It was surprising to us how much it developed into a community rather than a workplace,"" says Sarit Packer, who co-owns Honey & Co with her husband Itamar Srulovich.

More than anything, Honey & Co is about Sarit and Itamar, their warmth and humour and skill, as well as the deep love of food that drew them together. They met 10 years ago when Itamar started working at a Tel Aviv restaurant where Sarit was sous chef. She was the organised one (""a war machine with a Bolshevik work ethic,"" in his words), whereas Itamar was a bit of a dreamer. Was he a good employee?

""He was horrible!"" she says. ""Always late. Messy beyond redemption. He was a beach bum with an occasional job."" According to Sarit, it wasn't immediately obvious they were going to be a couple. ""It took us a while,"" agrees Itamar, ""but she makes a very bad first impression – she's very standoffish.""

""Very professional, I prefer to call it,"" says Sarit.

Their relationship saw them through a decade's graft in London kitchens (including the Oxo Tower and Ottolenghi) and then the much greater stress of opening their own place. The book was written during the restaurant's first 12 months of business, a period they say was chaotic. There will be a follow-up, focusing on baking and patisserie, and Itamar has a long-standing dream of opening a kebab restaurant. But there will, they say, be only one Honey & Co. ""It would be nice if this place becomes an institution,"" Itamar says. ""Just somewhere that people will come back to again and again, for years to come,"" says Sarit, completing his thought.

Badargani



Aubergine rolls filled with walnuts and pomegranate, which you can serve as a starter if you want, or as a main with some yoghurt and a large green salad.

Dinner for 4

aubergines 4 large, trimmed

olive oil for brushing and drizzling

sea salt

freshly ground black pepper

For the filling

red onion 1 large (about 150g)

olive oil 3 tbsp

salt ½ tsp

toasted walnuts 100g, roughly chopped (reserve 2 tbsp to garnish)

pomegranate molasses 2 tbsp

freshly ground black pepper ½ tsp

fresh ginger 5cm piece, peeled and grated

parsley 1 small bunch, chopped (about 15-20g)

fresh pomegranate seeds 100g (reserve 2 tbsp to garnish)

cayenne a pinch

Heat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7.

Slice each aubergine into five or six slices lengthways. Keep the outside slices for the filling and use the nice, long, inside slices for the rolls. Brush a baking tray with oil and place the nice inside slices flat on it. Drizzle with some more oil and season with sea salt and black pepper. Roast in the oven for 12 minutes, then turn the tray around to ensure the slices cook evenly. Roast for another 8-12 minutes until they are golden and soft. Set aside to cool.

While the slices are in the oven, peel the onion and dice finely. Cut the aubergine trimmings (the outside slices) into equal-size cubes. Fry the onion in the oil over a medium heat until it starts to soften, then add the diced aubergine and salt. Cook until the aubergine is very soft. Remove the pan from the stove and add the remaining ingredients. Mix well and season to taste.

Place a large spoonful of the filling at one end of each roasted aubergine slice and roll them into thick sausages. Place the filled aubergine rolls in an ovenproof serving dish. If you have a little filling left over, spread it around the edges of the dish. Place in the oven for 5 minutes to warm through before serving. Sprinkle the warmed rolls with the reserved walnuts and pomegranate seeds and serve 3 rolls per person.

Carrot and butternut fritters



Carrot and butternut fritters. Photograph: Jan Baldwin

The following recipes make about 25 small fritters: enough for 6-8 people as a generous mezze, or for 4 as a vegetarian main course with green salad and a dipping sauce. If you can't be bothered with the dipping sauce, thick natural yoghurt is a delicious alternative.

Serves 6-8 to share as a mezze

carrot 1 large, peeled (about 150g)

potato 1 medium, peeled (about 150g)

butternut squash ¼, peeled and deseeded (about 150g)

onion ½, peeled (about 60g)

salt ½ tsp + another ½ tsp salt

eggs 2

tarragon 6 sprigs, picked and roughly chopped

freshly ground black pepper ¼ tsp

ground cardamom pods ½ tsp

wholemeal flour 3 tbsp

baking powder ½ tsp

vegetable oil for frying

For the chive sour cream

sour cream 1 small tub (about 170ml)

chives ½ bunch, chopped finely

lemon juice 1 tsp

mayonnaise 1 tbsp

freshly ground black pepper

Grate all the vegetables on a coarse grater (or use a food processor) and place in a sieve over a bowl. Sprinkle with half a teaspoon of salt and mix lightly. Allow to sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature to draw out the excess water.

Place the eggs, tarragon, remaining half-teaspoon of salt, pepper, ground cardamom, flour and baking powder in a bowl. Squeeze out whatever liquid you can from the vegetables, add them to the bowl and mix vigorously to combine.

Heat about 2cm of oil in a frying pan, and line a plate with some absorbent kitchen paper. Scoop little spoonfuls of the batter into the oil and fry for about a minute until they start to crisp up. Flip the fritters carefully and fry on the other side for another minute or so till crisp. Remove to the lined plate to absorb the excess oil. Repeat until you have used all the batter.

Mix all the chive sour cream ingredients together (I wouldn't add any salt, as chives have a natural saltiness) and serve with the fritters.

Stuffed (wedded) sardines



Stuffed (wedded) sardines. Photograph: Jan Baldwin

Mediterranean sardines are delicious but tiny, barely a mouthful each. That could be why this dish was invented – two sardines glued together with a paste made of fish roe and herbs, and then fried. The result looks like a couple in coitus, hence the name ""wedded sardines"" (this is a dish from north Africa, where coitus means marriage). The sardines we get in this country are just as good but much bigger, so (sadly) there is no need to couple them; they remain single, but still delicious. Ask your fishmonger to butterfly the sardines, or you can do it yourself. If you haven't done it before, I'd suggest that you check online to see how – if I were to try to explain the process here, you would never try it, but it is truly simple.

Dinner for 4

sardines 8 medium-sized, butterflied

vegetable oil for frying

flour for coating

salt a pinch

black pepper a pinch, freshly ground

For the filling

coriander 1 small bunch (about 15-20g)

parsley 1 small bunch (about 15-20g)

garlic 1 clove

anchovy fillets 3 or 1 tbsp salted cod roe

For the potato salad

potatoes 1kg, peeled and diced

water 1.5 litres

salt

turmeric ¼ tsp

olive oil 2 tbsp

black pepper a pinch, freshly ground

garlic 2 cloves, peeled and crushed

lemon juice of ½ (about 1 tbsp)

capers small, 3 tbsp

parsley 3 tbsp, chopped

celery 2 sticks, finely chopped

For the tomato salsa

plum tomatoes 4, halved

olive oil 2 tbsp

salt a generous pinch

To make the filling, simply blitz all the ingredients together. Place a teaspoonful of the filling on the cut surface of each butterflied sardine, spread it all over and then close it up so it looks like a whole fish. Cover the sardines and place in the fridge till you are ready to fry them – this can be done up to a day in advance.

Place the diced potatoes in a large pan with the water, salt and turmeric and bring to the boil. Boil for 6-7 minutes, then check a cube to see whether a knife goes through it easily; if it does, quickly drain. Transfer the warm potatoes to a large mixing bowl, add the olive oil, pepper and crushed garlic, and carefully toss around to coat. Set aside for 15-20 minutes to cool, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Grate the tomatoes on a coarse grater until you are left with the empty skins. Discard the skins and season the tomato pulp with the olive oil and salt.

Heat a large pan containing 2cm of vegetable oil until very hot. Season some flour with salt and pepper and dip the sardines in it to give them a little coating – this helps the skin go lovely and crispy when fried. Drop a little pinch of flour into the oil to test the heat – it should fizz up immediately. Carefully place the sardines in the hot oil. Don't overfill the pan: it's better to cook these in batches and allow plenty of space for them to crisp up. Fry for 2 minutes on each side, then remove to a plate lined with some kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil.

Once the fish are all fried, sprinkle them very lightly with some sea salt and serve straight away with the potato salad and tomato salsa, preferably on a balcony overlooking the Med.

Lamb shawarma

Serves 6 as a big, fun-filled dinner

onions 4, peeled (about 500g)

ras el hanout spice mix 3 tbsp

salt 2 tsp

white pepper ½ tsp

shoulder of lamb 1, on the bone (about 1.8-2kg)

For the cabbage salad

salt ½ tsp

white cabbage ½, shredded (about 350g)

lemon juice of 1

parsley 1 small bunch, chopped (about 15-20g)

vegetable oil 2 tbsp

pomegranate seeds from 1 small (if you like)

Preheat your oven to 250C/gas mark 9. Puree the first 2 onions to a pulp in a food processor with the ras el hanout, salt and pepper. Slice the other 2 onions and lay them on the base of a deep roasting dish big enough to contain the lamb. Pat the pureed onion mixture all over the lamb, top and bottom, and lay it on the bed of onions.

Place the roasting dish uncovered in the upper-middle part of the very hot oven for 30 minutes. It should have started to colour and brown (it may take an extra 10 minutes if your oven doesn't run very hot).

Pour in enough water to reach halfway up the lamb joint and cover the dish. Lower the oven temperature to 200C/gas mark 6 and cook for 1 hour. Uncover, baste with the liquid at the bottom of the dish, then re-cover and return to the oven. Reduce the heat to 180C/gas mark 4 and cook for an hour. Baste again, re-cover and cook for a further hour. Basting is important as it will help to soften the lamb, so don't skip doing this. After 3½ hours the meat should be really soft and come away from the bone easily.

Sprinkle the salt on the shredded cabbage in a bowl, mix and allow to sit for 10-15 minutes until it starts to soften. Add the lemon juice, parsley and vegetable oil and mix well. If need be, add a touch more salt – it should be really sharp and lemony. Sprinkle with the pomegranate seeds if using.

Set your table with flatbread to soak up the juices, some yoghurt, a bowl of mint leaves to cool, pickled chillies if you want some heat and some cabbage salad for crunch. Bring the whole beautiful shoulder to the table and dish it out with a large spoon.

Yoghurt mousse with cherry and pomegranate granita

We use mahleb in this recipe, a bittersweet spice that complements the flavours so well; replace it with vanilla if you can't get hold of any. For the best results use a strained yoghurt – you can either buy it ready-strained (such as Total Greek yoghurt) or hang 500g of natural yoghurt in some cheesecloth over a bowl for 2 hours to yield 300g of strained. Make sure to start the granita at least a day in advance as it takes time to freeze, but once made it will keep in the freezer for two weeks.

Makes 4-6

For the cherry and pomegranate granita

pomegranates 2

cherries 250g

sugar 2 tbsp

boiling water 2 tbsp

lemon juice of ½ (1 tbsp)

orange juice of ½ (2 tbsp)

For the mousse

egg whites 2

honey 60g

strained yoghurt 300g

ground mahleb or vanilla 1 tsp

Crack one of the pomegranates open and remove 3-4 tbsp of the seeds to serve with the finished dessert later on.

Squeeze the juice out of the remainder of that pomegranate and the whole one; this is very easy – use a citrus press, or a home juicer or just press the pomegranates until all the little seeds explode and let out their juice.

Reserve about 12-14 cherries to use as garnish and stone the rest. Puree the stoned cherries with the pomegranate juice, sugar, water, lemon juice and orange juice. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl or plastic container and place in the freezer. Give the mixture an hour to start to freeze, then use a fork to smash it up. Return to the freezer and repeat 3-4 times until the juice is all frozen into lovely crystals.

Now for the mousse. Place the egg whites in a mixer bowl with a whisk attachment and whisk until they start to go white and fluffy. Heat the honey in a small pan till it boils, then pour into the whites in a steady drizzle. Continue whisking until the mixture forms a strong shiny meringue.

In a separate bowl mix the yoghurt and mahleb. Take a spoonful of the meringue and stir through to release the yoghurt a little, then carefully fold the rest of the meringue into the yoghurt. Spoon into a glass serving bowl, or individual dishes or glasses, and chill the mousse until ready to serve.

To serve, scoop the granita on to the yoghurt mousse and decorate with the reserved cherries and pomegranate seeds.

941,"There are some upsides to being a professional cyclist with alopecia, concedes Joanna Rowsell. While her team-mates of both genders are slaves to the razor, she almost never has to shave her legs. And while Laura Trott and Lizzie Armitstead struggle to fit their hair under their aero helmets, Rowsell's slips on to her bald head with ease.

But mostly, the 25-year-old says cheerfully, wearing a Rachel from Friends-ish wig the colour of maple syrup, she doesn't think about her alopecia much. ""Everyone does their hair in the morning. I put a wig on. That's just what I do. It's not something that enters my day-to-day thoughts. The more I get asked about it, the more I think maybe I should be worried about it, maybe I look awful.""

She doesn't, of course. She looks fighting fit, sitting in her GB tracksuit in the velodrome cafe in Manchester. She's back on form after missing the inaugural women's Tour of Britain in May with flu and is ready and raring for next month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Rowsell followed the women's Tour of Britain from her sickbed and was cheered to see so many people turn out to watch Holland's Marianne Vos power her way to victory. ""Before the race, people said to the organisers: 'You won't get big crowds, people only come for the men.' They really proved that wrong. Cycling is a very accessible sport; it can come past your house if you're lucky enough. You don't have to pay to go to a stadium.""

When the Tour de France rolls through Yorkshire next month, Rowsell plans to be by the roadside watching. She'll probably be up Cragg Vale, Britain's longest continual hill, a five-mile slog from Mytholmroyd, on one of her regular training routes. Rowsell loves the six days a week she spends training, especially riding in the hills near the home in Rochdale she shares with her boyfriend, trainee accountant Dan Shand. He once dreamed of getting paid to ride his bike and has no truck with her whingeing. ""Whenever I moan about it raining outside or having to get up early, he always tells me: 'Well, I'm up at 6.30 every morning and I have to sit in an office all day while you're out on your bike. You don't know how easy you've got it,'"" she says.

Dan isn't bothered about her alopecia and nor, it would seem, is she. But she concedes it was very hard when her hair first started to fall out, back when she was 10. ""I always had bald spots but over time it all started coming out in clumps,"" she recalls. ""People say I was brave to go on the podium in the Olympics with my bald head but I just wanted to get my medal. Really, the brave thing was learning to deal with it when I was young – going to my first training camp when nobody knew me or about my condition. That was brave.""

Alopecia is a general term used for hair loss; this can be anything from a small bald patch on the head to the loss of all the hair over the entire body. According to Alopecia UK, it affects approximately 1.7% of the population, and 25% of those affected have a family history of the condition. The exact cause is still not known, but it is generally agreed that it is a disease of the immune system, which attacks affected hair follicles by mistake. It doesn't affect the sufferer's physical health, though it can certainly cause psychological scars.

Rowsell has lost almost all her hair, hence not having to shave her legs and having to pencil in her eyebrows each morning. By the time she won gold in London aged 23, she had stopped obsessing over it and was surprised by the reaction her bald head caused. ""People would ask me: 'What would you say to young girls with it?' And I was a bit stumped, because I've made my peace with it.""

But she doesn't like people treating her wigs as fashion accessories: she remains unhappy about a photoshoot with a national newspaper post-Games, which got her to wear six different wigs with six different outfits. ""I like to look consistent, like me,"" she says.

Despite being softly spoken and certainly more of an introvert than Trott and some of her other team-mates, there is a steeliness to Rowsell. She doesn't react when anyone shouts sexist remarks at her when she's out on her bike, reasoning, she says, that ""I think I've made something of my life. It fires me up a bit.""

Of her alopecia, she says: ""I don't want it to define me, but some people do. Like putting on their Twitter profile: 'Alopecia sufferer.' I would never say that. I would never put: 'I'm an asthma sufferer,' or 'I've currently got flu.'"" Rowsell's Twitter bio currently reads: ""Olympic Champion cyclist London 2012. Current Double World Champion in Individual & Team Pursuit. World record holder. Chocoholic.""

""Since the Games I've met quite a few girls with the condition and I've been surprised by how badly people have handled it. They said they've been depressed, in hospital. I was shocked at that sort of thing. Anything I can do to make things better for people is great, even if it's them saying, when someone asks them what's wrong: 'Oh, I've got what Joanna Rowsell's got.' Of course it's very hard, especially at first, but you need to not let it define you.""

943,"Nigel Slater makes the most of the new season's strawberries, mangoes and rhubarb

Five easy desserts for summer that make the most of the season's perfect marriages from strawberries and cream and mango and lemon, to vanilla and caramel and rhubarb and custard.

Strawberries with saffron cream

Assemble at the last minute to keep a perfect contrast between the crisp biscuits and soft cream. I suspect this could be good with raspberries too

Serves 3-4

For the saffron cream

double cream 300ml

saffron 12 strands

icing sugar 2 tbsp

For the biscuits

butter 90g

icing sugar 90g

egg whites 2

plain flour 75g

vanilla extract 1 tsp

salt a pinch

flaked almonds a handful

strawberries 3-4 per person

Warm the cream and the saffron in a small saucepan, turning the heat off just before it reaches the boil, then set aside to cool. Transfer to the fridge.

Make the biscuits: set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Soften the butter in a small saucepan till it is just starting to melt. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the icing sugar, egg whites, flour, vanilla extract and a tiny pinch of salt, then stir in the softened butter. Place generous teaspoons of the mixture on lightly greased baking parchment or a floured baking sheet, scatter over the flaked almonds then cook for about 8 minutes till they have spread and are pale biscuit coloured. Remove from the oven and transfer with a palette knife.

When the cream is cold, strain it through a tea strainer or small sieve to remove the saffron threads, then whip to thick, soft mounds, but not so stiff it will stand in peaks. Gently fold in the 2 tbsp sifted icing sugar.

Hull and halve the strawberries. Drop them into the saffron cream, then crumble the biscuits and fold into the berries and cream. Serve within 15-20 minutes of mixing, otherwise your biscuits will become soggy.

Rhubarb custard tarts

Rather like those crisp Portuguese custard tarts, these little chaps are filled with rhubarb and vanilla bean custard.

Makes 12

rhubarb 2 short sticks

caster sugar 2-3 tbsp

orange juice of 1

puff pastry 300g

For the custard filling

milk 350ml

vanilla a pod

caster sugar 60g

egg yolks 3

cornflour 15g

Make the custard: pour the milk into a saucepan. Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, scrape out the seeds with the point of a knife then add them, together with the pod, to the milk. Bring to the boil, then immediately remove from the heat and leave the vanilla to infuse.

Beat together the caster sugar, egg yolks and cornflour, then pour in the milk and mix thoroughly, removing the empty vanilla pod. Wipe the saucepan, then pour in the custard and warm over a moderate heat, stirring almost continuously, till the sauce feels thick and heavy on the spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Chop the rhubarb into short, cork-length pieces, place them in a shallow pan, add the caster sugar and orange juice then leave to cook over a low heat for 10 minutes or until they are soft, but still hold their shape. If you prefer, you can bake them.

Roll out the pastry to a rectangle approximately 40cm in length and 30cm wide, turning it with the longest side towards you. Taking the right-hand edge, roll the pastry up to form a short, tight roll, then slice into 12 discs. Place each piece of pastry on the work surface and press or roll out, using a little flour if necessary, so they will neatly cover the base and sides of each of the buns tins.

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Line the bun tins with the pastry, then fill each with a square of greaseproof paper and baking beans or with a ball of crumpled kitchen foil and bake for 12-15 minutes till the pastry is dry and lightly crisp. Lower the oven heat to 160C/gas mark 3.

Remove the paper and beans or foil, fill each case with custard then add 2 or 3 pieces of cooked rhubarb to each. Return the tarts to the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes till the custard is lightly set. Remove from the heat, leave to settle for a few minutes then carefully remove from the tins with a palette knife, spoon a tablespoon of rhubarb syrup over each and leave to cool.

Salted caramel and panettone sundae

Sticky, salty and sweet. An indulgence of the first order.

Serves 2

For the sauce

light muscovado 50g

double cream 125ml

vanilla extract a few drops

sea salt flakes ½ to 1 tsp

For the toast

panettone 150g

vanilla ice-cream 2-4 balls

Make the caramel sauce: Put the sugar and cream in a small saucepan, add the vanilla extract and sea salt, and bring to the boil, then turn off and remove from the heat.

Cut the panettone into slices, then toast till lightly golden on both sides. Dip the panettone into the caramel sauce, then divide between two plates. Place a ball of ice-cream, or two if you wish, on each piece of toast, trickle over any caramel sauce that hasn't been soaked up by the panettone and serve.

Mango in muscat

This will leave you with half a half-bottle of chilled sweet wine: no bad thing. I like these served very cold with the friands below.

Serves 2-3

mangoes 2

moderately priced sweet muscat 2 glasses

Peel the mangoes and remove the flesh from the stone in the thickest pieces you can. Cut the flesh into large chunks and put in a freezer-proof container, even a zip-lock bag will do.

Pour the muscat in with the mango then put in the freezer for an hour or two till very cold, but not frozen. Serve with the poppy seed cakes below.

Poppy seed and lemon friands

You can also make smaller, thinner versions using Madeleine tins, which will yield 16 and require a slightly shorter cooking time. I took mine out at 9 minutes and they were perfect.

Makes 12

butter 180g

plain flour 50g

icing sugar 180g

ground almonds 100g

grated zest of a lemon

poppy seeds 3 tbsp

egg whites 5

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Lightly butter 12 shallow bun tins.

Melt the butter in a small pan and set aside. Sieve the flour and the icing sugar into a wide mixing bowl. Add the ground almonds and the lemon zest. Stir in the poppy seeds.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites till foamy. They should be quite sloppy and incapable of standing in peaks.

Shape a shallow well in the centre of the flour and sugar mixture then pour in the egg whites and the melted, but not hot, butter. Mix gently, making certain there are no floating pieces of egg white foam, then spoon into the buttered tins.

Bake for 12 minutes, remove from the oven, then leave to settle before carefully removing from the tins with a palette knife.",Nigel Slater's 5 early summer dessert recipes,http://www.theguardian.com,[Nigel Slater],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/11/1402497735371/Strawberries-with-saffron-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=759985dc70d4527b63108b45ad07c853,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/15/nigel-slater-5-summer-dessert-recipes
945,"It would begin with being sent into the garden to collect apple mint to cook with Jersey potatoes, my first happy summer holiday task, so it was probably going to be salmon they would accompany, a Saturday dish that would become a highlight all summer long. Then, to go with it, the cucumber slicing, the vinegar, the rarely used black-pepper mill, the pinch of sugar … and parsley sauce: green-flecked and silky smooth, that gorgeous lotion buried pink flakes of fish as swiftly as lava flow.

All this carry-on was giddy stuff to a boy who, quite simply, loved to eat. Later into the season it would be the neat shredding of our own runner beans through a hand-cranked contraption clamped to the edge of the kitchen table, so bright green and sappy as they tumbled into an enamelled tin dish (always the same one) as if by magic. Broad beans were homegrown, too. Although I adore these now, I truly loathed them as a boy.

Our attempts at growing new potatoes always seemed a dismal failure. However, marrows from the garden were a huge success – and with much emphasis on the huge. Once cut down to size, these vegetable leviathans emerged as a mellow oven dish, immersed in a simple white sauce to accompany a roast shoulder of lamb, all crisp of skin and sweet pink meat within. I just knew that these moments would always be the best of times.

Homegrown gooseberries and blackcurrants were picked through the warm months for making sugar-crusted pies. As were over-ripe strawberries bought for a few pence at the market, packed into pastry, which fought to contain their copious, fragrant juices as they seeped out on to a sheet of tinfoil placed on the oven floor of the Aga.

That sensible purpose, however, affords me yet another memory of those heady summer scents: that of scorched strawberry jam – which, of course, was nothing of the sort. Rhubarb emerged as rampantly as triffids under terracotta pots. Raspberries, sadly, offered a meagre crop.

That which flourished, however, was hugely celebrated during the hot and heady days of my childhood summertime and the resultant dishes a joy to devour. I do hope the following recipes will offer inspiration and enjoyment in your own kitchen too.

Broad beans à la Française (well, kind of)



Broad beans à la Française. Photograph: Jason Lowe for Observer Food Monthly

I have added a little bacon, which is something I would never contemplate adding to the traditional dish when made with peas. Many do, but I couldn't possibly comment. This particular outing used frozen broad beans.

Serves 4

frozen broad beans 650g

butter 50g

smoked streaky bacon 6 thin rashers sliced into very thin strips

spring onions 1 bunch, trimmed and cut into 2cm lengths

lettuce the outside leaves of 3-4, roughly sliced (see lettuce salad, below)

Maldon salt a little

freshly ground white pepper plenty

Place the frozen beans in a bowl and cover with boiling water from a kettle. Drain in a colander and then plunge into a bowl of iced water for a few minutes. Drain once more and remove their tiny skins – which will take a while, but vastly improve the finished dish, be assured. Take a large frying pan (preferably non-stick), melt the butter and stew the bacon in it over a medium heat until opaque, then add the spring onions and continue stewing for a further 5 minutes. Introduce the lettuce leaves and raise the heat. Once the liquid in the pan begins to emulsify, tip in the beans and seasoning, then cook the whole assembly for a further few minutes, tossing and turning it together with a sturdy spatula until all green and glossy. Tip out on to a hot serving dish and serve forthwith.

Oriental poached chicken in green chilli and coriander jelly

The cooking of the chicken, here, relies fully upon the Chinese recipe known as ""steeped chicken"". It is a superb method when dealing with a chicken that is intended to be served cold. I have offered two versions of the finished dish: one is elaborate and a bit cheffy; the other more homely and serviceable, though each uses exactly the same recipe. Try the former for a special, sunny lunch at home, and the latter for a picnic.

Serves 4

For cooking the chicken

chicken 1 (1.3-1.4kg)

Chinese shaoxing wine, or dry sherry 150ml

chicken stock 200ml, lightly flavoured

star anise 2

spring onions 1 bunch, trimmed and sliced into short lengths

garlic 4 cloves, crushed

ginger 75g, sliced

mild green chillies 3 large, sliced (I used jalapeños throughout)

Thai fish sauce 1 tbsp, plus a little extra as seasoning, if necessary

mild green chillies 3 large, deseeded and finely chopped

coriander 1 large bunch, roughly chopped

gelatine leaves 4, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes, until soft

You will also need a few extra green chillies and coriander leaves standing by, depending upon how you wish to finish the dish.

Choose a lidded cooking pot that will accommodate the chicken snugly, then remove the chicken and put to one side.

For cooking the chicken, add the remaining ingredients to the pot, bring up to a simmer and quietly cook for 10 minutes. Now, reintroduce the chicken, breast side up, and top up with boiling water from a kettle until it reaches just above the joint of the thigh and drumstick. Return to a simmer, skim off any scum that accumulates on the surface, then turn the chicken over. Allow to cook for 2 minutes, then switch off the heat. Put on the lid and leave be for 30 minutes.

Once the time is up, turn the chicken over once more and quietly return to a simmer. As it does, take a small sharp knife and make short slashes through the chicken skin between the leg and thigh, on each side, which will allow the bird to cook evenly. Once again, simmer for 2 minutes and then a further 30 minutes with the heat switched off, covered. Remove the bird from its broth, put on to a plate and allow to cool for about 20 minutes – or until cool enough to handle.

Carve both the breasts and legs from the chicken and put to one side. Using your hands, break up the chicken carcass into rough pieces and return to the broth. Bring up to a gentle simmer once more, then cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, so that the broth may reduce a little and intensify in flavour. Note: attentive removal of generated surface scum with spoon and ladle during this time will hugely contribute to the clarity of the finished broth.

Have the chopped green chillies and coriander leaves ready in a deep saucepan, together with the softened gelatine leaves. Suspend a colander over the pan, strain the broth through it and discard debris. Stir the broth through the flavourings and gelatine to distribute them, then allow to infuse for 30 minutes.

Finally – phew! – strain this infusion through a double layer of muslin into a clean bowl.

To finish the dish:

Cheffy method: Remove the skin from the chicken, cut into equal-size pieces and arrange in a serving dish. Decorate them with a few slices of chilli and some sprigs of coriander and place in the fridge to chill. Fill a large bowl with ice cubes, a tablespoonful of salt and enough cold water to just cover the ice cubes. Immerse the bowl filled with the infused stock into the watery ice and begin to gently stir it around. After several minutes you will to notice the liquid starting to gel. Once it begins to look syrupy lift the bowl from the ice. Now remove the chicken from the fridge and, with moderate speed, carefully ladle the jelly over the chicken pieces.

Return to the fridge until you are ready to present the dish.

Picnic method: As above, remove the skin from the chicken but, this time, remove the meat from the bones and cut into strips. Take the infused stock and mix it with one tablespoon of finely chopped, deseeded chillies and 2 tbsp of finely chopped coriander leaves, then tip in the chicken. Mix well and decant into a Tupperware container. Put on the lid and place in the fridge until set – about 3 hours.

A simply dressed rice salad – and mixed with peas, say – would be an excellent accompaniment to both versions of this fragrantly elegant dish.

Marinated mackerel with tartare dressing

Here, I have simply marinated the mackerel in a little salt and lemon juice, as the accompanying ""tartare"" dressing has a punch all its own.

Serves 4

mackerel 2 large, very fresh, filleted

lemons juice of 2

Maldon salt

cos lettuce 1 (using several leaves from the heart)

For the tartare dressing

egg yolk 1

extra virgin olive oil 2-3 tbsp

Dijon mustard 1 tsp

green peppercorns ½ tbsp

Worcestershire sauce a few shakes

Tabasco sauce 4-5 drops

cognac 2 tsp

chopped parsley 1 tbsp

small gherkins 3-4, chopped

capers 1 tsp

Maldon salt a little

Take the 4 mackerel fillets and run a very sharp knife either side of the central row of bones, so further cutting each into two thin strips. Place these in a suitable dish, sprinkle with enough sea salt simply to season them and squeeze over the lemon juice. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 3 hours, turning them over 2-3 times, until the fish is opaque and has firmed up.

To make the dressing, simply puree all the ingredients in a small processor until smooth. Drain the lemon juice from the fish and serve it with crisp leaves taken from the heart of a cos lettuce. Simply pop two or three slivers of the fish inside each leaf, anoint with dressing and eat with fingers. The contrast in texture is most agreeable.

Stuffed tomatoes with rice, anchovy and herbs

Based on a classic antipasto, these intensely savoury baked tomatoes are best eaten at room temperature.

Serves 4

tomatoes 8, medium-sized firm and ripe

garlic 4 cloves, peeled and crushed

dried chilli flakes ½ tsp

mint, parsley and basil leaves a small handful

extra virgin olive oil 100-125ml

anchovy fillets 8, finely chopped

carnaroli rice 65g

Maldon salt a little

Remove the cores from the tomatoes using a small, sharp-tipped knife, then turn them over. Using the same knife, cut across about a quarter of the way down the tomato to give 8 little caps, reserving these for later. Using a teaspoon, carefully scoop out all the tomato's innards into a food processor. Place the hollowed-out shells into a dish (or foil takeaway containers if for a picnic) that will accommodate them quite snugly. Add the garlic, chilli and herbs to the tomato innards and pulse/process until all is an even, but fairly coarse puree. Now pour in 100ml of olive oil and further process until the entire mixture is sloppy and oily. Tip into a bowl and add the anchovies, rice and a little sea salt; this will be necessary, even though the anchovies will season as well. Thoroughly stir everything together and leave to sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to an hour. Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

Using a dessertspoon, fill the tomatoes with the rice mixture (there may be a little left over so don't be tempted to over-fill), making sure that all the liquid is included, allowing any excess to flow into the dish. Replace the little caps on each tomato, trickle over a little more oil and bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, turning the heat down a touch if the tomatoes are browning too much – but they must blister somewhat, for both the taste and the look of the thing. Taste a little of the rice to make sure it is fully cooked, although it will also continue to swell as it cools. Serve at room temperature (or cool) well basted with the juices and oil just before serving.

Lettuce salad with eggs, mustard cress and a creamed dressing

When little round lettuces are at their very best and fresh as a daisy, would one truly wish for anything else?

Serves 4

For the dressing

mayonnaise 4 tbsp

milk 2-3 tbsp

Worcestershire sauce several generous shakes

lemon juice of 1 small

freshly ground white pepper

whipping cream 2-3 tbsp

eggs 4

round lettuces 4, ruthlessly trimmed of all dark-to-mid green outer leaves to reveal only a pale green/yellow heart (save the outer leaves for the broad bean recipe above)

mustard cress 4 punnets

chives 1 small bunch, snipped

extra virgin olive oil a little

Maldon salt

freshly ground black pepper

Whisk all the ingredients for the dressing together in a bowl until the consistency of pouring cream. Please use your own taste buds, here, as to a flavour that suits you; I prefer the dressing sharp-ish, and also like the Worcestershire sauce to be notable. Keep cool in the fridge until needed.

Take the eggs, place in a small pan and just cover with cold water. Bring up to a boil, switch off the heat and put on a lid. Leave in the water for exactly 5 minutes, then place the pan in the sink and allow a steady stream of cold water to run through the eggs for at least 3 minutes. Lift out the eggs, carefully shell them and slice on a plate using an egg slicer – one of my favourite bits of kitchen kit. If you don't have one, either slice with a knife or cut them into quarters.

Now, take the four lettuce hearts and separate into leaves. Arrange in a generously sized shallow dish so the leaves are as separate as possible; this will allow, all at once, for as much lateral distribution of the sliced eggs, a scattering of cress, the snipped chives and some dressing – the latter as a neat splatter – before mixing at table with the merest shine of oil and the faintest sprinkle of flaky salt and grind of pepper.

Chilled salmon, dill and cucumber soup

This cold soup has all the attributes of a perfect summer garden lunch: texturally exciting, fragrant, undeniably stylish.

Serves 4

cucumber 1 medium-sized

white wine 200ml

chicken stock 200ml, lightly flavoured

lemon juice of 1

dill about a dozen sprigs – 10, roughly chopped, 2 reserved for garnish

salt and pepper

spring onions 4, roughly chopped

white wine vinegar 1 tsp

tomato 1 medium, chopped

salmon fillet 200g, skinless and boneless

floury potato 1 medium, peeled and chopped small

double cream 125 ml

Tabasco 4-5 healthy shakes (optional)

Peel the cucumber and place the skin in a stainless steel pan. Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, scoop out the seeds and add them to the pan. Thinly slice the cucumber halves, place in a bowl and keep cool in the fridge. Pour in the white wine, chicken stock, lemon juice, dill, seasoning, spring onions, white wine vinegar and tomato. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl, then return it to the (rinsed clean) pan.

Slip in the salmon fillets, return the liquid to a simmer, switch off the heat, cover and leave the fish in the waning heat for 5 minutes. Fish out the fish, put on to a plate to cool then keep cold in the fridge. Now add the potato to the fishy broth and simmer to a point of collapse. Tip the contents of the pan into a liquidiser, process until very smooth and, once more, pass this through a fine sieve into a bowl. Allow to cool to room temperature, whisk in the cream, stir in the cucumber and Tabasco [if using], then add the leaves from the reserved dill, finely chopped. Chill thoroughly in the fridge for at least 3 hours.

To serve, flake the salmon into the middle of four chilled soup plates and ladle over the soup.

Gooseberry pie



Gooseberry pie. Photograph: Jason Lowe for Observer Food Monthly

This is almost exactly how my mother made one of her sugary fruit pies. You will need a loose-bottomed tart tin measuring 20cm wide by 3cm deep and a flat baking sheet, which should be placed in the oven at the outset.

Serves 4

all-butter puff pastry 320g packet, ready‑rolled

gooseberries 600g, topped and tailed

caster sugar 5 tbsp, plus a little extra for the pastry crust

cornflour 1 tbsp

cloves 6 (only their tiny buds pinched off with the fingers from the stalk, then crumbled into the fruit)

egg 1, beaten

fridge-cold butter 40g

Heat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Lightly grease the tart tin with the butter. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry until wide enough to line the tin, as well as allowing a slight excess to flop over the rim.

Put in the fridge and chill for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the remaining third of the pastry to make a lid for the pie and chill this too.

Mix the gooseberries, sugar, cornflour and clove buds in a roomy bowl until all are well coated and sticky (a sturdy spatula is best for doing this). Remove the pastry-lined tin from the fridge and fill with the gooseberry mixture, then brush a little beaten egg around the excess edge of the pastry. Now remove the pastry lid from the fridge, flop it over the fruit and neatly press the pastry edges together.

Brush the pie with beaten egg, then firmly indent the rim with the tines of a fork to both secure a seal and to pretty the thing. Note: any decoration attended upon pastry to be baked will only reveal itself post a wash of beaten egg.

Generously and evenly dredge the pie with caster sugar, make 3-4 incisions in the centre of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape, then slide the pie on to the baking sheet and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the pastry sports a deep golden shine and has an agreeably crisp surface (if you feel that the pastry is browning too rapidly towards the end of the cooking time, loosely cover with a sheet of foil).

Remove from the oven and leave in the tin until lukewarm before removing. Serve with thick, cold, double cream.

Strawberries in fleurie



Strawberries in fleurie. Photograph: Jason Lowe for Observer Food Monthly

I learned to make this dish while working as an apprentice in a French restaurant in Lancashire, during my mid-teens. The family owners used to import beaujolais from France in giant wooden barrels, then bottle it in the cellars. Occasionally I used to be called upon to help, which was a welcome break from the heat of the kitchen.

Serves 4

caster sugar 4 tbsp

fleurie (or another fresh and fruity beaujolais, such as chiroubles) 500ml

Grand Marnier or Cointreau 1 tbsp

ripe strawberries 600g, hulled

Whisk together the sugar, wine and chosen liqueur in a roomy bowl. Tip in the strawberries and leave to macerate in the fridge, covered with clingfilm, for a minimum of one hour, but no longer than three.

947,"Crunchy salads and tender chicken recipes from the founder of the Little Bread Pedlar bakery

As a child, summer picnics meant trips out in my grandad's Skoda 130, cool-box packed with sandwiches, to seaside destinations such as Southport, Cleethorpes and Morecambe. We often had to eat in the car while waiting for the rain to stop, using plastic plates, cutlery and cups that folded out from a little round disc.

If we made it out of the car we would be shivering on the beach eating sandwiches – egg with salad cream the main filling. We huddled for protection behind the windbreaker, but nothing could save us from sandy sandwiches.

Nowadays, for me, a picnic is solely about getting outside. Whether it's out of the city or under the nearest tree. I enjoy food suited to outdoor eating that complements the surroundings with an abundance of fragrant herbs, plenty of juicy crunch, and a little extra salt as we sweat in the sunshine. Sandwiches, sandy or otherwise, are seldom on the list.

Kohlrabi, cabbage and caraway salad

A perfect way to add a little crunch.

serves 6-8

cabbage 400g, white or red or hispi

salt 10g

kohlrabi 2, peeled

chervil or flat-leaf parsley 2 tbsp

red onion ½, thinly sliced

caraway seeds 1 tsp

For the dressing

lemon juice of ½

apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp

Dijon mustard ½ tsp

extra virgin olive oil 6 tbsp

pepper

Shred the cabbage and add a teaspoon of fine sea salt. Sit the cabbage in a colander weighed down under two plates for 1 hour to draw some of the moisture out and then rinse and drain thoroughly. Coarsely grate the kohlrabi. Chop the chervil or flat-leaf parsley. Add the onion, caraway, kohlrabi and herbs to the cabbage once it has been rinsed and drained. Mix all the ingredients for the dressing and add to the vegetables. This benefits from sitting together overnight.

Cherry belle radishes and duck egg

To feed 6

radishes 18 cherry belle, French breakfast or other medium-mild eating

duck eggs 6

Maldon or other flaky sea salt a little container

Wash the radishes, keeping the leaves intact. Bring a pan of water to the boil and boil the duck eggs, 7 minutes for soft boiled, 7½ for ""fudgy"" yolk – my favourite. Cool immediately under running cold water and leave in the shells until time to eat.

Peel the eggs. Dip the radishes in the salt as you go. Take a bite of the radish then the egg. Dunk if you wish.

Beetroot, Sicilian tomato and goat's curd salad

serves 6

young beetroot 1 bunch, with leaves

red wine/white wine/cider vinegar 1 tbsp

Sicilian tomatoes 6 medium

mint leaves a handful

lemon juice

olive oil

salt and pepper

goat's curd (or any young fresh goat's cheese) 150g

Destalk the beetroot, wash it and gently simmer, unpeeled with a little salt and a splash of vinegar until tender, about 45 minutes. Run the beetroot under cold water and when it is cool enough to handle, peel it. Slice it with the tomatoes, add the mint leaves, season with lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Arrange cheese on top.

This can easily be prepared a day ahead, just hold back on the goat's cheese and mint. It is best served at room temperature, not chilled.

Courgette and onion focaccia with borlotti bean and basil dip

The dough is made the day before and kept in the fridge. This allows what little yeast there is to slowly ferment. The topping can be assembled the day before to soften the vegetables, making them more oven-hardy.

For the focaccia

water 375 ml

fresh yeast 1g, or ⅛ tsp dried yeast - if you haven't got electric scales and are using fresh yeast then use a piece the size of a sunflower seed

bread flour 500g

salt 1g

olive oil 100ml

For the topping

onion 1 medium, cut into 1cm slices

courgettes 2, cut along diagonal into 1cm slices

thyme a small handful, picked

olive oil 100ml

flaky salt a good few pinches

This is easiest made in a mixer but can be done by hand with a bit more elbow grease. Whether using a mixer or not put the water and yeast in the bowl. Add the flour and mix gently just until incorporated.

Leave this for half an hour before adding the salt. This is the autolyse period, important for passively developing the gluten that is going it give your bread strength. If allowed to form now it will take less mixing and will result in a better flavoured loaf.

After the half hour add the salt to the dough and mix on a medium speed in the mixer for 5 minutes or work by hand for 10. It is quite a wet dough but embrace this and don't be tempted to add more flour. As it comes together it will become less sticky. A plastic scraper is handy for this job and much recommended.

After the mixing period the dough should be much shinier and stronger than at the beginning. Now it is strong enough you can add the olive oil. Mix it in slowly until all incorporated.

Place your dough in an oiled container that will allow it to expand to twice its size. Cover with another splash of oil, cover it and leave at room temperature.

After an hour take it from the tub and give it a little lift and shake, rotating it and shaking it to stretch in a controlled fashion three times. Cover and put in the fridge. Leave for another hour repeat the previous step. Cover with more oil, cover the container tightly and put back into the fridge where it will slowly ferment overnight.

Mix all the topping ingredients together except the flaky salt; cover and refrigerate until needed.

About an hour before you're ready to bake, remove the dough from the fridge and place on a lined tray. Tip any oil from the tub onto it and leave.

Every 15 minutes give it a little dimpling down (making dimples with your fingers).

After 45 minutes poke the topping into the dimples including any oil.

Leave for 15 more minutes.

Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Sprinkle the foccacia with a generous amount of flaky sea salt. Bake for 10 minutes then rotate it and turn the oven down to 200C/gas mark 6 for a further 5 minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool before slicing. Good eaten with the dip below.

For the dip

Take 400g of tinned or freshly cooked borlotti beans and smash up with a clove of garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and a little water. Tear basil leaves into it.

Roast chicken thighs with aioli

There's nothing nicer than a tender piece of roasted chicken on the bone dipped in a green garlic aioli.

Serves 6

chicken thighs 6, free range and organic

olive oil

thyme, rosemary and bay a handful

salt and pepper

wild garlic (optional)

For the aioli

garlic 4 cloves

egg yolks 2, free range

Dijon mustard 1 tsp

extra virgin olive oil 150ml

lemon juice of ½

salt

Roast the chicken with 2 tbsp of oil, herbs and salt and pepper at 180C/gas mark 4 for 20 minutes or until a skewer draws clear juices. If you're using wild garlic throw it in just for the last couple of minutes.

To make the aioli by hand, crush the garlic cloves under the flat of a knife and pulp, adding a good pinch of salt to help break it down.

Put the garlic in a bowl with the yolks and Dijon mustard. Whisk while slowly adding the oil bit by bit. What you want is a steady trickle and to see the mixture in the bowl emulsify. It should thicken, rather than slacken, as the oil is added. As you get towards the end of the oil add the lemon juice. Taste for seasoning.

Little devilled crab tarts



Little devilled crab tarts. Photograph: Kate Whitaker for Observer Food Monthly

Makes 12 x 9cm tarts

For the pastry (make a couple of hours before you want to line the muffin tray or tart cases to give the pastry time to rest)

plain flour 200g

rye flour 50g

mustard powder ¼ tsp

paprika ¼ tsp

cayenne pepper a pinch

salt ½ tsp

icing sugar 20g

cold butter 125g, cut into small pieces

ice-cold water about 3 tsp but it depends on your flour

egg yolk 1

For the filling

butter 75g

cayenne pepper ¼ tsp

mustard powder ½ tsp

paprika ¼ tsp

crab meat 400g - mixed about half and half, brown and white

Worcestershire sauce 8 shakes

Tabasco 8 shakes

lemon juice good squeeze

mild chillies thinly sliced for topping (optional)

Mix the flours, spices, salt and icing sugar then add the cold butter. This is best done with a food processor, but it can be done by hand. The result should resemble fresh breadcrumbs. Coat the flour evenly with the butter without overworking and warming the butter.

Add a couple of teaspoons of ice‑cold water to the yolk and add this to the flour and butter. You want a fairly dry dough that comes together with a little bit of working. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Line the tart cases, cutting the pastry to the thickness of a 10 pence piece.

Chill for an hour or two. Then blind bake with baking beans at 180C/gas mark 4 for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beans and turn the oven down to 160C/gas mark 2½. The pastry should be cooked through and golden as they won't be going back in.

For the filling, melt the butter on a low heat and gently fry the spices for a couple of minutes. Add this to the crab and other ingredients. Taste and adjust, adding a couple of pinches of salt.

Once the tart shells are cool, fill them with the crab meat.

949,"My girlfriend of 18 months and I had unprotected sex. She became worried that she had contracted an STI, despite having no symptoms. Although she was never accusatory, she became unwilling to have sex. The results were negative, but then she became convinced she was suffering from genital warts. She now feels she ""can't have sex while this virus might still be in my body"". We have satisfying non-penetrative sex – but should I worry about her?

Some STIs can indeed be present without obvious symptoms. Concerns about STIs are always valid, and the worries that are expressed by a partner should always be respected. But you have picked up on the possibility that there might be another issue here, or another motivation for avoiding penetrative sex – and you may well be right. Perhaps non-penetrative sex is more enjoyable for her, as is the case for many women. Have a frank and open discussion about her preferred styles of sexual contact, and what best leads her to orgasm, and you may receive some important information. But mood disorders can also affect sexuality, and it is also possible she may suffer from anxiety, or a related problem to do with being over-anxious about her health. If you think this might be true, help soothe her and gently suggest she takes steps to address her general anxiety, which will affect more than just your sex life.

951,"Tired of twiddling your thumbs during downloads? Try these remedies for speeding up a dozy old PC before you almost lose the will to live

Probably the most common reason people ditch their old computer and buy a new one is not that the old one is broken in any way, but that it’s simply running slowly. There are plenty of suggestions online, as well as paid-for products, which claim to fix slowness. Many of these will make little difference and some may make the problem even worse. There are a few key things that are well worth trying before giving up on your trusty PC or Windows laptop (and many of these will work for Macs too), but before you attempt anything, it’s vital that you back-up your files.

Viruses and antiviruses

Viruses or malware on your computer are very likely to slow it down. If they manage to gain control of your computer before your antivirus kicks in, they can hide themselves. One answer is to run an offline virus scan from a CD or USB memory stick independently of Windows – Sophos or Kaspersky are possibilities. There are also free, reliable and lightweight antivirus programs available, such as Avast. Be aware that duelling antivirus programs can cause extreme slowness. If you've switched antivirus programs, make sure you uninstall any earlier programs.

Background and startup programs

Having cleaned up any viruses and made sure your regular antivirus program is functioning and up to date, the next thing to look at is whether you have any unused programs installed or running in the background. You can do this from within Windows, but it's easier if you download the free version of CCleaner and run it. Click the Tools tab on the left and select Uninstall.

If you use Adobe Reader you can download a lightweight alternative such as Foxit Reader or SumatraPDF for viewing PDF files and then uninstall the Adobe offering. The same applies for video players. Media Player Classic is a lightweight alternative to Windows Media Player.

If you haven't yet, you should experiment using Opera or Chrome, which are the fastest browsers available, and can perform significantly better on old hardware.

Programs which start up along with Windows, as well as browser plug-ins, can really slow down computers. The Startup button on CCleaner shows these start-up programs. It’s hard to give specific advice on what you can disable, but learn more about the things you don't recognise and get rid of what you don't need. And if you’ve collected any of those pesky browser toolbars which come along for the ride, you can disable them too.

Hard disks

A tired or full hard disk can slow a computer down. In order to keep your computer running smoothly, you need to leave 10-15% of your hard drive space free. If you're running out of space, you should consider deleting unnecessary programs or moving files you no longer need to an external drive.

Modern hard disks can suffer from low performance before failing completely. Diagnose the health of your hard disk with software such as SpeedFan, which can give you more information than Windows.

One easy and affordable way to increase the speed for some operations in your computer is to upgrade to a solid state drive (SSD). This can reduce the loading time of the operating system, as well as the time required to load and access software and files. Make sure your computer supports hard drives using a SATA connector and that you use an operating system optimised for them (anything beyond Windows XP will do).

Reinstall your operating system – or move to Linux

If all else fails then the “nuclear option” of reinstalling Windows and all your programs and data will usually help. You might also need to install more memory: 512MB is the minimum for Windows XP, 1GB for Vista, Windows 7 or later. However, if you’re still running XP then you’re living dangerously. Think about using Linux, a free and open-source operating system – there are versions that will run happily even on an old laptop from the last century.

First of all it's good to consider what sort of “flavour” you want. Ubuntu, Xubuntu Linux, and Linux Mint may appeal to those who are used to Windows. If you want the lightest and least resource-hungry system to make your older hardware really fly again, Puppy Linux and Lubuntu are two very small and effective options. Most Linux distributions are designed to run directly from a CD or USB stick as a “live installation”. This enables you to try the operating system out before you commit to installing it.

• This article was amended at the writers' request on 16 June 2014. An earlier version suggested that Linux Mint looked like Mac OS.

953,"As more and more of us open up the lap top on the kitchen table instead of heading into an office, it's worth considering what the pros and cons are

One in seven of the employed apparently works from home. When you think of the irritation of getting to work, even when there isn't a strike on and it's not raining, it seems ideal, especially now that you can Google any information you need. But has its drawbacks, and not just the fact that you don't pick up on the office gossip.

If you have anyone staying, instead of meeting them at the pub or the cinema after work, you have them hanging about the place saying: ""I know I mustn't disturb you but…"" And if there are children about, they always need attention just when you're really rushed. But the main frustration is that, as there are always half a dozen things that need doing, you waste ages trying to decide whether it's the laptop or the imminent collapse of the plate rack that needs doing first. My husband used to cook and would choose the most complicated and time-consuming recipe – because, as he admitted, cooking was a Work Avoidance Scheme.

959,"Yiannis Kouros setting the world record for the 24-hour race in Adelaide in 1997, or maybe Paula Radcliffe's 2003 London Marathon – my own selections are mostly about time, not battles between rival runners

""Racing is life, everything before or after is just waiting."" This is one of my favourite quotes and while my teammate Paul Navesey and I were ""waiting"" recently, we had a good debate about what was the greatest running race of all time. Which one would we go back to watch if we actually had a time machine? Because obviously, that's what we'd do if we could move across time and space, go watch some running...

Does a race need competition? Watching it live, you would say yes, but the list below we've come up with is almost entirely about time, not battles. Leaders far ahead, and pushing beyond impossible, their competitors only allowed to fight for second place. So without further ado, and in no particular order, here are 10 races that we'd go back to see. Who would come with us? Or would you rather set the time machine for a different time and place?

Our top five

Mainly because you would, obviously, sit next to Adolf Hitler and cheer like crazy when Jesse Owens smashes the field to win his third gold of the games.

In 1997, Yiannis Kouros ran one of the most formidable world records on the track - one that he insists ""will last for centuries"". Having run a few 24 hour races myself only proves to me just how strong this is - no one has even got near. With an average speed of over 12.5km/h (that's a pace of 7'39 minutes per mile) to reach 303km in 24hrs, Kouros's comment may well hold true.

Doctors said it was physically impossible, but Sir Roger Bannister didn't combust along the way; he just set a standard for runners to aim at for years to come. Who knows how quickly he would have run if it wasn't on a cinder track with leather shoes.

Four guys who had never lost over the distance racing one of the greatest 100 mile racers in the world: it was like four unbeaten boxers being thrown into a ring at the same time and the last man standing victorious. The film Unbreakable is nearly as good a time machine.

The only record that comes close to Kouros's dominance, Paula Radcliffe set a mark of 2.15.25 at the London marathon that has stood for 11 years - and may still be there for another 10, or at least until Genzebe Dibaba runs a marathon.

Five more to throw into the ring



When run properly, it's the world's toughest race. At the London Olympics, David Rudisha smashed the world record in effortless style.

Kyle Skaggs runs 100 miles in under 24 hours, then promptly retires to live on a farm.

The Bob Graham Round

OK, so it's not a race, but Billy Bland's 13:53 record, for those who know the terrain, is immense. Go to the Lakes and try just one leg, I dare you.

Yes, there was some cycling and swimming first, but it was the run that separated Dave Scott and Mark Allen, head-to-head for most of the way!

Tipton track 100, 1975

Cavin Woodward ran 4:58 to break the 50 Mile World Record, 6:25 for a 100k WR and then hung on for dear life to break the 100 mile record in 11:38. Suicide pacing at its very best.

961,"The five gold medal-winning UK paralympian on being punished for smoking, 100-mile races, and the benefits of barefoot running

Where is your favourite place to run - and why? My favourite place to run has changed with time. It used to be a packed Olympic stadium (the gladiator in me) but now I am loving London's streets and parks and the mountains of Japan. Basically, anywhere that stimulates the senses.

Is it true that you were made to run five miles a day every day for a month in punishment for being caught smoking when you were 12? True. The teacher would follow us in his car. We dreaded those runs but they made me tough and that training got me third in the school cross-country, which gave me the incentive to achieve.

Do you remember your first ever race? I remember coming second in my primary school sports day but my first ""real"" taste of success was when our school (a boarding school for blind and visually impaired kids) won the Warwickshire schools cross-country, beating all the ""normal"" kids! Big kudos in our eyes! We were 14 or 15, I think.

What's your greatest running achievement? Winning the 5k/10k double at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics carrying a stress fracture in my left tibia.

When someone asks for a training tip what do you tell them? Consistent hard work. No secrets to success.

Do you like a running gadget? If so, what's your favourite?

I love the new Garmin with the cadence data function but that's because I'm a geeky running specialist physiotherapist. However, if push comes to shove, all you need is a pair of shoes and love of life.

Do you run to music? What do you listen to? No music. Having one sense compromised when I run is probably enough!

What's your favourite post-race indulgence? Cake or a good burger.

You are a physiotherapist - can (and do) you treat, or at least diagnose yourself? Yes. I do practise what I preach as a physio. Simple principles, applied specifically.

What is the worst thing about running? There's no worst thing about running. If you're able to run it's all good. (Though we tend to take that for granted)

And the best..? Those runs where the harder you push, the better it feels.

What do you eat on the morning of a race (or a long run)?I don't eat on the morning of a long run because I am trying to become fat adapted but eat carbs on race day, with some fat and protein.

What's the furthest distance you've ever run? 50k in training which was how I managed to get a stress fracture pre-Atlanta 1996. My bucket list does however include the Ultra Trail Mount Fuji 100-mile race so I am working on longer runs.

Do you ever run barefoot? Or in barefoot-style shoes..? I am a big fan both as a runner and as a physio in the ""concept"" of natural running. I run in lightweight low-drop shoes but wouldn't try a true barefoot shoe as it represents a significant risk even with gradual adaptation. I do think barefoot running will improve strength and may reduce injury, but the latter in a small percentage of runners.

If you had to choose who to watch, would it be Mo Farah or Usain Bolt? Mo every time

Who is the greatest runner ever? Difficult to determine given the breadth of the sport. Mo has to be up there because of his range but the beauty of running is that our concept of ""impossible"" is continually being challenged.

963,"Saturday morning saw me lining up for my first ""proper"" 10k race this year – I've done a couple recently, including the Nike We Own the Night women's run and the Bupa 10k, but those were both done as training runs, albeit hard ones. This one, one of the many organised by the Sri Chinmoy running club, was more a proper test of form, and I'm glad to report it went well – though somewhat frustratingly I was seven whole seconds outside my PB.

I can't decide whether to be very happy about that as I wasn't sure I was going to get anywhere near it, or annoyed that I came so close to breaking it. I was well inside it at the 5k mark, but alas suffered with a slight stitch and grimaced my way around the third and fourth laps of Battersea Park. I wish I could blame a large breakfast but since it was an 8am race, I hadn't had any – I think it was more just the effort and some uneven breathing. Does anyone else find that once they start thinking about their breathing, they suddenly appear to be utterly incapable of doing it? Helpful, that.

Anyway it was a good race, I finished fifth and even got a small trophy. Then Sunday saw me doing a lovely easy eight-mile run – there is nothing as relaxing as a post-race run where you have every excuse in the world to take the pace as easy as you like. Then Junior parkrun with my eldest daughter again, and rather a lot of cake. For the record, my current favourite post-run cake is the Riverford banana bread.

965,"Is lemon meringue pie an ostentatious delight deserving of modernisation, or a retro dessert best left in the past? And which other dated desserts deserve a revival?

If any dish could be described as blowsy, it's the lemon meringue pie; that overblown Dolly of desserts, all sweet bouffant meringue above a core acid enough to put young Jolene right off her game. There's something joyously vulgar about its showy charms, and its brief but brilliant flowering – it won't keep long enough to reward moderation, so gorge yourself before it's gone. Because of this, and because it seems to be something of an endangered species on menus these days (right up there with black forest gateau and île flottante), the LMP is a recipe well worth mastering. After all, who knows when you might be called upon to soothe a broken heart with such sugared succor?

The pastry

Annie Bell's lemon meringue pie.

For all the glitz and glamour of the topping, the LMP is built upon good honest shortcrust – though Annie Bell borrows her mum's recipe, using a truly buttery biscuit base, in her Baking Bible. It's delicious, but not strong enough to cope with the voluptuousness above, crumbling into sweet submission around the sides.

In contrast, chef Matthew Tomkinson bakes shortbread foundations for his rather fancy take on the classic pie, which adds a welcome savoury note, but only works with individual versions like his – it's too solid for anything bigger.

Mary Berry and Dan Lepard use a sweet shortcrust enriched with egg and icing sugar, while Cook's Illustrated magazine prefers a plainer, crunchier vegetable shortening and butter variety, which I find a bit puritan. I do, however, very much like their idea of rolling it out over crushed biscuits rather than flour, which helps keep the pastry crisp underneath the custardy filling.

The filling

Cook's Illustrated's lemon meringue pie.

This is what makes or breaks a LMP – the filling must tread a delicate line between balancing the sugary meringue above, and taking the roof off your mouth. Many make the mistake of trying to reconcile the sweet and sour flavours in the curd itself without taking the meringue into account, which renders the whole dessert too sweet.

Bell, for example, uses condensed milk as well as sugar in her retro recipe, sadly softening the lemon's mouth-puckering charms. Lepard's filling proves the most popular with the Guardian's tasting panel – the lemon juice-heavy mixture has a keen sharpness that Tomkinson's, diluted with double cream, or Cook's Illustrated, spiced with sweet vanilla, lack.

Berry's is almost as zingy, but the guinea pigs complain they can taste the cornflour, too – though this is the standard thickener (apart from Tomkinson's gelatine, which, along with the cream, makes his into more of a lemon panna cotta than a curd), excessive amounts result in an odd floury flavour, as well as a slightly jellied texture.

David Lebovitz and Cook's Illustrated both stick butter in as well, which gives their fillings a pleasant richness of flavour. I'm not sure Lepard's orange juice contributes much except colour, however – I prefer the aromatic lemon zest everyone else adds along with the juice.

The meringue

Dan Lepard's lemon meringue pie.

The topping should be crunchy above, fluffy and marshmallow-like below, which means a fairly brief cooking time. Only Tomkinson uses an Italian meringue, made with hot sugar syrup, and then toasted on top with a blowtorch. It looks good, but lacks the crisp shell that cracks so satisfyingly beneath the spoon in the other pies.

Berry and Cook's Illustrated add a little cornflour to their meringue mixture to stabilise it, which seems to give it more body. I find the latter's vanilla essence distracting, though; the meringue should taste purely sweet in contrast to the sour curd beneath.

The cooking method

Mary Berry's lemon meringue pie.

Most recipes make the pie all in one go, adding the meringue to the warm filling as soon as it's been poured into the blind-baked pastry shell. Indeed, Cook's Illustrated directs the reader to reheat the filling before combining the two, reasoning that ""if the filling is piping hot when the meringue is applied, the underside of the meringue will not undercook; if the oven temperature is relatively low, the top of the meringue won't overcook"".

Lepard, however, advises the reader to: ""Chill the filled tart fully before covering with meringue. This lessens the topping leaking syrup, caused by steam released from the hot filling dissolving the meringue before it's cooked."" Whatever the science, his pie certainly has the best structure of them all, with distinct and satisfying layers of smooth curd and marshmallowy meringue.

Matthew Tomkinson's lemon meringue pie.

This method also has the benefit of allowing you to do all the time-consuming work ahead of time, then simply make and cook the meringue (a 20 minute job) before serving. And if there's anything, apart from a rhinestone catsuit, more likely to wow guests on arrival than the sight of a billowing blond meringue emerging hot from the oven, I'd surely like to see it.

The perfect lemon meringue pie

For the pastry:

225g plain flour

2tbsp caster sugar

1/2tsp salt

120g cold butter, grated

1 egg yolk

2tbsp cold water

3 digestives, crushed

For the filling:

Zest of 3 lemons, juice of 6 (about 200ml)

50ml water

25g cornflour

175g caster sugar

3 egg yolks

25g butter

For the meringue:

4 egg whites

225g caster sugar

2tsp cornflour

For the pastry, mix the flour, sugar and salt, then rub in the butter (you can do this in a food processor if you prefer) to coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and just enough water to bring together into a ball. Flatten, wrap, and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a 20-22cm tart tin with a loose base.

Scatter half the crushed digestives on the work surface and roll out the pastry to about a 5mm thickness on it. Scatter the top with the remaining crushed biscuits, and use to line the tart tin, trimming it neatly so there's still a little standing proud of the top of the tin. Chill for another 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 170C/325F/gas mark four.

Line the tin with greaseproof paper and baking beans or similar, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the beans and paper, and bake for another 5-7 minutes until the pastry is dry and pale golden. Leave to cool while you make the filling.

Put the lemon juice and zest in a saucepan with the water and whisk in the cornflour until smooth, then stir in the sugar and yolks. Heat gently, stirring, until warm, then add the butter and bring to the boil, still stirring. It should be as thick as custard. Spoon into the tart case and allow to cool completely.

Heat the oven back to 170C. To make the meringue, whisk the whites until soft peaks form. Add the sugar a spoonful at a time, and whisk until the meringue is stiff and shiny. Whisk in the cornflour, then spoon the mixture on to the top of the pie and shape artistically. Bake for 15 minutes until the meringue is golden. Allow to cool before serving.

967,"From offering free travel if you shop in city centres to hang outs in shops – Japan's town centres are getting a new lease of life

A study by a Japanese thinktank last month predicted that half of the country's municipalities face drastic depopulation, particularly among young women, as smaller towns lose residents to larger cities.

The consequences of this population shift have been felt in downtown areas in provincial Japan. Shops have been left vacant while local officials scratch their heads over how to restore vitality to these areas.

In the UK, there is a similar problem. Dubbed the death of the high street, government is grappling with how to mitigate against decline caused by shop closures and degeneration. So, what can Britain learn from Japan?

Japanese government plans, as with the growth agenda in the UK, identify the revival of town and city centres as vital to economic renewal. This is clear from prime minister Shinzo Abe's goal to create a ""compact city"", in which everything in a city is close together and accessible. This is one part of the prime minister's three-pronged strategy.

Communities minister Brandon Lewis' future high streets forum, which advises government on the challenges facing high streets and helps to develop policies so town centres can grow, is very similar to the Japanese government's committee for improvement and vitalisation of city centres.

Responses to the economic slump of the early 1990s saw attempts to import US and British models of town management organisations to mitigate against city centre decline on account of the growth of out of town retailing. Some of these schemes ended with little to show for themselves other than bankruptcy.

Their failure was partly due to poor citizen engagement and reckless management, though limited footfall on account of a notoriously car-orientated society no doubt played a part.

A number of differing responses have blossomed today. Here are two examples:

Hagi

The city of Hagi, in Abe's birthplace Yamaguchi, is notable because it was the birthplace of Japan's emergence as a modern state under the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The formation of Hagi as a merged municipality in 2005 saw a small increase in population to 53,000, but its centre continued to grapple with closed shops and an ageing population.

In recent years however, the Japanese Machinoeki movement found favour in the city and provided a citizen-led approach to regaining civic pride. Machinoeki (which is translated as community station) exist across Japan and it involves existing shops providing spaces for people to rest, relax and chat to their fellow citizens.

Any space can register and be recognised as belonging to the national network of over 1,000 Machinoeki, whose brand is symbolic of citizen-led regeneration.

In Hagi the concept was tweaked to emphasise the role of volunteer tour guides and offer hospitality to visitors to create a more welcoming and pedestrian-friendly city. This got the city council's support through a law to promote their adoption and hospitality was embeded in all the city's policies.

Toyama

Toyama was formed by merging with neighbouring municipalities in 2005. This was necessary due to a demographic change and falling revenues.

It has been led ever since then by mayor Masashi Mori who wants Toyama to be held up as a global model of a compact city.

In 2007 it was the first city to secure central support for its revitalisation plan, centred on promoting city centre living and connectivity via a new light rail system.

Among the mayor's initiatives is offering free admission for senior citizens accompanied by grandchildren to city-run attractions. This is extended to couples on certain evenings. Food grown on city centre allotments tended by older people is also used for community gatherings.

For Mori this approach combats depopulation, and connects younger and older people in the area. Foreign visitors and even local residents who buy bunches of flowers in the centre of the city get to ride free on the tram under another of Mori's pet schemes.

Mori's policies have seen city centre living increase from 28% of the municipality's population in 2005 to 32% in 2013, aiming for 42% by 2020, and this bucks the national trend. Mori was appointed to represent Japan's city mayors on the government's advisory council on decentralisation.

Toyama's compact city model shows the value of citizen participation and leadership for city centre renewal. It also shows how important it is to learn from other cities around the world. The goal in Japan is for local areas to use their unique characteristics to promote themselves to a global audience.

969,"Think that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and their ilk are out of control, and you would like to regain some of the privacy you once enjoyed? Help may be at hand in the form of ""antisocial networking"" – a clutch of new apps and websites designed to hide you from the seemingly irresistible march of technological intrusion.

Proudly billing itself as ""the antisocial network"", Cloak works by turning social media against itself, mining real-time geographical location data from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare accounts to warn you if your ""friends"" are nearby. This enables you to take a different route and avoid meeting them. While it may be of particular use to cheating spouses, its creators insist that its purpose is broad: ""Avoid exes, co-workers, that guy who likes to stop and chat, anyone you'd rather not run into,"" it says.

""I think that the age of mass social networking has reached its peak, at least for us first-worlders,"" said Cloak's co-creator Chris Baker, who also founded the hugely successful viral news platform Buzzfeed . ""Platforms like Facebook and Twitter are public arenas where we cultivate versions of ourselves that are well-manicured, mostly false, and always 'on'. I think that is what's beginning to wane. We're exhausted from it and by it. Now platforms that enable ephemeral, private and very loose moments are starting to become hugely mainstream. Antisocial stuff is on the rise. Social has had its moment in the sun. Now people are beginning to revolt.""

Similar in function to Cloak is Split. Its creator, Udi Dagan, echoed Baker's assessment. ""Social networking has got to a stage where we have all realised this is just too much. We need to regain control over our lives,"" he said. ""The virtual world and the real world – it's all a mix and it's becoming overwhelming. So we will see more and more technology that will help us reclaim our space and create the necessary separation.""

Last year the American writer Jonathan Franzen bemoaned the omnipresence of social networking which forces us to interact constantly with others, rather than spending time in our own thoughts. ""Who has time to read literature when there are so many blogs to keep up with, so many food fights to follow on Twitter?"" he asked in a book, The Kraus Project.

There is evidence that Facebook and Twitter make many of us unhappy as they push us to maintain an unrealistically positive public persona. A recent University of London study explained: ""The public nature of a user's Facebook profile means that users' social lives are particularly open to scrutiny from others."" And the network can even break up relationships: ""Site use can lead to increased jealousy and/or obsessive behaviour, as a result of the opportunities it provides users to access … information about their partner that would not otherwise be accessible.""

The fear of being judged has resulted in social networking excluding many people who lack social confidence. For them there is Anomo, a social network for people who only want to reveal little bits of themselves at a time. Once users have built up a relationship with another, they can swap photos and personal details. Around 100,000 people have signed up worldwide.

James Sun, Anomo's co-founder, said the thinking behind Anomo was that social networking had become ""too much, too fast … At the click of a button people can access your whole life, but in the real world people share things over time. So I set up an app with protective layers, one where people only reveal things when they want.""

He believes the shift from the social to the antisocial is only just beginning. ""We are going to see more ephemeral networking where things do not persist and where people can conceal their identities. So I don't think this is a blip, I think it's a pendulum swing.""

For some, even Anomo can be too personal – sometimes you have something that you feel you cannot reveal even to your closest friends. If you have some gossip to spread or a sensitive subject to discuss, but you don't want it traced back to you, you can try two new services that allow you to post anonymous messages: Whisper and Secret.

Last week messages posted on Whisper ranged from the astonishing to the deeply affecting, including:

■ ""I recently came to the belief that my dad is a drug dealer. But I don't have enough proof to do anything.""

■ ""I pay for two Netflix accounts so my family doesn't know I watch lesbian movies. It's been five years and I still can't come out to them.""

■ ""I was deployed to Afghanistan. No one knows the thoughts running through my head, which tree is sniper prone, which car is an IED. This affects my family more than they know.""",Antisocial networks: how to avoid Facebook 'friends' and irritate people,http://www.theguardian.com,"[Gareth Rubin, Lola Okolosie, Laurie Penny]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/30/1401481281412/Cloak-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=38928047d8747631df17f364f514aef1,2014-06-01 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/01/antisocial-networks-social-media-private-thoughts-apps-distance-online-friends-technology
971,"Critics say that if search engine knows of illegal activity, it shouldn't help to send business its way

Google's decision to allow users to easily de-list certain personal information from search results has infuriated a film and music industry that argues the internet giant should act as decisively to help squash digital piracy.

On Friday Google bowed to an EU privacy ruling, dubbed the ""right to be forgotten"", launching a webpage where European citizens can request links to information about them be taken off search results.

The move came a day after Google had been lambasted for not doing enough to curb online piracy in a report by David Cameron's intellectual property adviser, Mike Weatherley.

Critics say that Google drags its feet over carrying out measures such as stripping pirate websites from its search results, yet the move to allow users the ""right to be forgotten"" proves it can take serious action if it is forced.

""It's 'Don't be Evil' 101,"" says Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the music industry's trade body, the BPI. ""The principle at stake here is when you know someone is acting illegally, you shouldn't continue helping them by sending them business.""

Google is extremely reluctant to fiddle with its algorithm, the golden goose that underpins a $383bn global operation, but has been known to do so to protect its business. Companies including Rap Genius have seen a traffic-killing demotion in web listings as punishment by Google for breaking its search marketing rules.

""Google say they don't want to interfere with their algorithm,"" says Taylor. ""But the algorithm is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. It is written by Google engineers, they choose how it operates and whether to act ethically and responsibly or not.""

Meanwhile Taylor says the music industry continues to be ravaged, with more than 1bn illegal track downloads last year worth in excess of £300m.

Dealing with Google is often a fraught process, Taylor adds, and the illegal websites reappear in the same, or a slightly different, guise almost immediately after they are taken down.

The BPI made 4.6m requests to Google to remove pirate websites from its listings in the past month alone.

Weatherley's report, which made a series of recommendations to business secretary Vince Cable, said market leader Google had to acknowledge the important role it plays in funnelling traffic to illegal sites. However, the MP also defended Google, pointing out that the search engine industry is not to blame for piracy. Just 13% of illegal downloaders use search engines, including Google, to access music sites, and 8% for film sites, according to snapshot research by Ofcom. Yet Ofcom recognises there is a major issue, with 50% of internet users who downloaded or streamed films in a three-month period doing so without paying.

Google defenders point out that serious piracy is done by a hardcore of users – Ofcom says 1.6% of UK internet users account for 79% of all illegal activity – and by no means the public at large that use its search engine. ""If Google stopped listing all of the top pirate sites, people would still find them,"" says John Enser, partner at Olswang. ""Their issue is about due process and the need to ensure that the amount of stuff taken down is not damaging free speech.""

Google has been accused of being slow to react, and a report from the culture select committee last September branded its anti-piracy efforts to date as ""derisorily ineffective"".

""We have been calling for a long time for Google in particular to be more proactive in dealing with the issue of illegal content in its search results,"" says Taylor.

One industry source says there was a time when Google did have an arrogant ""swagger"" toward rights holders and content protection. However the company is much more proactive now, taking down 23m illegal web links in the last month alone.

Google spends tens of millions of pounds on technology to tackle piracy and says it is a major supporter of the ""Follow The Money"" initiative, choking off the vital revenue from advertising that pirate sites depend on. ""Google is committed to tackling piracy and our action is industry-leading,"" said a Google spokesman.

Chris Marcich, president of the European arm of the Hollywood studio lobbying group MPA, points out that the piracy and privacy issues are part of a much bigger battle that Google is waging. ""The more fundamental issue is that Google is fighting hard to try to preserve the illusion of neutrality – that they are an intermediary that doesn't interact with services they provide,"" he says.

""They are doing this because they don't want to be responsible for what goes on with their services. I don't think that is tenable long term.

""Google is very central in our daily lives, they are de facto the only real search engine in Europe and as such have a greater responsibility to make sure the law is respected.""","If Google can get rid of personal data, why can't it purge the pirates?",http://www.theguardian.com,"[Maggie Brown, Mark Sweney]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/30/1401467252698/Google--011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=2c8512528b32f3d5c391432280965d51,2014-06-01 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/01/google-personal-data-digital-pirates
973,"One look at the whiteboard in Business Insider’s Manhattan office shows the scale of the company’s ambition. Under the words “World Domination”, a hand-drawn map shows North America, Australia, India and China crossed off – all territories where BI now has offices. Europe is next.

The man plotting BI’s global takeover is co-founder Henry Blodget, whose career could easily be the plot of a Tom Wolfe novel: a former Ivy League tennis ace and star analyst, he was brought low 12 years ago by a federal prosecutor – Eliot Spitzer, later scandal-hit himself – and kicked out of Wall Street. Now Blodget has reinvented himself as one of the kings of digital media.

His desk is easy to spot in the open newsroom. It’s raised so he can spend the day working on his feet. The desks on either side are raised too. “That’s peer pressure for you,” he says. He decided to stop sitting after reading articles on BI’s website about the health hazards. “More Terrifying Facts About How Sitting Will Kill You,” reads one. “ARE YOU SITTING DOWN? Watch Out! Your Job May Be Literally Killing You,” reads another.

The eminently clickable, caps-heavy headlines are typical BI fare. The sort of stories that ComScore calculates brought it 26 million readers a month on desktop and mobile in May – more than WSJ.com’s 21 million. They are also the sort of stories that have plenty of critics worried about the dumbing down of journalism. It works for readers. Traffic in the US is up 48% in the past year according to ComScore. In Britain it has risen 36% although the company doesn’t have a UK office. All that changeson Monday with the appointment of former CBS Interactive vice president Julian Childs as managing director of Business Insider UK, who, along with BI deputy editor Jim Edwards, will now start recruiting a London-based team to cover Europe.

We meet in the boardroom, labelled the War Room. In person Blodget defuses the combative impression left by the standing army of desks and threats of world domination. He is smart, approachable, introspective – a far cry from the old-school media mogul epitomised by the sinister whispering mode of Rupert Murdoch.

In part that’s because he sees himself as in the service industry rather than as a “broadcaster”, and also – like his peers – he has a long way to go to rival Murdoch’s reach. “The rise of social media has changed the way people find information, especially media, fundamentally,” he says. When BI started seven years ago Twitter and Facebook were not ways of finding news. BI could do a valuable service simply by aggregating interesting information in a single place. “When you have a billion people on Facebook each of whom has a customised front page, there is less reason for people to check a website.” Digital media companies need to find that audience, he argues.

The rapid growth of companies like BI, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post suggests they have found that transition easier than many established news players. The mistake many people made with digital media was not to recognise it was new. “Any time a new medium comes along, the existing media look at it and say: ‘Well it’s kinda like what we do and we can do something similar.’ TV is a perfect example of that. At first someone would read a newspaper or act out the radio interview. Then they realised pictures were incredibly powerful. Now 70 years later TV journalism is entirely different to print journalism,” Blodget says.

The same thing is now happening in digital media with the proliferation of new sites – including “explainer” site Vox.com or data whizz Nate Silver’s number crunching FiveThirtyEight – using new ways from video to long-form journalism to interactive graphics to tell stories, he points out. Blodget is also a big fan of Mail Online’s front page, as there is “nothing else like it anywhere, you can’t duplicate it on social media”.

For BI’s critics, however, its main innovation is the slideshow. A series of pictures that tell a story and force you to click through if you want to know more, generating more page views for the website with little real advantage to the reader. The one Blodget got the most stick for was “I Was Quite Surprised By Some Things On My American Airlines International ‘Economy Class’ Flight”, a 28-page slideshow about his discoveries on an economy flight back from Zurich. Sample slide: “I’m not going to say it was[Not] the best pasta I’ve ever eaten, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. Tortellini in cheese sauce. With some tomato sauce, too. And not-terrible steamed broccoli. Bottom line, it was totally fine food.”

To be fair it’s easy to pick a silly story from any news site and BI has reduced the number of slideshows and exclamatory headlines it runs. It has also published impressive long-form articles (one 21,000 word piece on Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer has so far produced 1.2m hits), and established an in-depth, subscription-only service, BI Intelligence, which for $425 a year provides reports into areas like mobile, social media and electronic payments. Everything is evolving, Blodget says, in reaction to what the readers want.

The good news, he adds, is that for all the change some truths are emerging. One is that being advertising-funded works as a business model for journalism – at least for digital companies. BI is lean by old media metrics. It employs just 175 people and expects a significant improvement on last year's $20m in revenues in 2014. It won’t make a profit. All the money is going back into subscriptions and the European rollout.

In the not-too-distant future, Blodget believes there will be a wave of consolidation and a handful of huge digital media companies will emerge with hundreds of millions in revenues employing thousands of journalists. BI has been rumoured to be in sales talks, a rumour he neither confirms nor denies. But he does say that as the market matures, scale will become more important and he sees BI as part of a larger organisation, either as a buyer or one of the bought.

Having once been the poor relation, content is sexy(ish) again. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos is a major investor in BI, he also owns the Washington Post and is just one of a number of tech moguls now interested in content. “Silicon Valley has always been focused on platforms,” says Blodget. “It almost has a pathological need to separate itself from the actual content.” But the pendulum has swung back – a bit – to content, in part because major platforms like Facebook, Google’s YouTube, LinkedIn and Twitter are so well-established and they all need quality content. User-generated content will only go so far, he says, and for professional journalists “it’s a golden age”.

Blodget counts himself very lucky to be witnessing this golden age. In 2002 the then Merrill Lynch analyst lost his job when New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer published emails in which Blodget appeared to be dissing stocks the broker was selling, calling them “dogs” or POS (piece of shit). He was charged with civil securities fraud, agreed to a permanent ban from the securities industry and paid a $2m fine. Spitzer went on to have his own Bonfire of the Vanities collapse - brought down by a prostitution scandal that derailed a career some had speculated could have ended in a run for the White House.

“Life is very strange. I now refer to Eliot on a first-name basis,” says Blodget. “We have both been through a lot. I don’t think we’ll ever agree about those emails.”

Blodget says Spitzer was right to pursue conflicts of interest within the industry but he still very much disagrees with Spitzer’s interpretation of his emails. “I never wrote a word in a research report that I didn’t believe. And talking about concepts in emails, reacting to things, is quite different to producing a professional opinion.”

“People say that you learn more from tough experiences than easy experiences and that was certainly true for me,” he says. But the scandal was “personally devastating” says Blodget, calling into question the one thing he most prized, the quality and honesty of his judgment.

Spitzer disagrees. He did not return a call for comment but last year he told the New Yorker that the emails showed Blodget’s true feelings and his compromised position. “I thought my professional career was over,” says Blodget. “I decided to spend every day that I had from then on trying to earn back the trust that I had lost … fortunately a lot of people have given me that chance.”

This article was amended on Tuesday 17 June 2014 to reflect the fact that Business Insider made $20m in revenue last year and is forecast to make more this year.

975,"Media watchdog Ofcom has launched an investigation into whether the BBC breached broadcasting standards after a Conservative MP swore during a live TV show.

The investigation into a possible breach “of content standards” comes after former police minister Nick Herbert used the term “fuckwit” while appearing as one of the guests on BBC2’s Daily Politics programme.

He later defended his actions and pointed out that he used the term “disapprovingly” while quoting from a disparaging comment made by a fellow guest, former police officer Peter Kirkham, in reference to home secretary Theresa May.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nick Herbert on BBC2's Daily Politics

Presenter Jo Coburn interrupted Herbert, telling him “we won’t have any more of that” and cautioning him to speak “without repeating any of those expletives”.

At the end of the programme – which was broadcast on BBC2 at noon – Coburn offered a full apology for the outburst, saying it was unacceptable and would not be repeated.

Explaining his actions on Twitter following the broadcast, Herbert said: “Shame on the former police officer on the prog who used the word to describe the home sec and who I was quoting disapprovingly.”

Nick Herbert (@nickherbertmp) @paulwaugh Err, I was quoting disapprovingly the former police officer on the prog who used the word about the Home Sec ....

During the programme Herbert was asked whether police would react badly to a speech by May and he replied: “I’m afraid there have been a minority who’ve been outspoken and they are very active on Twitter and so on. Peter himself just a day ago described the Home Secretary as a ’fuckwit’ in his own Twitter line.”

After being warned about his language, Herbert said: “Indeed we should not have any more of it, from either police officers or former police officers, this kind of infantile discussion that goes on.”

Kirkham later appeared to dispute having used the term, posting a message which said: “Genuinely don’t recall doing so ’a couple of days ago’!”",BBC to be investigated over Tory MP’s live TV swearing,http://www.theguardian.com,[Press Association],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402913331817/Nick-Herbert-012.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=eaa7d361b97c6509f69a20454744a322,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/16/bbc-tory-mp-tv-swearing-nick-herbert-daily-politics

981,"They say I owe the Co-operative Bank £104 but no one will tell me why

Last year I received a letter from Moorcroft, a company I had never heard of, saying that I owed the Co-operative Bank £104.17 and that they had been authorised to secure payment. I wrote to both to say that I was unaware of owing any such sum and asking for clarification.

I had a Co-op credit card years ago but paid off the balance in 2004 and destroyed the card. The last communication I had was a statement dated 2005 showing the balance as nil.

I received no reply to my letters until I was notified that the debt had been transferred to another company, Fredrickson International and was told that ""all communication must be"" with them.

There was no information as to what the money was due to. If it is a case of fraud one would expect the sum to be much higher, but the bank does not appear interested in discussing it. BM, Kington, Herefordshire

The origins of the mystery lie in the fact that you never formally cancelled your credit card; you simply stopped using it and assumed it had become dormant. In fact, these cards can take on a life of their own if you have previously set up what's known as a continuing payment authority. It turns out you had one in favour of the RAC on the card account. This settled the RAC payments until last year.

The reason you didn't receive statements is that you moved house after abandoning the Co-op and the paperwork was sent to your old address.

The Co-op should have explained this to you when you queried the debt and it's now waiving it and updating your damaged credit file by way of apology. It has also cancelled the recurring transaction on the card.

Always make sure an account is formally cancelled, along with any regular payments, rather than allowing it to go dormant.

983,"We booked online but when we arrived we discovered we couldn't cross the border

We have a house in France not far from the Spanish border. In February I booked return flights to Girona in Spain, as Ryanair does not fly to Perpignan in winter.

As usual, I clicked on Ryanair's website to book car hire through Hertz and found myself redirected to Firefly Car Rental. I was suspicious and called Hertz, who told me that Firefly was a subsidiary and that the terms and conditions would be the same.

I went ahead and booked. But when we arrived at Girona, there was a makeshift sign on the desk where Hertz used to be, saying Firefly.

In front of us were another British couple who were being told that Firefly cars were not insured for France and if they chose to drive over the border they would be doing so uninsured.

We were told the same story. The assistant was almost in tears and I got the impression that she had been telling this story to a number of unhappy customers. We cancelled and hired a car through Europcar.

I have been charged very little but I'm concerned that many people holidaying in France will book their car through Firefly, only to discover that their booking is worthless because they cannot drive across the border. SL, Buckinghamshire

Hertz, which used to allow forays into France for no extra charge, has withdrawn from Girona airport and left the field clear for its budget subsidiary, Firefly. The blanket restriction on crossing borders is unusual.

""Generally, rental companies are happy for customers to drive rental vehicles across Europe, though they may charge for this,"" says a spokesman for the British Vehicle Leasing & Rental Association.

Firefly has finally twigged and tells me that, as of 1 April, it now offers extra insurance at a daily rate for customers who wish to cross to France.

All most promising … except that the terms and conditions on its website still state categorically that travel outside Spain is a breach of contract. According to Firefly this is due to a ""delay"" in updating the website. The terms and conditions on the Ryanair booking form were unavailable when I tried. Online review sites suggest that this issue is not the company's only deficiency.

Always read the small print before committing (if you can find it!).

985,"In the next instalment on our series on what to do with your pension money now you don't have to buy an annuity, we look at the best route for those entitled to benefits

Anyone on a low income who has a maturing personal pension needs to consider carefully how the decisions they make about their pension fund will affect their entitlement to means-tested benefits – in particular pension credit, housing benefit, the ""support for mortgage interest"" (SMI) scheme and council tax reduction, the new name for council tax benefit.

The income and capital thresholds, cut-offs and tapers for these vary, so the calculation is far from straightforward.

The examples below will show that in many cases such people will be much better off taking only a £10,000 lump sum – the threshold above which capital is taken into account for pension credit calculations – and using the rest to buy an annuity.

How it might work in practice

Let's take as an example a single 65-year-old man living in Derby, who has a full basic state pension (currently £113.10 a week), is living in rented social housing paying £65 a week, and has a pension fund of £40,000.

If he keeps £10,000 as a lump sum and converts the rest into an annuity of £27.27 a week – the amount that was thrown up when his details were keyed into a randomly chosen annuity website – he will get some pension credit and full housing benefit and council tax reduction: ie, all his rent and council tax will be paid. His total income (state pension, annuity, pension credit, housing benefit and council tax reduction) will be £238 a week.

If he decides instead to take the whole pot as a lump sum, he will get pension credit of £6.90 a week, but no housing benefit or council tax reduction, and his weekly income will be £120 – a reduction of £118. His investment income from the lump sum will provide only a fraction of this, and to maintain the same standard of living as he would have with the annuity, he will have to work his way through his savings. As his lump sum drops, his benefit entitlement will gradually increase. For example, when his savings have dropped to £10,000, his total income, including pension credit, housing benefit and council tax reduction, will increase to £226.

Spending most of the lump sum to reduce his capital to the £10,000 level is unlikely to help, since he will probably be considered to have ""deliberately deprived"" himself of capital to qualify for benefit and will then be treated as if he still has it. His income will remain at £120 a week. So unless he is sure of dying within a relatively short time, the annuity looks like the best option.

Our man might wonder why he bothered to save in the first place since his income is only £12 more than if he hadn't saved at all, or had saved only £10,000. He will have to live for a very long time to recoup the £30,000, so he might have been better to have spent it while he could without penalty.

If you rent privately

For a similar individual living in private rented housing in an area where rents are high, the difference is even starker. In London's Hackney, the local housing allowance for a one-bedroom property, which is the maximum amount that will be paid in housing benefit, is £254 a week. If someone uses £30,000 to buy a weekly annuity of £27.27 as above, his total weekly income, including pension credit, housing benefit and council tax reduction, will be £427. If he takes his whole pension pot as a lump sum, his weekly income will remain at £120 – a reduction of £307 a week. His income will increase to £415 when his savings drop to £10,000.

If you are a homeowner

A pensioner who owns their home will not be entitled to housing benefit but may still get pension credit and council tax reduction. If they buy the £27.27 a week annuity their weekly income, including pension credit and council tax reduction, will be £172 – while if they take the whole lot as a lump sum their income will be £120, increasing to £160 when their lump sum falls to £10,000.

Leaving the money in the pension fund will not help, as this will be treated as savings as far as means-tested benefits are concerned. The pensioner should also take into account that benefits are inflation-linked, whereas the annuity and lump sum in this example are not.

Anyone in this position should take advice. Citizens advice bureaux can provide information about benefit entitlement but cannot give investment advice. There are a range of websites, such as entitledto.co.uk, that can help with benefit calculations. A financial adviser would hopefully be able to provide benefit calculations and can give investment advice.

987,"With a growing number of travel insurers looking for your business, how do you find the one that meets your needs?

You've booked the holiday, updated your summer wardrobe and checked the neighbours will water the plants. But have you bought travel insurance? If you are one of the millions turning to price-comparison sites to search for a policy the choice can seem baffling.

Cash logged into Moneysupermarket.com to search for a Europe-only annual policy to cover two adults and two children under 16. It offered 94 policies from just £22.80. The same search on Gocompare.com returned 95, from £24.64. The startlingly low prices are thanks to intense competition among an expanding list of providers.

However, table-topping names were mostly unrecognisable. We scrolled past a dozen or so before coming across a well-known brand. So how do you know you are buying from a reputable company?

Large insurers tend to trade under a range of different names, and an unknown brand could actually be backed by a company you have heard of. For example, Travelinsurance.co.uk is a trading name of InsureandGo, which is part of massive Spanish insurer Mapfre. You can check the ""about us"" section of a provider's website to see who they are. ""Picking one that is part of a big insurer should give you peace of mind,"" says Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers.

There is a handful of standalone players, including Explorer Travel Insurance, Traveltime, Starttravel.co.uk, Planet Earth and goPanda. ""In this case check who underwrites the policy – this is the company paying in the event of a claim,"" says Tarling.

If you are buying through a comparison site, the brands are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and you are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

In the unfortunate event you pick a small brand and it goes bust, the scheme will step in. ""We may first try to transfer the policy to another insurer,"" says a spokesman. ""If there is a claim already in process, we may be able to offer compensation, but this would be on a case-by-case basis.""

Whether a provider pays out is what consumers really want to know. The Financial Ombudsman Service received, on average, 43 complaints a week in the year to April 2014, ruling in favour of the consumer in more than half the cases.

One of the most common reasons for a claim being rejected is when an insurer relies on a particularly restrictive or onerous term in the contract.

A spokesman for the ombudsman says: ""Should the worst happen, keep a note of any correspondence. Keep electronic copies of your policy saved to your email account so the documents can be accessed wherever you are in the world. Taking pictures of an incident is another great way to record what's happened.""

Complaint disputes make it important to consider how companies deal with customers. Look for 24-hour helplines, and check online forums to see if there are any comments about a brand.

Gocompare.com offers star ratings beside policies from independent financial researcher Defaqto. Some of the cheapest are only awarded one star out of a possible five. Consumer ratings are also a useful way of understanding which companies look after their customers. Of 20 travel insurers listed by consumer group Which? it only recommends Saga and Marks & Spencer Bank based on customer feedback.

Fairer Finance, a service set up to help consumers choose the best financial products, ranks insurers based on what customers think of the brand, how good they are at handling complaints, and how transparent they are. The best score highly across all of these areas.

Among travel insurers LV=, First Direct, Tesco, Amex, M&S and Saga are gold-rated, while Aviva, HSBC, Staysure and the AA are silver-rated.

""It's worth going to a comparison site first to see what the cheapest available policies are – but if you don't see any of these brands it could be worth going to them directly,"" says James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance.

Before any search make a list of what cover you need in a policy, says Tarling. If you are unsure if the policy will pay out for your needs, you could also call a broker. A list of these is available at biba.org.uk. They can advise you of the right policy for your requirements.

Graeme Trudgill, executive director of the British Insurance Brokers' Association, says: ""Numerous brands listed on comparison sites are actually brokers. You could give them a call to check the policy definitely covers your needs – they will have different types and strip down the cover to get a competitive quote.""

Here are some relatively unknown insurers that may crop up: ■ Staysure: This is a specialist insurance broker for the over-50s known for being prepared to cover holidaymakers with cancer or other serious pre-existing medical conditions. Staysure has above average happiness and trust scores from customers on Fairer Finance – in spite of having the longest policy document of all travel insurers (at almost 38,000 words).

■ BigBlue Cover: Listed by Which? as offering attractive rates with a good level of cover for singles, family and couples. It is part of the larger Rock Insurance Group.

■ TopDog Insurance: Surprisingly, it isn't a pet insurer. Cover is underwritten by Mapfre, which has a below average record on complaints handling, says Fairer Finance. In the last six months of 2013, the Financial Ombudsman received 310 complaints about Mapfre compared to 115 for Saga. Its policy documents are among the longest – at a little over 25,000 words.

■ Explorer Travel Insurance: It specialises in insurance cover for over 65s. It is listed by Which? as providing among the best value European single trip policies for those over 80 with a good level of cover.",Travel insurance: pick your way to the best policy,http://www.theguardian.com,[Harriet Meyer],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Money/Pix/gallery/2014/6/6/1402062941493/Cala-Comtessa--008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=39d95d2e4fe57834a9c3da060b9efd08,2014-06-09 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/09/travel-insurance-pick-best-policy
989,"An appeal court ruling over compensation for a 27-hour flight delay could open the floodgates for thousands of air passengers claiming for holdups caused by technical difficulties.

Lawyers said almost 20m passengers who experienced delays or cancellations over the past six years could be eligible to bring a claim after an appeal court judge ruled that Jet2.com should compensate Ronald Huzar for the delay he experienced on a flight from Malaga to Manchester in 2011.

The airline said there had been a technical problem that meant it did not have to pay compensation under rules that cover ""extraordinary circumstances"". Typically, the term refers to poor weather or political unrest.

Huzar took his case to Manchester county court, which ruled in his favour. Jet2.com lodged an appeal, taking the case all the way to the high court. The appeal was refused and Huzar was yesterday awarded £526 compensation.

David Bott, an aviation lawyer at Bott & Co, who represented Huzar, said around 90% of the 15,000 flight delay claims on its books have been refused because of technical defects.

Jet2.com said the judgment was disappointing and could, if unchallenged, ""have a significant impact on the entire airline industry"".

A spokesman said it would take the dispute to the supreme court. ""We will continue to seek clarity and consistency by appealing directly to a higher court."" He added that the airline regretted any inconvenience to passengers.

Flight delay claims are subject to the UK's statute of limitations, which allows claims to date back six years. The law for flight delay compensation, clarified in October 2012, applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into Europe on an EU–based airline.

Guy Anker from MoneySavingExpert.com said: ""We haven't got all the ins and outs, but anyone that was previously rejected should re-submit their claim to get the ball rolling..""

991,"Pensions industry writes to chancellor pushing for decisions to be made quickly on how pension pot plan will be delivered

Plans to offer free, impartial retirement guidance will be at risk unless the government urgently makes some key decisions, the pensions industry warns in a letter sent on Wednesday to the chancellor, George Osborne.

The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) want the government ""to make some fundamental decisions quickly,"" they write, to ensure that the offer of face-to-face guidance, which was announced as part of the radical pensions shake-up in the budget, can be delivered by the April 2015 deadline.

Thousands of people approaching retirement will be given greater freedom over how they use their pension pot from next April, and guidance is intended to help people make vital decisions about what they do with their nest eggs. The ABI and the NAPF raised fears over an ""unnerving lack of detail"" about how the guarantee will be delivered.

Otto Thoresen, the ABI's director general, said: ""The industry fully supports the government's intention to provide free, impartial guidance to savers on their options as from next April.

""But time is not on our side. No one should underestimate the work that needs to be done to make this a reality, which is why the government have some urgent decisions to make.""

The NAPF chief executive, Joanne Segars, said: ""The budget announcement was nearly three months ago and there remains an unnerving lack of detail from the government about how the 'guidance guarantee' will be delivered.""","Retirement guidance pledge at risk, George Osborne is warned",http://www.theguardian.com,[John Mcternan],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/10/1402425464604/Retirement-guidance-pledg-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=f3f03f394163859c45a8066634e78f0a,2014-06-11 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/11/retirement-pensions-guidance-pledge-risk-george-osborne
993,"I am hitting a brick wall with Virgin Media. I organised the broadband and TV service for a shared house in Norwich. When I was leaving last summer I was told by Virgin how to transfer the service to the remaining tenants.

Unbeknown to me, this incurred a charge of £48 as it involved terminating the old contract and starting a new one. When I queried this I was told that I had been misinformed and that there was an alternative which would not have resulted in a charge.

They offered to look into the matter. Either way, there was no loss of income for Virgin Media as the service was simply transferred. I heard nothing, then received a further demand. I wrote again – still nothing. Five months later I received a forwarded ""notice of intention to commence debt collection action"" from an agency.

I have asked Virgin Media to reconsider and advised the agency of this. I have no confidence that it will respond. I am unemployed (now on an unpaid internship in Europe) and cannot afford what I think is an unfair charge. JL, c/o Peterborough, Cambs

997,"Ombudsman says that despite strong resistance from the industry, it may ask insurers to pay claims for cancelled holidays

Holidaymakers who are forced to cancel their holiday because of lengthy delays in processing their passport may be able to reclaim the costs of their trip through their travel insurance policy – even if their insurer tells them otherwise.

The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which deals with disputes between consumers and financial companies, said that it may ask an insurer to pay the claim for a cancelled holiday as long as the policyholder had ""done all they reasonably could to chase the passport application"" and had ""put in their passport application in far in advance of the deadlines laid down by the passport office"".

""If they [the holidaymaker] were still unable to travel due to the delays, then we would be looking for the insurer to act in the spirit of the insurance policy,"" said a spokeswoman for the FOS.

It said that, as an indication, if the deadline was four weeks and somebody had applied for their passport seven to eight weeks in advance, it may expect insurers to pay out. Currently, the Passport Service website advises consumers that it takes three weeks to process an application.

The Ombudsman's stance is significant because the insurance industry remains adamant that holidaymakers, some of whom have reportedly suffered delays of months in waiting for a passport, can not turn to their insurers to cover them for cancellation of their trip.

On Wednesday the Association of British Insurers said that ""policies are not designed to cover cancellation due to delays in obtaining a passport"".

The British Insurance Brokers Association also said that it would not expect insurers to cover this situation. ""Travel insurance policies mention the specific perils that are covered and those that are excluded when it comes to delays or cancellation, and we have never come across a policy that includes delays in getting your passport,"" said Graeme Trudgill, head of corporate affairs at Biba.

Aviva, the UK's largest insurer, said: ""There is no cover on your travel policy if you have to cancel your trip because you haven't received your passport in time.""

ESure also said it would categorically not cover delays in obtaining a passport. ""It is laid out in the terms of our insurance that we cannot cover you for lack of a valid passport or visa.""

However, even where an insurer does refuse cover because of the wording of its policy, a spokeswoman for FOS said a policyholder who felt the stance was unfair should approach the ombudsman.

""As ever with these things, just because the insurer may give you a reason it doesn't necessarily mean that it's fair,"" she said. ""This [the current delays in processing passport applications] is a situation so far out of a holidaymaker's control that we would expect insurers to take a more holisitic view when considering claims.""",Passport delays: holidaymakers may be able to claim on travel insurance,http://www.theguardian.com,[Lisa Bachelor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402575884766/A-family-on-a-beach-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=a188ebed6d2380493f2260abe8c2710a,2014-06-12 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/12/passport-delays-holidaymakers-claim-insurance
999,"We grill the experts for their tips to help you shop for a barbecue without getting your fingers burned

With the summer sun beating down there is nothing finer than alfresco cooking. If you are going to use your barbecue regularly then investing in the right one can improve your cooking experience.

We grilled some experts for their tips, to help you shop for a barbecue without getting your fingers burned.

Prices range from around £10 to more than £3,000, depending on the size of your chosen grill, the number of features it boasts and the quality of its construction.

However, Toby Shea from the British BBQ Society says the price tag is not solely a guide to quality. ""Feel the product and if one is considerably heavier than another it means it is made with better steel,"" he says. ""Porcelain-coated charcoal barbecues are good as they tend to offer better resistance to heat and scratches and are harder wearing.""

Gas or charcoal?

The main choice involves how you want to cook your food: over gas or charcoal. Your budget might make your mind up for you, as gas machines tend to be more expensive.

Charcoal barbecues require more time to get going as the embers need to be piping hot to cook the food properly, although if you invest in a chimney starter you can speed up the process be cooking in 15 minutes.

Shea suggests avoiding self-lighting charcoal as it is impregnated with chemicals to get started and designed to heat up quickly, but also die quickly.

The taste from a charcoal barbecue is distinctive. ""You can really taste the difference of food cooked on chargrilled wood, because it is cooked slower it keeps the moisture in, making the meat more succulent,"" says Dave Squires owner of Barbecue Chefs. Shea suggests that with a gas barbecue you can mimic the flavour profile of charcoal by using wood-chips in foil with holes in it, but there is still a difference in taste.

Gas barbecues allow you to start cooking almost immediately. As the temperature is regulated, gas tends to cook more evenly than charcoal. On some machines with multiple burners you can cook food at different temperatures. This is handy for foods that require varying heat intensities.

The cost to run



With gas you often ""rent"" the cylinder, with companies then charging each time for the gas you purchase. A typical cost for gas-only is around £30 for 13kg, which should give around 12 hours' cooking time.

A typical 7kg bag of charcoal should cost between £7 and £10 and provide enough fuel for up to three medium barbecues.

Other considerations



Many barbecues come without a hood, but it is worth looking for one that does have a lid, says Shea. ""It makes it a lot more versatile than an open grill,"" he says. ""You can control the heat more, cooking food throughout rather than burning the outside and leaving it raw on the inside.""

With a gas barbecue you have multiple burners, Shea suggests going for a minimum of three. You can have two burning and leave the heat off one, put your meat over the direct heat giving it a bit of colour, then move it over to the burner that is off, closing the lid and the heat inside the barbecue should cook it without burning.

With charcoal, it's a similar process; you fill one side with charcoal, initially cook the food under it, moving it to the other side and closing the top to heat throughout. A food thermometer is a useful addition to ensure the food is properly cooked.

When considering the size of barbecue think about what you're going to cook. Shea says, ""The trend is people are cooking large lumps of meat and a standard size grill is perfectly adequate."" If you are going to cook plenty of burgers and sausages for a big group you may want a bigger grill space. For the largest of parties a barbecue with a warming rack could be useful to keep ""ready to eat"" food warm while continuing cooking.

If you are intending to use food that would possibly slip through the grill (slithers of meat, vegetables or even eggs) then a model with a griddle may be useful. Other models have side burners for sauces, boiling potatoes or vegetables. A gas barbecue would benefit from an adequate area for grease collection when cleaning.

Also consider the practicalities, such as where you will store the barbecue when not in use. If it is placed outside a fitted cover is a good investment.

1001,"Legislation aims to clarify cancellation rights and give customers who shop online or by phone more time to return products

British consumers will have more time to return an item bought online, by phone or at home under a package of tougher rights that come into force on Friday.

In what is being hailed as the biggest shakeup of consumer protection laws in a generation, shoppers will be given 14 days, rather than the current seven, to return an item. They will also no longer be forced to pay premium rate phone numbers when telephoning retailers' customer service phone lines about something they have bought. Retailers will now have to offer a number that is charged at standard call rates.

The Consumer Rights Directive will apply in all 28 EU member states from Friday. The new legislation aims to clarify information rights and cancellation rights, and to prohibit some hidden cost practices when consumers buy certain goods and services.

""The Consumer Rights Directive will give people greater protection against rogue traders and strengthen their rights when shopping online,"" said Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd. ""These changes, coupled with the new consumer bill of rights, will give people more power to challenge bad practice.""

In the UK the directive is being implemented through the Consumer Contracts Regulations and replaces the Distance Selling Regulations and Doorstep Selling Regulations. They are separate from the consumer rights bill – which contains further protective measures – currently going through parliament.

Further changes in the new regulations include a ban on ""pre-ticked"" boxes for payment of additional services, such as travel insurance, when buying a holiday, and on excessive ""administrative"" credit and debit card surcharges on flights and concert bookings. However, some contracts are excluded from the scope of the new regulations – notably financial services, package travel and gambling.

Consumer minister Jenny Willott said: ""What we want to see are empowered, savvy shoppers who know their rights, look around for the best deals and drive competition.""

Justin Edgar of London law firm Harbottle & Lewis added: ""The regulations herald the beginning of what it is expected to be biggest shake-up of consumer protection laws in a generation. They will put considerable new responsibilities on traders in relation to just about everything in the business to consumer relationship..""",Consumer rights shakeup offers online shoppers more protection,http://www.theguardian.com,[Rebecca Smithers],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/25/1398418308201/Online-shopping-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=fbc9ddef9a28c2f16bb54dda21c6b49e,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/13/consumer-rights-shakeup-online-shoppers-protection
1003,"Survey reveals 37% of British consumers are willing to use sites such as Airbnb, but still trail behind their international peers

More than a third of British consumers are willing to tap into the growing phenomenon of the sharing economy in which people use specialist websites to rent out their personal assets – from homes, cars, sports equipment and even power tools – according to research.

Yet when it comes to the international league, more reticent Britons are only half as willing as their peers elsewhere on the globe to hire out their personal possessions.

The results of the major study by Nielsen, a global provider of information and insights into what consumers watch and buy, highlights the rising global trend in ""micro-entrepreneurs"", fuelled by the internet, and the trend for renting items rather than buying them outright.

The Nielsen Global Survey of Share Communities – which polled more than 30,000 internet respondents in 60 countries – reveals that despite the desire of 37% of Britons to embrace the phenomenon, they trail behind the 54% of Europeans and 68% of people globally who would do the same. Within Europe, southern countries tend to be the most willing to use the sharing economy, ahead of northern and eastern Europe, while western countries tend to be the least willing to participate.

Also known as peer-to-peer rental, the sharing economy – whose profile has been raised by enterprises such as the short-term property rental site Airbnb – enables people to capitalise on the unused capacity of personal assets, by renting them out to fellow consumers for income.

As well as ""peer-to-peer"" websites such as Zopa, which lends money directly to borrowers, there are others such as EasyCar Club, which allow car owners to hire out their car to a complete stranger in return for around £30 a day. Women wanting to rent party dresses rather than buy them has fuelled the popularity of websites such as Girl Meets Dress.

Within Europe, southern countries tend to be the most willing to use the sharing economy, ahead of northern and eastern Europe, while western countries tend to be the least willing to participate.

Chris Morley, Nielsen group managing director for UK and Ireland, said: ""While some British consumers have embraced the sharing economy, fewer of us in the UK have bought into it than people in, say, southern Europe, Latin America, Asia or Africa.

He added: ""The reasons may be purely financial – after all, the UK enjoys relatively higher wealth than these parts of the world – so the option of self-ownership is more available to us. But you can't help feeling the stereotype of British reserve may still play a part in our reticence to feel completely comfortable sharing our lives and assets.""

While men and women in the UK are equally likely to rent out their personal items, women are more reluctant to rent from others. The willingness to do so decreases with age – 56% of people under 30 are keen, compared to just 13% of people over 60. The most popular assets likely to be offered are: services/lessons, power tools and cars. One in nine (11%) are willing to rent out their home.

The sharing economy has not been without controversy, however. Uber has run into problems in the UK – sparking a protest by London black cab drivers this week – with its claim that it isn't a taxi firm, but a ""ride sharing"" company, doing little more than connecting drivers with passengers. And San Francisco-based Airbnb has in London fallen foul of rules that require landlords to apply for planning permission from the council to rent out their homes for less than three months. The government said earlier this week that it plans to abolish this law.",More than a third of Britons embrace the sharing economy,http://www.theguardian.com,"[Rebecca Smithers, Dan Gillmor In Barcelona]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402657949192/Taxi-protest-against-Uber-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=5a8525a5706fe264acbba1bb2c2d359a,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/13/third-of-britons-embrace-sharing-economy
1005,"Leaving the workforce early can lead to poverty, as well as boredom and loneliness, according to government research

Stopping work 10 years short of the retirement age could cost someone more than a third of their pension pot, according to the government.

It can also have a major impact on people's mental health, leading to ""boredom, loneliness and poverty"" and create a huge dent in the British economy.

The findings are part of the research behind a new ""action plan"" to get older people back into work, launched by pensions minister Steve Webb. The report, Fuller Working Lives, concluded that the British economy missed out on £18bn last year because people left the workforce early.

The report focuses on those who have been forced to leave the workforce, largely through redundancy or ill health, rather than those who have chosen to retire in their 50s because they can afford to do so.

Webb said: ""We need to act now and focus in the first instance on preventing individuals' catastrophic withdrawal from the labour market, and where we cannot, support older workers to re-enter the world of employment.""

""We owe it to those people who might otherwise be left behind. People like the person in their 50s who wants to work, but cannot because they have caring responsibilities, or the worker who can no longer do their strenuous manual job because they have a bad back.""

The report gave the example of ""David"", a worker earning just under £30,000 a year, saving, with his employer, 8% of this into a pension. Working from age 25 until his state pension age of 65 he could expect to accumulate a pension pot of £128,000. If he stopped working, and contributing, at age 55, his pension pot would be more than a third smaller – approximately £81,000.

The new measures being put in place by the government include extending the right to request flexible working to all employees in June 2014; the appointment of an ""employment champion"", who will promote the benefits of an older workforce to the business community; and the launch of a new service that will give workers with long-term health problems support to stay in or return to work.

While the UK employment rate for 55-64-year-olds is around 60% and growing, according to the latest labour market data, people leaving work before state pension age is still seen as a significant problem.

On average, men leave the labour market earlier now than they did in the 1950s and 1960s, often due to circumstances beyond their control. Of the 2.9 million people of state pension age who are out of work, only 0.7 million see themselves as ""retired"", said the report, yet 1.7 million think it is unlikely that they will ever work again.",Workers who retire 10 years early could lose third of their pension,http://www.theguardian.com,[Lisa Bachelor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/22/1395505016028/Pensions-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=53fc1acd4e6566e158fc4dfcb98a4693,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/13/workers-retire-early-lose-third-pension
1007,"Police are warning of 'courier fraud', where victims dial their bank's number and speak to 'staff' who persuade them to part with huge sums of money

It starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be from your bank, and can end with the loss of £40,000 or more. It's one of the most sophisticated bank frauds police have seen – one that targets older women in well-off areas. The banks know it is going on but are refusing to reimburse victims. So why have there been so few warnings about this scam?

That's the question the family of Cecily Grange* were asking this week. The 76-year-old from Windsor lost £23,000 earlier this year after two conmen persuaded her they were calling from her local Barclays branch, and that she needed to move her savings to a ""new account"" that staff had supposedly set up.

In a separate incident, Oxford woman Mary Wilson* lost £7,000 in similar circumstances. In her case, she handed the cash to a courier who arrived at her door. Wilson believed she was helping to track and capture bank staff who were stealing customers' money, while Grange thought she was moving her savings to prevent fraud.

Both women were rung up out of the blue and told that their bank suspected they had been victims of fraud. They were invited to call the bank back, using the phone number on the back of their debit card. Having dialled the bank's number, the victims assumed they were speaking to bank staff – but in both cases the conmen had kept the line open. Many people are unaware that a phone line can remain open for up to five minutes after the handset has been put down by the person receiving the call, enabling fraudsters to stay on the line to impersonate a victim's bank.

Police say scammers have refined ""courier fraud"" into a fine art. This month, City of London police revealed that 2,556 courier fraud offences were reported to the Metropolitan police between April 2013 and March 2014. This is a nationwide problem: since February, Greater Manchester police has recorded 346 offences, while in one of the cases investigated by Devon and Cornwall police, the victim lost £40,000.

In its simplest form, courier fraud is where scammers phone the victim, purporting to be from their bank, the police, or another law enforcement agency. They then dupe the person into withdrawing a large sum and handing it to a courier or taxi driver, who may not know they are being used as part of the scam.

Often, the victim is asked to assist with a police investigation, or told there is a corrupt member of staff in the bank and asked for help to identify them. The victim is told the money will be ""marked"" and collected. They may be asked to ring the number on the back of their card, convincing them the call is genuine.

In Grange's case, the caller rang her in February to say that someone had siphoned £1,000 out of her accounts and asked whether she had authorised the transactions. Greatly alarmed, she was persuaded she must immediately transfer her remaining balance into a new account that had been set up for her.

Her family says she was not asked for her pin, and knew not to give it to anyone. The conmen were so convincing that they persuaded Grange – who suffers from poor health and requires a stick to go any distance – to walk from her flat to her Barclays branch in Windsor. There, she stuck to the line she had been given that she was not to discuss the matter with the cashiers, as they might be the fraudsters.

Grange's daughter, who contacted Guardian Money, has questioned why staff – who, she says, would have been aware of the scam – did nothing to stop her mother as she emptied her current and savings accounts and sent the total of £23,000 to a TSB account, an account into which she had never paid any money previously. Barclays has told her it is not liable for the losses.

""I appreciate Barclays could well argue they have no obligation to reimburse my mother, as it was not a fraud involving a credit or debit card, nor did it involve a third party withdrawing funds from her account. However, she did so because she genuinely believed Barclays had instructed her to, and because she was too elderly and unwell to realise she was being duped,"" says Grange's daughter.

Mary Wilson's case is similar. She was persuaded to withdraw £7,000 by fraudsters who rang her Oxford home at the end of January while her husband was on business. In her case she was told to take the money out of the couple's joint account in cash, and to hand it over to a courier, who would come to her home.

Again, she was told not to answer any questions as to why she was taking out such a large sum. She was repeatedly reassured that once the sting had been enacted, her money – marked and followed by police – would be returned, and that she was being a great help to the authorities. NatWest, her bank, has told her it will not refund her losses.

The figures, for London only, show the average age of a victim was aged 54, and nearly two thirds of victims were female. The average loss was around £2,600. Last week, the Met police launched a Courier Fraud Awareness Day, but failed to tell anyone. Guardian Money only came across it while researching this article. The campaign has been backed by Barclays and Natwest, as well as Santander. The Met police insists much has been done in the last year to tackle courier fraud, but adds that this crime ""continues to evolve … we want people to question even truly genuine-sounding calls and, most importantly, remember police and banks will never ask for your pin or bank card, so you should never give these away.""

A spokesman for Barclays says its staff constantly try to strike a balance between honouring customers' wishes to withdraw their own money, and doing their utmost to prevent fraud. In Grange's case, staff identified her using chip and pin technology, and an identification and verification checklist was completed, it says.

""Staff are trained to be alert to unusually large transactions, but there are also situations in which a transaction appears unusual but the customer would like it to go ahead for valid reasons. Our guidance highlights key warning signs branch staff should look for, and encourages them to tactfully ask the customer why the transaction is required. At the time [we] concluded that the funds were required for a genuine purpose. Therefore we are unable to reimburse these funds,"" he says.

A spokeswoman for NatWest confirmed it will not refund Wilson as she had ""willingly handed over the money"". ""We would advise all our customers to be extra vigilant and in the case of suspicious or unexpected calls, always verify the caller using an independently checked telephone number and using a different phone line.""

These cases may help explain why – as reported by Money last month – HSBC has been asking some customers making large cash withdrawals to provide documentary evidence of what the money is needed for. At the time the bank said it was to ""reduce the risk of money laundering, fraud and other crimes"".

Regulator Ofcom says it is working with the police and the telecoms industry to help stamp out courier fraud, and adds: ""Over the past year a number of telephone providers have made changes to their networks to cut the time a phone line remains open to a couple of seconds. This has stopped fraudsters being able to stay on the line to impersonate a victim's bank or the police.""

1009,"In the latest instalment of our series on what to do with your pension money now you don't have to buy an annuity, we look at where to get advice

George Osborne's decision to give retiring workers a free hand with their pension savings from next year makes it more important than ever that people get the right advice on what to do with the money.

In March the chancellor announced he is scrapping the rules that in effect forced people to buy an annuity with their pension pot. The new regime comes into force in April 2015 and will affect the 320,000 people who retire each year with defined contribution pensions. From that date, it looks likely that retiring savers will continue to be able to take 25% of their pot tax-free, and access the rest of their money as cash. But they will have to pay tax on that at their marginal rate – either 0%, 20%, 40% or 45%.

The government also made the bold promise that, to help people make the decision that best suits their needs, ""everyone with a defined contribution pension will be offered free and impartial face-to-face guidance on the range of options available to them at retirement"". Osborne said in March that he was providing £20m over the next two years to develop this, but virtually no information has so far been issued on how this advice regime will work – what it will cover, who will provide the guidance, and so on.

This week the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) said there was ""an unnerving lack of detail"", while the Association of British Insurers warned that ""time is not on our side … the government has some urgent decisions to make"". However, the Treasury says it has only just finished consulting on this issue and will respond before 22 July.

The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group says the £20m over two years that the government is offering works out at about £30 per retiree, which is ""clearly inadequate"". Obviously, we need to wait and see who will provide this free guidance and where it will be delivered.

Workplace-based advice Experts reckon many more companies will introduce workplace-based advice for employees faced with tough choices at retirement.

Around half of the 1,300 pension schemes that are members of the NAPF already offer their employees guidance, which can take the form of anything from online support and seminars to professional one-to-one advice that may, or may not, be paid for by the employer.

Graeme Bold, workplace proposition director at Standard Life, which provides support to many big-name employers and pension schemes, says: ""It's such a big decision for people to make. For a lot of people, that support might be education and facts and information. For others with more complex needs, financial advisers play a very important role."" But he says it is not just a conversation you can have at one point in time, such as shortly before you are due to retire – it's about getting people to think about the issues and options in the years running up to their expected retirement date.

Financial advisers Many people with bigger pension pots and/or more complicated finances will probably want specialist advice. Industry figures indicate that just a fifth of Britons have consulted an independent financial adviser, according to the friendly society LV=.

The best way to find a financial adviser is to ask trusted friends and colleagues for a recommendation. Alternatively, go to unbiased.co.uk, which describes itself as the UK's most comprehensive professional adviser search website. It allows people to search for advisers in their area who specialise in the financial issues they are facing. But expect to pay at least a few hundred pounds – and possibly a lot more.

All firms now either charge upfront fees averaging around £150 an hour, or a percentage fee of the sum invested. If your pension pot is relatively small, you may want to opt for an adviser who charges a percentage fee. For larger funds it's probably best to seek out someone who charges per hour.

Other sources of advice There are free DIY resources on the web, such as the Money Advice Service, which is independent and set up by the government.

There is also the Pensions Advisory Service, an independent non-profit organisation providing free information and advice on company, personal and stakeholder schemes. It has a general helpline (0845 601 2923), one for women (0845 600 0806) and one for the self-employed (0845 602 7021), all open 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday, plus a web chat facility.",Confused about your pension?

1011,"Theme parks such as Alton Towers and Chessington can swallow hundreds of pounds – but there are ways to cut the cost

The sunny weather is here at last, but succumbing to the siren call of Britain's theme parks could swallow up several hundred pounds – once you factor in getting there, the overpriced food, photos of the kids coming down the water chute, ice creams and soft toys. So how can you keep the cost down?

Book ahead

Buying entry tickets on the day is almost always more expensive than booking in advance. For a family of four at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, the total gate price is £165.60, whereas booking online would cost £124.20. It's a similar story at Legoland Windsor (£176.40 versus £132.30) and Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey (£132 versus £120, or £96 if you grab the early bird tickets).

If you are simply accompanying others, but don't want to use the rides yourself, check for a reduced price. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, for example, charges £6 for an entry pass plus access to the maze, a water show and the Pleasure Beach Express, in contrast to £19.99 for a peak-time adult wristband, booked ahead online, allowing an unlimited number of rides during one day's visit.

Grab a two-for-one deal

Find deals on websites such as TopDogDays.com or MoneySavingExpert.com. Available now, for example, are vouchers on selected Kellogg's cereals, which can be used this summer at 27 attractions allowing one adult free entry with each full-price child or adult ticket.

Note that a few attractions, such as Paultons Park and Peppa Pig World in Hampshire, do not accept these discounts .

Cash in your loyalty points

Loyalty points can be cashed in for days out. Tesco Clubcard holders, for example, can convert their voucher points into tokens, worth up to five times the vouchers' face value, towards entry into many UK attractions.

At the time of writing, £2 in Clubcard vouchers will get you £10 of tokens towards entry at attractions including Sea Life centres, London Zoo, Fantasy Island in Skegness and Dinosaur Isle on the Isle of Wight, while £12.50 in vouchers can be exchanged for a one-day ticket to Legoland Windsor, or £28 in vouchers for a Legoland premium annual pass allowing unlimited visits.

Meanwhile, from 23 July to 12 August, Nectar loyalty points will be worth up to quadruple their usual value when used on tickets to attractions.

Take a package

A short-break package can sometimes offer good value if you plan to spend a couple of days at a park. A family of four with two paying children (those under one metre high go free), for example, visiting Paultons Park and Peppa Pig World on 5 and 6 August, would normally pay £90 a day for family tickets booked in advance - a total of £180 just for entry. But for £243, they could buy a overnight package including two days' entry to the park, a night in a family room at the park's partner hotel, the Marriott Meon Valley, 18 miles away from Peppa and her mates, plus breakfast.

The same family would pay £226 for a two-day entry ticket booked in advance to Legoland Windsor. But a package deal, booked through the Legoland site with two-day park entry on 5 and 6 August, plus overnight bed and breakfast at the Holiday Inn, Heathrow, eight miles from the park, would cost £20 less at £206.

Take food and drinks

Most theme parks have dedicated picnic areas. A notable exception is Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which says that picnics are not permitted beyond the main entrance ""due to limited space""– although exceptions are made for school parties, and there is a picnic area with tables and umbrellas just outside.

If you plan to buy meals on site, an ""all you can eat"" ticket bought in advance may save money.

An ""all-day dining"" ticket for our family of four at Alton Towers, allowing them to eat as much as they wanted at restaurants and kiosks, costs £79 if booked online in advance, though it excludes canned, bottled and alcoholic drinks (except for water) and certain food purchases.

Travel by train or coach

Several attractions charge for parking: £6 at Alton Towers and Blackpool Pleasure Beach; £4 at Legoland Windsor, or £7 for the closer priority car park; and £2 for pre-booked parking at Chessington.

An alternative is to travel by train or coach, getting a two-for-one entry deal into the bargain. National Rail's Days Out Guide website offers downloadable two-for-one entry vouchers for a wide range of attractions that can be used if you travel by train. To make use of an offer, print off your chosen vouchers and then present them together with your train tickets when you arrive. National Express runs a similar scheme when you use their coach services.

Beat the queues

The only free way to beat the queues is to arrive as soon as the park opens, and run straight to the most popular rides. Alternatively, you can save time, but certainly not money, by paying extra to skip the queues on major rides. At Alton Towers, for example, you can pre-book a variety of ""Fastrack"" tickets. Fastrack Scream, giving swift entry on three big rides – Nemesis, Nemesis Sub-Terra and Air – costs £12 per person.

At Legoland Windsor you can rent a ""Q-Bot"", a device that allows you to ""virtual queue"" for your rides. There are three types of Q-Bot: the Q-Bot Regular is £15 per person, while the Q-Bot Express, which cuts your waiting time by half, is £30, and the Q-Bot Ultimate, which gives ""near instant access"" to rides, is a hefty £70.",How to save money on theme parks,http://www.theguardian.com,[Jill Papworth],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Money/Pix/gallery/2014/6/11/1402485259472/Infusion-ride-at-Blackpoo-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=0c4720eedafb4df05d9a8a5aa0575a37,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/14/save-money-theme-parks-cut-cost
1013,"With TSB floating later this month, we look at the key issues for anyone interested in investing in the bank

Exactly how much shares in TSB will make when they go on sale later this month is still unclear, but its parent company, Lloyds Banking Group, has announced a price range of between 220p and 290p. So should you take the plunge and buy some? Here we answer questions about the share offer.

Why is Lloyds selling the shares?

During the financial crisis Lloyds Banking Group received a bail-out from the government and, under European Union rules on state aid, it was obliged to slim down its operation. This meant carving up its branch network. It originally planned to sell to the Co-op, but after that fell through, it set up the stand-alone TSB bank.

Lloyds now needs to sell that, and is doing so through a float. The initial public offering (IPO) will sell off 25%, but Lloyds has to offload the remaining 75% by the end of 2015.

How many shares can I buy?

You must spend at least £750, as with the Royal Mail IPO, but unlike that offer there is no upper limit on how many you can bid for. At the mid-price range of 255p you would get 294 for £750. If it is over-subscribed, which is unlikely, you might not get the amount requested.

Private investors who buy shares and hold on to them for a year will get one free share for every 20 they bought, up to a maximum of £2,000.

Where can I buy?

The bank cannot sell the shares itself – you have to apply through one of the stockbrokers or sharedealing services acting as ""intermediaries"", including well-known names such as Hargreaves Lansdown and The Share Centre.

You need to be quick because the offer is expected to close on Tuesday 17 June (it's possible some intermediaries may bring the shutters down before that). The price will be announced on Friday 20 June and dealing will start the same day.

A list of intermediaries is on the TSB website. Don't forget to find out about any fees they will charge.

Why should I buy?

Unlike other banks, TSB has no legacy issues with mis-selling or other scandals that could cost it money through fines from the regulator – Lloyds will keep all the liability for things such as PPI mis-selling.

The bank has 4.5 million customers already and has room to grow. Of its 631 branches, around 160 used to belong to Cheltenham & Gloucester and did not sell current accounts; now it expects to be able to increase its share of this market. It has also been out of the broker market for mortgages – which is estimated to account for around 40% of home loans sold – and plans to re-enter in 2015.

Why shouldn't I buy?

Setting up the separate bank has cost money, and winning new business could mean small margins, say analysts. Lloyds has another 75% of the business to sell off in the next 18 months, meaning that the supply of shares will be high and the price could fall.

The head of TSB, Paul Pester, has said investors need to be prepared to hold the shares as a long-term investment. TSB made profits of £172m last year but does not expect to be generating enough surplus to pay dividends until the end of the 2017 financial year.

Meanwhile, some might be concerned by the revelation that 45% of its mortgage customers have interest-only mortgages, and that it does not know how some intend to repay their loans.

John Blowers, at private investor website Trustnet Direct, said some of what was in the prospectus was ""encouraging"", but he added: ""Investors should be mindful that market valuations are currently very high, and if we see a wholesale sell-off, TSB shares will likely get caught up in the move lower, along with every other stock.

""What's more, the company is being sold on the prospects of relatively modest growth going forward. IPOs may offer investors some good reasons to buy equity, but this should always be part of a broader investment strategy.""",What you need to know about the TSB sell-off,http://www.theguardian.com,[Hilary Osborne],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/11/1402485026097/TSB-shares-will-go-on-sal-006.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d2576cf6b80ca4498a39751f9dd23497,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/14/tsb-float-key-issues
1015,"Generous interest rates mean that your everyday current account may be the best place to put your savings, say experts

Your everyday current account could be the best place to stash your cash, say experts, with interest rates often double those available on easy-access savings accounts.

Last week Tesco became the latest bank to enter the current account market, paying 3% on balances up to £3,000 and doling out extra Clubcard points for the supermarket's customers.

The bank joins the likes of Nationwide and TSB in offering market-leading interest rates on current account balances. Both of these pay 5% on balances, while Lloyds pays up to 4% and Santander and Bank of Scotland up to 3%. Compare this to the rates on their instant access savings accounts: Tesco pays 1.35%, Nationwide 0.5%, and TSB up to 1%.

""Current accounts are the new pseudo savings account,"" says Susan Hannums of independent savings advice site SavingsChampion.co.uk. ""Savers can't rely on a potential rate rise from the Bank of England to boost their savings. We fear that when this does happen banks and building societies are unlikely to apply it across the board on savings products.""

She adds, however, that savers should see the current account as part of a ""wider savings strategy"", rather than siphoning all their money into one.

There are of course downsides to saving in a current account. At Tesco, for example, you need to pay in a minimum £750 a month to qualify or be hit by a £5 monthly fee. And interest is paid on the first £3,000 only.

With Santander's 123 account, the interest is paid on a much higher £20,000 but you have to pay a fee of £2 a month.

Also, interest is subject to tax on a current account, whereas money in an Isa is tax-free.",Current accounts look good for savers,http://www.theguardian.com,[Lisa Bachelor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/28/1401298698003/A-branch-of-TSB-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=92d042a3c2be73813ce66e86f7b443c9,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/15/current-accounts-look-good-savers
1017,"Forces that caused the world economy to collapse, including income inequality and debt, are again in action, and could drag corporations down in their wake

The US Congressional Budget Office is projecting a continued economic recovery. So why look down the road – say, to 2017 – and worry?



Here's why: because the debt held by American households is rising ominously. And unless our economic policies change, that debt balloon, powered by radical income inequality, is going to become the next bust.

Our macro models at the Levy Economics Institute are showing that the US economy is about to face a repeat of pre-crisis-style, debt-led growth, based on increased borrowing. Falling government deficits are being replaced by rising debts on everyone else's ledgers – well, almost everyone else's.

What's emerging is a new sort of speculative bubble, this time based on consumer and corporate credit.

Right now, America is wrestling a three-headed monster of weak foreign demand, tight government budgets and high income inequality, with every sign that these conditions will continue. With that trio in place, the anticipated growth isn't going to be propelled by an export bonanza, or by a government investment boom.

It will have to be driven by spending. Even a limping recovery like the one we're nursing along today depends on domestic demand – consumer spending not just by the wealthy, but by everyone else.

We believe that Americans will keep consuming at the same ever-rising rates of past decades, during good times and bad. But for the vast majority, wages and wealth aren't going up, so we're anticipating that the majority of Americans – the 90% – will once again do what was done before: borrow, and then borrow more.

By early 2017, with growth likely to stall even according to CBO predictions, it should be apparent that we're reliving an alarming history. Middle- and low-income households have been following a trajectory of an ever-higher ratio of debt to income. That same ratio has been decreasing for the most well-off 10%, who are continuing to see debt decline and wealth rise.

Forces that prompted Occupy movements protesting income inequality and financial misconduct are again in action, according to research. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images

Why is the relationship between the debt of the 90% and the gains of the 10% so significant?

The evidence demonstrates that the de-leveraging of the very rich and the indebtedness of almost everyone else move in tandem; they follow the same trend line.



In short, there's a strong and continuous correlation between the rich getting richer, and the poor – make that the 90% – going deeper into debt.

That the share of income and wealth to the richest has skyrocketed is certainly not a new revelation. The heralded data tabulations of Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have demonstrated just how spectacular the plutocrats' portion became in the run-up to the Great Recession. They codified the belief that no one else can ever catch up with the very wealthiest.

One important explanation for that consolidation of wealth emerged from our latest research: The more – proportionally – that the top 10% has prospered, saved and invested (naturally, the gains found their way into the financial markets), the more the bottom 90% has borrowed.

Look at the record of how these phenomena have travelled in lockstep. In the first three decades after the second world war, the income of the 90% rose at the same pace as its consumption. But after the mid-1970s, a gap formed – the trend lines on earning and outlays spread apart. Spending continued apace. Real income, meanwhile, stagnated. It was lower in 2012 than it had been forty years earlier. That ever-increasing gap between income and consumption has been filled by borrowing.

These were the debt dynamics in the lead-up to the recession. But they are also the dynamics leading out of the crisis, and continuing today with no end in sight.

Before and after the crash, the fortunes of the most fortunate sped upward. Between 1983 and 2010, for example, the richest 20% increased in wealth by 100%. But their proportion of debt to wealth fell.

The bottom 40%, meanwhile, lost 270% in wealth.



It was much applauded when households began to rapidly pay down debt after 2007. And yet, despite this, their debt to equity ratio actually rose. With incomes plunging and the value of their assets – notably, housing – in a free-fall, they couldn't de-leverage fast enough. Debt outpaced everything else.

Insolvency for the 90% – the overwhelming majority of Americans – has become, in the decade's catch phrase, ""the new normal"". Unsustainable? Of course.

The debt picture is also changing dramatically for corporations. Historically, the private sector, which often goes by the moniker Corporate America, had not, overall, been borrowers. They increased their revenues far more than they borrowed money. Their net lending was exceptionally low, hovering at around 4% of GDP between 1960 and the mid 1990s.

Corporations are increasing their debt in the same way households did before the 2008 crisis, which left many families homeless and erecting tent cities, like this one in Sacramento. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

After the crisis, corporations, like households, pulled way back on borrowing. But, also like households, they are now increasing their debt. The steep rise began for non-financial corporations in 2010 (for families and individuals, debt levels began to go upwards again in 2013). We think these businesses will add another $4tn of debt between now and 2017.

Under the current disastrous economic and tax policies, we can look forward to rapid increases in debt for both corporations and households from at least 2015 to 2017: a tsunami of debt.



Alternatively, a teeth-gritting brake on household and corporate spending would be no help at all.

That's because if levels of debt and consumer consumption go down, the nation would move into what's called secular stagnation: anemic growth, if any, and higher unemployment. The CBO projections for growth can't possibly be met unless Americans take on massive liabilities, piling debt upon debt. Without debt accumulation, there wouldn't be enough demand – spending – to keep the economy moving.

To paraphrase Voltaire's words on God, even if bubbles and debt did not exist, it would be necessary to invent them. And that is exactly what we are doing.

1019,"Retailers adjust prices through the year as demand fluctuates, so save on a sports car in November or camera in May

Were you thinking of buying a sports car or a digital camera? Well, hold off until November on the former and, sorry, but you've just missed out on a bargain on the latter.

Throughout the year, retailers adjust their prices as demand for different items fluctuates, so you could save a packet by buying the aforementioned sports car in November and the camera in May. There are bargains to be had every month though, so, with a bit of planning, you could potentially save money all year round.

June

New televisions are generally released at the start of summer to coincide with the sporting season, so prices tend to drop on older models around that time. ""With the World Cup this year lots of people will be in the market for a new TV so there should be some good deals around if you do your research,"" says Andrew Walker, UK country manager at Pricerunner.com.

July

When the sun is shining, winter is likely the last thing on your mind – but if you are thinking of making your home more energy efficient, now is the time to do it. ""This market is very seasonal both for energy assessments and for the work itself,"" says Sarah McMonagle, spokeswoman at the Federation of Master Builders. ""Naturally people react to the need for energy efficiency work when it gets cold, so it may be possible to get a better price during the summer months.""

Heating engineers may also be less busy in the summer months and could be inclined to offer a cheaper quote.

If you are looking to buy a 4x4 vehicle, the (hopefully) warm weather this month means you are more likely to be successful when haggling for a better deal due to supply and demand. These hardier vehicles are easier for dealers to shift – and so are more expensive – in the wet and chilly months. Conversely, if you are in line for a convertible see November, below.

August

When it comes to buying bricks and mortar, the end of the summer often means lower prices. ""The autumn market is rarely as strong as the spring market, so the vendor has run out of time if the property has been on sale for several months,"" says Hugo Thistlethwayte, the managing director of buying agency Prime Purchase. ""As they will have to pay to re-market the property into a weaker autumn market, August can be a great time to get the vendor to move on the price.""

September

Back-to-school sales means looking for a discount on printers, mobile phones and laptops is easy during the first part of this month. What's more, shopping at the end of the summer could save you as much as a third on a desktop computer, according to figures from Pricerunner.

October

If you are after a new lawnmower, grill or garden furniture, October is a great time to look for a deal. According to consumer group Which?, retailers have to make room for all their winter gear this month, so summer staples get their prices slashed.

November

If you are shopping for a sports car, this is great time to grab a bargain due to the cold weather. As convertibles are most expensive during the summer months, by shopping in the winter you will save a bundle. This is down to supply and demand – in the summer, car dealers give smaller discounts on brand new convertibles due to increased customer interest, while second-hand sellers do not need to drop price to make a sale at this time.

December

The run up to Christmas is the best time to secure a good deal on a new car, as this period is between new plate releases and the dealerships will be quiet. Further add to your savings and make your purchase in the final days of the month, as the dealership will do everything they can to complete a sale, says Kieren Puffett, editor at Parkers.

Tradesmen such as painters and decorators tend to be cheaper to hire in the winter months, as they are unable to carry out external decoration so are relying solely on internal works to keep their business going. ""Some construction firms admit to offering slightly more competitive prices in the winter months as depending on the trade, there may be less work around and more builders fighting for it,"" says McMonagle.

January

The January sales are known for bargain prices, but this is especially true when it comes to gadgets according to Which?. Now is the time to snap up deals on new televisions, satnavs, cameras, printers and DVD players.

This month is also a great opportunity to get your hands on second-hand gadgets as people sell off unwanted Christmas gifts or old models that have been replaced.

February

If you're looking to upgrade your household appliances, February is best for a bargain as that is when new models are rolled out. Snap up cheap end–of-the-line products such as washing machines, fridge freezers and dishwashers this month, says Which?.

Also, if you are planning on sending flowers to someone special on Valentine's Day, the earlier you place your order, the less you will pay – it could save you as much as 20% as the later you order them, the more you will have to pay to make sure they get there on time.

March

March is an ideal month to look for a bargain on a used car, says Puffett. ""Shop for a used car right after the new registrations come out as dealers would have taken in a lot of part exchanges against new cars,"" he says. The increase in supply means that buyers this month will be in a better position to haggle the price down.

April

If you like hunting for a bargain in charity shops, get your hands on some great stuff this month as many households do their spring cleaning in April - which means these not-for-profit retailers will be getting a lot of new inventory.

Around Easter is a good time to look for DIY deals, as retailers are keen to get your custom and offer attractive discounts.

May

This month is a great time to save on a digital camera, says Walker. ""Manufacturers tend to update their ranges at the end of spring so it is a good time to get a deal on older camera models as retailers try to clear out stock,"" he says. This year, for instance, the average cost of a digital camera dropped by a third between January and May.

Walker says this happens again in autumn when new models come out in time for Christmas, so you can snap up some bargains then too.",It's never too late to pick up a bargain – if you know when to buy,http://www.theguardian.com,[Kara Gammell],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402924376219/Bargain-buyers-guide-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=afbf4390d399911aa0ab52eea52e1857,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/16/bargain-buyers-guide-camera-car
1021,"The British public dramatically underestimate what the poorest pay in tax and wrongly believe the richest face the biggest tax burden, according to new research that calls for a more progressive system.

The poorest 10% of households pay eight percentage points more of their income in all taxes than the richest – 43% compared to 35%, according to a report from the Equality Trust.

The thinktank highlights what it sees as a gulf between perceptions of the tax system and reality. Its poll, conducted with Ipsos Mori found that nearly seven in ten people believe that households in the highest 10% income group pay more of their income in tax than those in the lowest 10%.

The survey of more than 1,000 people also found a strong majority – 96% – believe that the tax system should be more progressive than is currently the case.

Duncan Exley, director of the Equality Trust, said the findings underlined the need for the next government to overhaul the system.

""The public are misled about this country's tax system. They think households with the highest incomes pay more than those with the lowest, whereas the opposite is the case. Even more concerning is how little our current system matches people's preferences on tax. There is clearly strong support for a system that places far less burden on low-income households,"" he said ahead of the ""Unfair and Unclear"" report.

""We're calling on all parties seeking to form the government from 2015 to commit to the principle that any changes in tax policy are progressive.""

Not a single respondent in the poll knew how much the richest and poorest paid in tax. On average the public underestimates what the poorest 10% pays in tax by 19 percentage points, believing they pay just 24% of their income in taxes, the Equality Trust said.

When asked about how to make the tax system fairer, on average, people said the poorest 10% should be taxed just 15% of their income, or 28% percentage points less than they currently are. They believe the richest 10% should be taxed 39%, or 4 percentage points more than now.

The report said the higher percentage paid by the poor at the moment was down to a number of taxes. ""While income tax and national insurance are broadly progressive, the bottom 10% of households pay roughly 23% of their gross household income in indirect taxes on consumption and more than four times as much of their income in council tax as the top 10%,"" it said.

It urged the next government to radically reform council tax by re-evaluating properties and creating new bands with higher rates for high value properties. It also called for ministers to cut VAT when it has a budget surplus.

The recommendations follow calls from the European Commission earlier this month for the UK government to reform the ""regressive"" council tax system, as taxes are relatively higher on low-value homes than high-value ones.","British public wrongly believe rich pay most in tax, new research shows",http://www.theguardian.com,[Katie Allen],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402838607095/Money-taxes-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=68659ba500d27f1aebb22e990dcb635a,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/16/british-public-wrong-rich-poor-tax-research
1023,"Crowdfunding websites bringing investors together with projects seeking a cash injection are booming. But what are the risks?

Would you help pay for a book to be published that features tales from mums caring for children with life-limiting conditions? This is one of thousands of crowdfunding projects seeking funds. Lives Worth Living is asking for £7,500 on website Crowdfunder to cover costs. In return, you receive a copy of the book or even a page dedication, depending on the amount.

The phenomenon of crowdfunding is booming. You can stake from just £10 to emulate the likes of Duncan Bannatyne by becoming a ""mini-dragon"", backing an ever-expanding range of ventures from theatre productions to electronic gizmos. A musical production of The Wind in the Willows is among thousands of projects taking part in the trend, raising £1m earlier this year.

But as this craze gains momentum, what are the risks? A wide range of websites have sprung up bringing investors together with projects seeking a cash injection.

The Crowdfunding Centre said more than £3,500 per hour is being raised in the UK. Since the beginning of 2014, more than 6,561 projects have been launched.

In return for your investment you may be offered a tangible ""reward"", such as tickets to a gig or a T-shirt, an equity stake in the business – or even a share in a buy-to-let.

Typically, crowdfunding websites benefit by taking a percentage commission of money raised, at an average of 5%, alongside – sometimes – a slice of returns paid to investors. So check the fine print.

The House Crowd says its participants can put from £1,000 down on a buy-to-let property to receive a guaranteed 6% net return per year plus a share of profits on sale. Alternatively, they can opt for a fixed return of 7.5% net a year with no equity in the property. A typical property currently listed is a two-bedroom terrace house in Moston, Manchester, valued at £68,000 after refurbishment.

Experts warn that investors should check crowdfunding site credentials carefully. Property expert Henry Pryor says: ""There are many new opportunities and the vast majority will be bonefide operations but potential investors should check just who or what they are before they hand over their money.

""I fear that we are going to find a significant number of hooky sites that will promise you the world, take your money and leave you feeling very stupid.""

The majority of the sites offer warnings stating that investors risk losing their cash if new ventures fail, typically via an online questionnaire. However, some check enterprises more extensively than others.

Since April, the sector has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. It says this should stop crowdfunding websites running off with your cash, but it won't prevent a small business you've backed from failing. Christopher Woolard, director of policy, risk and research at the FCA, says: ""We want to ensure that consumers are appropriately protected – but not prevented from investing. The rules provide consumer protection while allowing businesses to continue to have access to this innovative method of funding.""

Here we look at some of the projects on offer.

Music, art and films

Kickstarter, which originated in the US, offers a massive range of reward-based projects. It opened its doors to British investors in October 2012.

The Observer found a staggering 3,381 projects seeking funding, ranging from mobile phone apps and circus performances, to an ""eco"" magazine for kids. It lists the percentage of the total amount sought that has been pledged so far, and how many days there are left to invest.

A project has to reach its goal before the deadline, or no money changes hands, and less than 50% make it. The minimum pledge is usually £1 or $1. However, beware that the site ""does not investigate a creator's ability to complete their project"".

Among those projects listed as successfully funded is a truck offering ""Good & Proper"" tea to Londoners. This asked for £10 or more in return for a bag of tea, to free hire of the van for a party or wedding if you could stretch to £1,000. It sought a total of £10,000, and successfully raised £14,682.

Energy

Among the sites that target green–energy are Trillion Fund and Abundance. Trillion Fund launched a new crowdfunding platform last week that enables people to lend directly to renewable energy projects from £50, in return for an income. Typical returns on the site range from 3%-9%, with terms ranging from three to 20 years. Rebecca O'Connor of Trillion Fund says: ""Loan-based renewable energy crowdfunds have more in common with bonds than with equity crowdfunds, because they can come with fixed interest rates over a few years.""

""Buying an equity stake in an early stage start-up is considered more risky than lending against an operational wind project, for example, because, with the latter, there is historical performance and revenue data. The amount of energy – and therefore revenue – that solar panels and wind turbines generate is relatively predictable, which means funders have a sensible idea of what their returns will be.""

Abundance has crowdfunded £6m of projects so far, with a mix of wind and solar energy in the UK. You can invest as little as £5. You buy debentures, similar to IOUs and, in return, you are paid a share of the profits from generating green energy. The site has three projects open for investment offering a range of fixed and variable returns over 20 years of between 6.75% and 9%.

For example, Engynious Schools is seeking £1m to share ownership and returns with private investors from solar panels it owns on 19 schools across the UK. On average, an investor places about £5,800 across three or more projects, according to founder Bruce Davis.

Small businesses/start-ups

There is a large range of sites.InvestingZone was launched in May 2013, and offers a stake in some early-stage companies. It says it only allows people to invest if they understand the risks.

SyndicateRoom, another newer entrant, offers users the chance to ""top up"" large stakes in a business that have been bought by established investors.

Seedrs and Crowdcube are among the well-established, both offering a minimum investment of £10. Seedrs rasies an average of £1m each month for start-ups that are struggling to get off the ground, and says it is up to the investor whether they are happy to take the risk on a business they hope will succeed.

Some high-profile figures are joining the crowdfunding throng. Fund manager Nicola Horlick attracted £150,000 in just one day last year through Seedrs towards fund management firm Glentham Capital. This success prompted her to launch Money&Co, a crowdfunding website with risk ratings for each business seeking funding.

Among other sites, Peoplefund.itand Crowdfunder feature creative enterprises seeking backing in return for rewards. On Indiegogo, you can put money towards political campaigns, humanitarian projects and technology start-ups. Buzzbnk and CrowdBnk also include a variety of projects, from charities to many other businesses.

Some sites are more niche. For example, unbound is a crowdfunding website and a publisher, while MoolaHoop exclusively lists business ventures from female entrepreneurs.",Crowdfunding proving the perfect match-maker,http://www.theguardian.com,[Harriet Meyer],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402592128221/Mr-Toad-from-The-Wind-in--006.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=fa326e1f1a960c06dc770e20ca0ea421,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/16/crowdfunding-invest-cash-risks
1025,"Ofgem vows to make process easier, raising hopes of increased competition and an end to the dominance of the 'big six' firms

Householders will be able to switch energy suppliers within three days by the end of this year under major new rules for the industry to be unveiled on Monday by the regulator, Ofgem.

The watchdog said it will also make the switching process much more easy and reliable, while revealing it is already working on a 24-hour switching system to be ready by 2018.

Enabling customers to easily move from one supplier to another is seen as a vital way of breaking the dominance of the big six power companies such as SSE and British Gas, while helping new entrants such as Ovo or Good Energy to grow.

""Consumers can change their bank in seven days, their mobile phone in just a couple, but have to wait significantly longer to switch their energy supplier,"" said Dermot Nolan, Ofgem's chief executive.

""We know that consumers want a reliable and efficient switching process, and that concerns about it going wrong can put them off shopping around for a better deal. So following the steps we have taken steps to make the market simpler, clearer, fairer, we are now leading a programme which will deliver faster, more reliable switching,"" he added.

The move, which comes amid continuing anger about soaring bills and frustration about poor service, was welcomed by consumer groups and the small but growing independent supply sector.

""Faster, easier switching would be welcome news for consumers trying to find a better energy deal,"" said Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd. ""Suppliers should introduce 24-hour switching as quickly as possible, under close scrutiny from Ofgem so that the cost to consumers of the new system does not spiral. It will also be essential that suppliers do more to introduce simple pricing so consumers can easily see the best deal for them before they switch,"" he added.

Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, described the announcement as a ""game-changer"" that she believed was needed to encourage consumers to engage more deeply with the energy market.

""With half of households yet to switch their energy supplier, it is clear there are barriers that need to be broken down. For many of these, it will be a question of confidence and fear of the unknown. However, measures such as those outlined today should improve this and provide people with greater reassurance.""

Good Energy, an independent power supplier, also welcomed the move. It said: ""It should be easy for customers to engage with energy suppliers, and this is another step in the right direction.""",Energy supplier shakeup will allow customers to switch in three days,http://www.theguardian.com,[Terry Macalister],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/29/1383057063076/fc69225b-188a-4f3a-b7d4-df41ffd3cafc-460x276.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=f243f925cbd05a52f2e5867048ab4c77,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/16/energy-supplier-shakeup-customers-switch-big-six

Despite that, we have been sent a gas bill by British Gas for more than £26,000. We phoned British Gas and it arranged for a reading the following week. We were then told the bill had gone up to £28,000. British Gas asked a series of questions – one of which was: ""Do you have a tropical fish tank?""

We were worried about a possible leak and a local heating engineer said to turn the gas off and ring the emergency gas line. Northern Gas Networks eventually came out and tested the meter. Even when the supply was switched off, the meter still registered gas flow.

A British Gas engineer told us he would sort it out, but we have heard nothing since. The meter continues to register a large gas flow. We'd like to know just how long it has been faulty – and how much have we been overcharged over the years. RG, Otley, West Yorkshire

This is an interesting case, with ramifications for many other gas customers who have the same meter (above). The sheer size of the bill brought the problem to your attention. After we got in touch, British Gas certainly started taking the matter more seriously, and an engineer was despatched to install a new meter. During this process, you were told by the engineer there had been many problems with these meters which, typically, were installed in the 1990s.

Happily, the company has now wiped the £28,000 bill from your account, and has agreed to monitor your usage and backdate any refunds.

You are understandably concerned that you have been overpaying for the past five years, and this will not be simple to resolve. It seems your previous meter readings going back two years were ignored as they were deemed ""too high"". As a result, estimates were used.

You will need to go back through what you have paid and compare it with what you should have paid once you have established your true consumption – no mean task.

Meanwhile, if anyone else has one of these meters – a Eurometers/Siemens E6 meter – in their home, you may want to check your bills very closely. Around 1.6m were fitted in homes, according to the National Grid.

In January last year, Ray Cope, a gas meter expert, told MPs on the Commons energy and climate change committee that the record of the gas industry on meter accuracy over the past 30 years had been ""abysmal"". He described how the Eurometers – and, to a much lesser degree, the Siemens model – soon developed serious faults in service. The fault was known as ""incrementing"", which he said was ""a polite way of saying they could record gas that was not being used"".

It seems the gas industry is aware of problems with these meters, but this is the first time we have come across the issue.

1031,"The advert that led to complaints against the Yorkshire Building Society.

The UK's second largest building society, the Yorkshire, has been fined £1.4m after it lured 56,000 of its savers into taking out a stock market-related bond that promised a gain of up to 72% over six years, when it knew the chance of customers obtaining the advertised return was close to zero.

Credit Suisse International, which operated the ""Cliquet"" bond on behalf of Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) and a few smaller distributors, was also fined £2.4m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

The bond was designed as a safe ""stepping stone"" product, usually sold on a limited offer basis, with the promise of 100% capital security. Customers would obtain a guaranteed minimum return over the period, typically about 15% over six years, with the adverts giving near equal prominence to the chance of obtaining returns of as much as 72%. But in a damning verdict, the FCA said: ""Throughout the relevant period, YBS was aware that the likelihood of achieving the maximum return was close to 0%.""

In reality, of the Cliquet products sold across all distributors, six out of 10 customers obtained only the minimum return, while the average additional return that savers obtained was just 0.45% a year. Not a single saver obtained the advertised 72% return. YBS and Credit Suisse had ""backtested"" the product, and knew before marketing the bond to savers that it offered little hope of achieving the maximum return. In a document marked for 'professionals' only, an evaluation pack said: ""The model driven-probabilities suggest approximatey a 50% chance of receiving only the minimum return … and then a limited or decreasing possibility at higher levels.""

Consumer campaigners at Which? first highlighted the misleading advertising by YBS four years ago. In September 2010 it wrote to YBS expressing concerns about the product and its marketing, and later issues of the Cliquet bond were amended so that less prominence was given to the maximum return.

Customers will have the chance to exit the bonds ""and receive an appropriate rate of interest"". In a statement, the society said: ""YBS fully accepts the decision made by the FCA and we apologise to our customers. On this occasion we have fallen short of our own high standards, and of putting our customers at the heart of everything we do.""

Credit Suisse added: ""We have taken this matter very seriously, have fully cooperated with the FCA's investigation and have agreed a comprehensive redress process under which affected retail customers will be eligible to claim compensation.""

After the concerns about the bond emerged, YBS wrote to 2,800 customers who had bought the latest tranche of the bond, telling them of the very low chances of obtaining the maximum return. Nearly one in five decided to ask for their money back.

The fine and possible compensation payouts has echoes of the widespread mis-selling of complex investment products by Norwich and Peterborough building society, which cost the society £51m and was the principal reason why it sought a takeover – by the Yorkshire building society.

1033,"Q I am a pensioner aged 70, and including pension credit, my pension is £100 a week. I have a £750 overdraft which is just about maxed out. However, I own my own house, and there is no mortgage to pay. I have been thinking of equity release and keep receiving brochures about it.

I don't really understand the ramifications of equity release. I don't have children or anyone close to leave the property to – although I do have four godchildren who will get something when I die. I would love to travel and be able to do enjoyable things. AS

A Equity release is a way of cashing in some of the value of your home while still having the right to live there. There are two main types of equity release schemes: the lifetime mortgage and the home reversion scheme.

With an equity release lifetime mortgage, you raise cash by taking out a mortgage on your home which lasts until you die and/or your home is sold. Interest is charged on the mortgage but you don't pay it during your lifetime. Unlike a normal mortgage, rather than paying the interest after taking out the loan, the interest charged is rolled up and added to the money borrowed and repaid when the property is sold on your death. The major downside of this is that the interest bill can add a significant amount to the size of the original amount borrowed, not least because interest is charged on the loan plus rolled up interest. The consumer group Which? found that after 10 years of taking out a lifetime mortgage of £40,000 with an average fixed-interest rate of 6.9%, the amount owed would have more than doubled to just over £80,000. So the ramifications for the beneficiaries of your will are that a significant part of the proceeds from selling your home after your death will go towards paying off the equity release mortgage plus accumulated interest.

You can reduce the amount of money that'll be needed to pay off the mortgage on your death by going for a drawdown loan where, instead of taking a large lump sum at the start of the loan, you borrow smaller amounts either as you need the cash or on a regular basis. Because you are taking smaller amounts over time, the debt will grow more slowly and the interest charged will be less. Taking only small sums could also mean that you would be less likely to lose your pension credit and any other means-tested benefits which could very well happen if you raised a large lump sum.

With a home reversion scheme, instead of borrowing against your home, you sell a proportion of it to a reversion company which, when you die and the property is sold, gets that proportion of the sale proceeds. So if, for example, you sold 50% of your home, the reversion company would get 50% of the money from the sale. The big downside with a home reversion scheme is that, although no interest is charged on them, it is expensive because the price the reversion company pays for its share is a lot less than its market value. For example, you could sell a 50% share of your home but receive the equivalent of just 15% of the value of your home in cash. If you were to go down the home reversion route, you would know how much of the proceeds of selling your home after your death would go to your heirs. That is, if you sold a 50% share, you would leave them the 50% of the house that you didn't sell.

The much cheaper alternative to both types of equity release scheme would be to raise cash by moving to a cheaper home. If this isn't an option and you think you would like to investigate equity release further, make sure you get advice from an adviser who holds an equity release qualification. More information is available from the Money Advice Service.

1041,"Election data can help give insights into voting behaviour, but the lack of open data is hampering the analysis researchers can do argue the Open Data Institute and Deloitte

Even after the local council elections in England and Northern Ireland on 22 May, which coincided with polling for the European Parliament, the next 12 months remain a busy time for the democratic process in the UK.

In September, the people of Scotland make their choice in a referendum on the future of the Union. Finally, the first fixed-term parliament in Westminster comes to an end with a general election in all areas of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in May 2015.



To ensure that as many people as possible are eligible and able to vote, the government is launching an ambitious programme of Individual Electoral Registration (IER) this summer. This will mean that the traditional, paper-based approach to household registration will shift to a tailored and largely digital process more in-keeping with the data-driven demands of the twenty-first century.

Under IER, citizens will need to provide ‘identifying information’, such as date of birth or national insurance number, when applying to register.

Ballots: stuck in the past?

However, despite the government’s attempts through IER to improve the veracity of information captured prior to ballots being posted, little has changed in terms of the vision for capturing, distributing and analysing digital data from election day itself.

Indeed, paper is still the chosen medium for data collection.

Digitising elections is fraught with difficulty, though. In the US, for example, the introduction of new voting machines created much controversy even though they are capable of providing ‘near-perfect’ ballot data.

The UK’s democratic process is not completely blind, though. Numerous opinion surveys are conducted both before and after polling, including the long-running British Election Study, to understand the shifting attitudes of a representative cross-section of the electorate.

But if the government does not retain in sufficient geographic detail digital information on the number of people who vote, then how can it learn what is necessary to reverse the long-running decline in turnout?

The effects of lack of data

To add to the debate around democratic engagement, a joint research team, with data scientists from Deloitte and the Open Data Institute (ODI), have been attempting to understand what makes voters tick.

Our research has been hampered by a significant lack of relevant data describing voter behaviour at electoral ward level, as well as difficulties in matching what little data is available to other open data sources, such as demographic data from the 2011 Census.

Even though individual ballot papers are collected and verified for counting the number of votes per candidate – the primary aim of elections, after all – the only recent elections for which aggregate turnout statistics have been published at ward level are the 2012 local council elections in England and Wales. In these elections, approximately 3,000 wards from a total of over 8,000 voted.

Data published by the Electoral Commission for the 2013 local council elections in England and Wales purports to be at ward level but is, in fact, for ‘county electoral divisions’, as explained by the Office for National Statistics.

Moreover, important factors related to the accessibility of polling stations – such as the distance from main population centres – could not be assessed because the location of polling stations remains the responsibility of individual local authorities – and only eight of these have so far published their data as open data.

Given these fundamental limitations, drawing any robust conclusions is difficult. Nevertheless, our research shows the potential for forecasting electoral turnout with relatively few census variables, the most significant of which are age and the size of the electorate in each ward.

Median age by ward. Map: ODI/Deloitte

Turnout percentage by ward. Map: /ODI/Deloitte

Wards with a high proportion of older people in the electorate tended to experience higher turnout in the 2012 elections. Younger electorates, on the other hand, experienced lower turnout. The challenge for policy makers here is that although young people remain interested in politics, they are disengaged and disillusioned with the electoral process – preferring instead to express their individual opinions via social media.

In addition, the highest turnouts in the local council elections of 2012 were achieved in wards with a small electorate. One of the reasons for this may be that a community ‘network effect’ is more effective in rural wards. From a statistical perspective, there is a greater likelihood that small wards may experience results that deviate significantly from average turnout, which has very little to do with causal factors.

What role can open data play?

The limited results described above provide a tantalising glimpse into a possible future scenario: where open data provides a deeper and more granular understanding of electoral behaviour.

On the back of more sophisticated analyses, policies for improving democratic engagement – particularly among young people – have the potential to become focused and evidence-driven.

And, although the data captured on election day will always remain primarily for the use of electing the public’s preferred candidate, an important secondary consideration is aggregating and publishing data that can be used more widely.

This may have been prohibitively expensive or too complex in the past but as storage and processing costs continue to fall, and the appetite for such knowledge grows, there is a compelling business case.

The benefits of this future scenario potentially include:

tailoring awareness and marketing campaigns to wards and other segments of the electorate most likely to respond positively and subsequently turn out to vote



increasing the efficiency with which European, general and local elections are held in the UK



improving transparency around the electoral process and stimulating increased democratic engagement



enhancing links to the Government’s other significant data collection activities, including the Census.



Achieving these benefits requires commitment to electoral data being collected and published in a systematic fashion at least at ward level. This would link work currently undertaken by the Electoral Commission, the ONS, Plymouth University’s Election Centre, the British Election Study and the more than 400 local authorities across the UK.

1047,"Andy Green, RAF fighter pilot, record breaker and action hero, slipped off his shoes before clambering into the cockpit of Bloodhound, the supersonic car being handcrafted in the UK to hit the 1,000mph mark. ""I don't want to put my boot through any of the digital displays. That wouldn't be too clever.""

By next summer Bloodhound SSC will be racing along a Cornish test track and few weeks later be transported to a desert in South Africa where the plan is for it to reach 800mph and break Green's own current land-speed record of 763mph. Then in 2015, if all goes well, Green will return to South Africa and drive Bloodhound at 1,000mph, faster than a bullet, faster than an aircraft.

At the unveiling of the cockpit – a key stage in the development of the 10-year project – Green said the idea was not just to make history but to push back the laws of physics and inspire a new generation across the world to become scientists and engineers. ""This is the greatest engineering adventure in motor sport,"" he said.

Mission control for the Bloodhound challenge is an ordinary-looking unit on an industrial estate in Avonmouth near Bristol. On one side of Bloodhound HQ is a joinery, on the other a plumber's merchants. In front is a greasy spoon burger van. But inside it looks like something out of a James Bond film.

It is hard to grasp just how fast 1,000mph is. Green said the best way of illustrating it was to imagine it travelling the length of a football pitch. If a spectator blinked, he or she would not see the car driving past. ""That is fast.""

The cockpit turns out to be a pleasing combination of the super-high tech and the ordinary. It features, for example, state-of-the art ballistic armour to protect the driver from a shooting stone or bird strike. But the triggers on the steering wheel that control the car's rockets were taken from an ordinary hand power drill – because they are built to withstand huge vibration and dust. ""They told me to go down to B&Q and pick the one I liked best,"" said Green.

Should the digital displays suffer a catastrophic failure, the team has got Rolex to create a comforting-looking analogue stopwatch and speedometer.

There are also chunky back-up levers to activate the parachutes that help stop the car and to cut off the fuel supply to the jet engine.

But, to be fair, most of it is super high-tech. The cockpit is made of five different types of carbon fibre weave and two different resins. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core to provide additional strength. At its thickest point the cockpit comprises of 13 individual layers but is just 25mm in cross section.

The roof of the cockpit – and the front of the car – have been designed to create a series of shockwaves that will slow the air down and channel it into the Eurojet engine (airflow of 1,000mph would damage the engine). That process – combined with the noise of the jet plus a racing car engine and a cluster of rockets – makes the cockpit a noisy place to be, at least until it outruns its own sound waves.

Inside the central control screen shows the speed in miles per hour and Mach number. The panel has also been designed to allow Green to keep a careful eye on the wheel loads – the key safety requirement is to keep the car's wheels firmly on the ground. If they lift, Green will have a big problem. ""I'll have one eye on that at all times,"" he said.

Naturally, huge care has been invested in the titanium steering wheel, shaped to Green's hands and finger reach. Buttons on the front control the radio (for communicating with his team rather than listening to music), air brakes and parachutes, while those power drill triggers on the rear of the handgrips prime and fire the rockets. Bloodhound has pedals like a normal car – right for the accelerator, left for the brakes, though these wheel brakes only contribute to about 1% of the braking power.

For the moment the cockpit has a comfy foam seat. By next year this will be replaced by a carbon fibre one moulded to Green's body shape to mitigate the effects of the huge G-forces that will be exerted on him.

Green said it would be noisy, hot (there is no air conditioning). And though he is the current land-speed record holder, having set the record in Thrust SSC in 1997, he accepts he does not know what it will be like travelling at 1,000mph along a desert trace track. ""This is human adventure, it's about people doing stuff, it's climbing Everest, it's Neil Armstrong stepping on to the moon. We don't know what it will be like in this cockpit. That's part of the adventure.""","Bloodhound SSC: cockpit of 1,000mph car unveiled",http://www.theguardian.com,[Steven Morris],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402667204540/SSC-Bloodhound-jet-car-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=52d5f056695704ad731ec6ff70a09398,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/13/bloodhound-ssc-cockpit-1000mph-car-unveiled
1049,"Tests show crustaceans experience basic emotions and calm down when given drugs used to treat anxiety in humans

Crayfish feel emotional stress and calm down when given a drug used to treat anxiety in humans, research has shown.

The findings suggest that even invertebrates experience rudimentary emotions – something not suspected before.

In the experiment, scientists exploited the fact that the crustaceans are more comfortable in darker water. After giving crayfish a series of mild electric shocks, they placed the creatures in an aquarium ""maze"" containing both well-lit and darkened paths.

Although non-stressed crayfish preferred the dark paths, they also explored the lit regions. But crayfish given the electric shocks hardly entered the lit paths of the aquarium at all.

The stressed animals' light avoidance was linked to raised levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which also has an effect on mood in humans.

Merely injecting crayfish with the neurotransmitter was enough to make them anxious, the researchers said.

They also found that the creatures responded positively to chlordiazepoxide (CDZ), a drug used to treat anxiety in humans. Treated crustaceans lost their nerves and were happier to explore the bright parts of the aquarium.

The team, led by Dr Daniel Cattaert from the University of Bordeaux, wrote in the journal Science: ""Analyses of this ancestral behaviour in a simple model reveal a new route to understanding anxiety and may alter our conceptions of the emotional status of invertebrates. Our results … emphasise the ability of an invertebrate to exhibit a state that is similar to a mammalian emotion.""","Crayfish feel stress, claim scientists",http://www.theguardian.com,[Press Association],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402646151696/Crayfish-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=499d9bbf9641469454ff54b02aa86a81,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/13/crayfish-feel-stress-claim-scientists
1051,"Scientists say rock layer hundreds of miles down holds vast amount of water, opening up new theories on how planet formed

After decades of searching scientists have discovered that a vast reservoir of water, enough to fill the Earth’s oceans three times over, may be trapped hundreds of miles beneath the surface, potentially transforming our understanding of how the planet was formed.



The water is locked up in a mineral called ringwoodite about 660km (400 miles) beneath the crust of the Earth, researchers say. Geophysicist Steve Jacobsen from Northwestern University in the US co-authored the study published in the journal Science and said the discovery suggested Earth’s water may have come from within, driven to the surface by geological activity, rather than being deposited by icy comets hitting the forming planet as held by the prevailing theories.



“Geological processes on the Earth’s surface, such as earthquakes or erupting volcanoes, are an expression of what is going on inside the Earth, out of our sight,” Jacobsen said.



“I think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole-Earth water cycle, which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet. Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades.”

Jacobsen and his colleagues are the first to provide direct evidence that there may be water in an area of the Earth’s mantle known as the transition zone. They based their findings on a study of a vast underground region extending across most of the interior of the US.

Ringwoodite acts like a sponge due to a crystal structure that makes it attract hydrogen and trap water.

If just 1% of the weight of mantle rock located in the transition zone was water it would be equivalent to nearly three times the amount of water in our oceans, Jacobsen said.



The study used data from the USArray, a network of seismometers across the US that measure the vibrations of earthquakes, combined with Jacobsen’s lab experiments on rocks simulating the high pressures found more than 600km underground.

It produced evidence that melting and movement of rock in the transition zone – hundreds of kilometres down, between the upper and lower mantles – led to a process where water could become fused and trapped in the rock.

The discovery is remarkable because most melting in the mantle was previously thought to occur at a much shallower distance, about 80km below the Earth’s surface.

Jacobsen told the New Scientist that the hidden water might also act as a buffer for the oceans on the surface, explaining why they have stayed the same size for millions of years. ""If [the stored water] wasn't there, it would be on the surface of the Earth, and mountaintops would be the only land poking out,"" he said.",Earth may have underground 'ocean' three times that on surface,http://www.theguardian.com,[Melissa Davey],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402631525436/d8602be7-2ca2-41a4-947d-83e81bc1ab93-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=6b65a45a97374b960cb9ab6e39fd759b,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/13/earth-may-have-underground-ocean-three-times-that-on-surface
1053,"Many would assume that the kinds of living mammals are completely known or nearly so, but they would be wrong. Not only has the number of known mammals steadily increased in recent decades, there is no evidence that the ""species accumulation"" curve is approaching an asymptote. While a few groups such as rodents and bats account for a significant proportion of the numbers, the consistency with which large and showy mammals are found is astounding. Last year, for example, saw the description of the carnivorous olinguito as well as a new species of tapir from South America.

The supply of Chiroptera similarly shows no sign of depletion, evidenced by a recent 14-year span, ending in 2007, during which no less than 78 new bat species were formally described. Our understanding of species diversity depends not only on field work, but also on the critical testing of what we think we already know. Given new data or additional specimens, it is not uncommon to revise our theory of what a species is, either increasing or decreasing the amount of genetic variation accepted within the limits of an already recognised species.

For decades, the bat Miniopterus schreibersii, named by Kuhl in 1817, has been undefeated in holding the title for the most widely distributed mammal on Earth. Recent taxonomic revisionary work, however, suggests that what had been considered one species is instead a large complex of similar-appearing species and questioning just how wide its range is. As the species in this complex are teased apart and unambiguously diagnosed, the issue of which one continues to go by the name M schreibersii arises. This is where type specimens come in. The type of the species intended by Kuhl was from a cave on the left bank of the Danube near Coronini, Romania. His original specimen, designated as holotype, serves as the name-bearer. Once mammalogists settle on what and how many species exist, using all available specimens and data, whichever one the type specimen fits within receives the name. For now, it is possible to begin to atomise the complex, recognising, describing and naming species that are clearly different from the specimens seen in Romania.

A team of scientists led by Sébastien J Puechmaille of University College Dublin has differentiated one such species from northern Africa, Miniopterus maghrebensis. The new species differs from M schreibersii in a whole suite of attributes arising from their study that included cranial morphology, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and acoustic signature. The geographic range of the new species extends from northern Morocco to south of the High Atlas mountains and northern Tunisia. Interestingly, the new species and M schreibersii do occur together in coastal regions of North Africa. The name given to the new bat refers to the Maghreb region where it lives, that is, lands of northern Africa between the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Sahara.

So far, the conservative morphology in the genus makes it very difficult to confidently distinguish between the two species in the field. Positive IDs of the new species, for the present, depend on examination of molecular or cranial data, but more detailed comparative morphology, ecology and nesting behaviour, particularly in areas of sympatry, may yield reliable field characters.",New to Nature No 125: Miniopterus maghrebensis,http://www.theguardian.com,[Quentin Wheeler],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/11/1402501936311/miniopteris-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=b471318b1f03341bd7b92697345e7761,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/15/new-to-nature-miniopterus-maghrebensis-bat-north-africa
1055,"A star has been found that may be a sister of our Sun, born in the same cloud of gas and dust in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The Sun, the Earth and the other planets coalesced some 4.54 billion years ago within a such a cloud, probably with thousands of other stars. This age comes from radiometric measures of radioactive isotopes and their decay products in meteorites, the oldest rocks we can handle, while there is plenty of observational evidence for ongoing star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.

Only last week, news emerged of more than 300 previously-unrecognised clusters of young stars, still largely obscured by dust. In time, and usually within a few hundred million years, such stars emerge from their dusty cocoons and drift apart to follow their own orbits about the centre of the galaxy. Being built from the same raw material gives each of the stars precisely the same chemical makeup, while their orbits too can point to a shared origin.

These clues have been used by a team of astronomers led by the University of Texas to identify the Sun's potential sibling. Still unnamed but known as HD 162826 or by a number of other catalogue designations, it is plainly visible through binoculars high in our summer night sky. Our chart depicts a band of sky more than 50° wide and centred some 70° high in our SSE at midnight at present. Vega in Lyra is by far the most obvious star, though the equally-bright Arcturus in Bootes stands another 15° beyond the chart's right-hand border.

HD 162826, truncated to HD on our chart, lies 110 light years away in NE Hercules 9° to the W (right) of Vega and at the W end of a curving row of three stars. These are shown in the circle which is a magnified view of an area slightly larger than the Moon – star 90 is 90 Herculis which shines at magnitude 5.2, while HD is 6.5 and the star between them is 6.0. HD is 15% more massive than the Sun but whether it, too, hosts planets and life remains to be seen.

Very much more distant in Hercules are the globular star clusters M92 and, even more spectacular, M13. Appearing as fuzzy balls of light of mag 6.3 and 5.8, they lie about 16,000 and 25,000 light years away respectively and contain hundreds of thousands of ancient stars.

Further W lies Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown, and two very different variable stars. R usually shines near mag 6, the limit of naked-eye visibility. Since 2007, though, it has been some 1,500 times fainter near mag 14 because of soot forming in its atmosphere.

1057,"Update, 17 June: Despite leaving school with no qualifications, Chris Toumazou has just won this week's European inventor award. We meet the man behind the high-speed DNA test and profile the other finalists in this prestigious contest

For a man who left school with no qualifications, Chris Toumazou has done remarkably well in the intervening years. He is currently chief scientist of Imperial College London's Institute of Biomedical Engineering and holds more than 50 patents for medical diagnostic instruments and other devices. For good measure, he will discover on 17 June if he has won this year's prestigious European Inventor Award for his creation of a lab-on-a-chip technology, a system that can test for genetic disease and drug intolerances in patients in less than 30 minutes.

(Update: Toumazou was indeed the winner!)

It is a startling set of achievements, though Toumazou, who will be 53 next month, insists his breakthroughs have been based on the simplest approaches. ""I set out to create chips that used low-energy technology and that has allowed me to develop devices that can do all their data crunching on site.

""It is the very antithesis of big data, where you collect every bit of information that you can get hold of and send the lot to a processing centre, which gets clogged up in the process. We should be looking, as much as possible, at doing local analyses before transmitting results. I am completely opposed to the concept of big data.""

An example of this approach is provided by his Sensium pads, says Toumazou. The size of a large plaster, these are stuck, using simple adhesives, on patients' chests. They can then measure their heart rates, respiration, ECG signals and temperature. Crucially, these pads are cheap because of their low energy demands.

""You use them for a few days and then throw them away,"" he explains. ""They cost about £25. The US Food and Drug Administration has just approved them and I envisage Sensium pads being used with hospital patients who are recovering from operations. Instead of a ward sister going round checking each patient's health in the traditional manner, each will have a Sensium that will instantly raise the alarm if something goes wrong with a patient's heart rate or temperature.""

The invention of devices such as these forms an impressive technological pedigree. But coming, as they do, from someone who had such an inglorious start to his academic career, they represent an extraordinary change in circumstances. The son of Greek Cypriot immigrants, Toumazou failed his 11-plus and left school in Cheltenham at the age of 16. ""I just did not get on at my school. It completely failed to inspire me,"" he says.

A career in the family's catering business – ""kebab restaurants and fish and chip shops"", as he puts it – seemed inevitable. ""It was expected of me but I felt I should do something different and as I was interested in electricity I decided to study it at the local City and Guilds. I had a year there learning how to solder wires, which is ironic, as I can hardly fix a plug today.""

Toumazou did well, particularly on the theoretical side of his electrical studies. He took a two-year ordinary national diploma followed by a degree in engineering at Oxford Polytechnic, now Oxford Brookes University, and then a PhD. ""I was told I had written a good thesis, so I applied to Imperial College to do a post-doc and, to my disbelief, I was accepted.""

It was nothing to what was to come, however. Two years later, he was made a lecturer and then, three years after that, Toumazou – unencumbered by a single A-level – became professor of electrical engineering, the youngest professor ever appointed at Imperial. Somewhere along the road from Cheltenham, a man who once seemed destined for work in a kebab shop shifted from low to the highest possible gear and was now a major player at one of the world's most distinguished scientific centres.

""I worked really, really hard,"" he says. ""I wanted to achieve. I wanted to deliver. I enjoyed the creative side and certainly it has been an interesting journey. If nothing else, it has made my mum and dad very happy, especially when they met the Queen when she opened my Institute of Biomedical Engineering.""

When he started at Imperial in the late 80s, Toumazou's main interest was in microchips. ""But I was interested in analogue, not digital, electronics,"" he adds. ""Digital electronics is squashing signals into ones and zeros. But speech, sound and vision are all analogue signals, and in those days converting analogue to digital monopolised most of a device. I decided to find a way to make all that analogue conversion so that it could run on very, very low power, thus allowing you to make very small telephone devices.""

The biological world is analogue, of course, and Toumazou's philosophy meant he could create instruments that would interface between the living and the electronic. The first outcome was his work, a collaboration with other groups, on cochlear implants. Toumazou's low-energy analogue chips made it possible to create an implantable device that would restore hearing to a child born with a seriously impaired cochlea, who would otherwise have suffered profound deafness. After that, he developed the Sensium pad and later his DNA chip technology, goals to which Toumazou was driven with extra intensity when it was discovered his son Marcus had a genetic condition that was slowly destroying his kidneys.

""Marcus had to go on a dialysis machine for three years after he lost his kidneys. Then he had a transplant but lost this kidney six years later. Today he is 22 and back on dialysis. I learned the hard way how desperately primitive is the technology we have for monitoring the health of someone with a chronic illness. Again, that influenced my work.""

To improve health monitoring, Toumazou decided to try to put pieces of DNA in microchips and in doing so found he could make devices that would trigger signals when they came in contact with a particular DNA sample. ""I had found a way to create a chip that could recognise a genetic mutation in a DNA sample placed on it. The device can tell you if you have a predisposition to a disease or whether you can metabolise a medical drug or not. A GP can get a result from a patient in 15 to 20 minutes.""

To use the lab-on-a-chip system, a doctor takes a sample of their patient's saliva. DNA is extracted, certain gene sequences are amplified and, from these, an analysis can be displayed on a laptop in less than half an hour. ""You will be told then and there just how your patient will react to a drug,"" adds Toumazou. Those individuals won't have to come to your surgery to modify their dosage depending on their reactions to the drug.

""You will know how they will react from the results of the DNA chip test that you have just carried out. Or you could test if a person has a mutation that is triggering a particular set of symptoms. The crucial point is that by using this kind of technology we can get medical diagnoses that once took days or weeks in a few minutes.""

It remains Toumazou's most promising invention, though a stream of ideas continues to pour from him, including the creation of a range of genetically selected cosmetics for women, which he is marketing later this year with the former Duran Duran singer Nick Rhodes, under the title GeneU. ""That is strictly business, of course,"" he adds. ""My main work is still focused on turning the silicon technology into medical devices for the 21st century."" Robin McKie

Luigi Cassar

Self-cleaning concrete

Air pollution has become one of the major environmental problems for industrialised nations. Cities spend millions on restoring buildings damaged and discoloured by the fumes and millions more on the public health issues created by breathing in pollution day in, day out. With urban populations continuing to grow, the issue is only being exacerbated.

As a chemist, Luigi Cassar spent 20 years looking into the effects of air pollution and its implications on buildings and health. But it was during the 1990s, when he was working for a cement company, that he finally developed a solution that keeps buildings dirt-free and cleans the air. By adding the natural mineral titanium oxide to concrete, Cassar and his team were able to create a ""photocatalytic"" material. When sunlight hits the titanium oxide, it binds electrons, allowing the formation of hydrogen peroxide on the concrete's surface. This in turn interacts with the dirt and other organic substances and turns them into nitrates, which are then simply washed away by rainwater.

It was as a side-effect to this self-cleaning property that Cassar first noticed, while building a church from his material in 1996, how the new concrete also reduced the air pollution around the new building – by up to 70% in some cases. This new quality was quickly seized upon and its effect on reducing a major contribution in the formation of smog, nitrogen oxide, was confirmed in the lab. The application of 1,000 sq m of the cement is the equivalent of planting 80 trees.

Since then, the product has been incorporated into not only concrete, but also mortar, plaster and paint. Any wall covered in these materials is able not to just stay clean but continuously purify the air. Cassar reckons that if just 15% of surfaces in a city were coated, air pollution could be reduced by 50%. Josh Davis

Terese Alstin & Anna Haupt

Inflatable bike helmet

While Alstin and Haupt were studying industrial design at Sweden's Lund University, a national debate started as to whether or not it should be mandatory for adults to wear cycle helmets. In response, the pair decided to focus their thesis on seeing if they could come up with a helmet that people actually wanted to wear, mandatory or not.

With only 5%-20% of cyclists in Europe wearing a helmet, and cycling becoming ever more popular, the discussion over protective headgear continues to surface. After viewing data showing that people wanted a helmet that was stylish and safe, the two designers' solution seemed to ask the impossible – to make an ""invisible"" helmet. With the appearance of a simple scarf or collar, they created the Hövding, which, triggered by an impending crash, deploys an inflatable helmet that covers the wearer's head and neck.

It works by tracking the speed and position of the user through gyroscopes and accelerometers built into the collar. When a cyclist crashes or falls, they move in distinct ways, and when the sensors pick up the movements indicative of a crash, the airbag is deployed using helium. The airbag itself is made from a heavy-duty nylon that envelops the whole head like a hood, protecting those areas most vulnerable in a crash. In fact, tests have shown that the Hövding absorbs shocks three times better than regular helmets.

But the tech doesn't just end with the crash. While the helmets contain the necessary sensors to predict a fall, they also capture data immediately before and during the collision, like a mini-black box. This data can then be used by the team to better analyse real-life scenarios and is added to the growing body of data used to increase the helmet's predictive ability.

With only one use per helmet, and retailing at €400 each, it is clearly aimed at the high-end urban cyclist. But with the global market for cycle parts and accessories worth an estimated €36.4bn, the pair have tapped into a highly productive seam. JD



Charles W Hull

3D printer



Charles W Hull created the first 3D printed object in 1983. Photograph: epo.org

From parts of a jet plane to human kidneys, the uses for 3D printers are seemingly boundless. But it was to overcome a far simpler problem that in 1983 Charles W Hull created the first 3D printed object – an optometrist's cup.

Hull's problem, he says, was that ""it took a long time to prototype plastic parts which were eventually going to be plastic moulded"". It was a convoluted process in which he would have to send various designs to different producers and, even then, ""it would take six weeks or two months and you'd get your sample piece back and typically it wouldn't be quite right"", meaning he'd have to start the whole process again.

While using UV light to apply thin plastic veneers to table tops, Hull had a thought: could he use this technology to reduce the time it took to mould and manufacture small plastic prototypes from months to minutes? He set about trying.

""I had the general idea, and so where I worked I set up a lab in the back,"" he says. ""Probably, I don't remember exactly, but for a year... at nights and weekends, I finally got it all working.""

By overlaying thousands of these thin veneers, Hull found that he could use the UV light to harden successive layers of liquid plastic to create objects of almost any shape or complexity. He has termed this method ""stereolithography"".

Thirty years on and Hull is now the father of an industry worth $2.2bn. ""I realised the potential for the problem I was solving, but I certainly didn't realise the scope that 3D printing was going to take,"" he says.

While the technology has been used for years in the commercial sector, notably in manufacturing by the Ford Motor Company during the 1990s, Hull is in no way surprised that it's taken this long to break into the public sphere.

""Inventions take a long time to go mainstream; that's kind of typical,"" says Hull. ""I'd told my wife that it was going to take 25 years before everybody knows about this and it's been around 30.""

However, it's been the past few years that have seen the reach of the 3D printer multiply and this is what excites the inventor.

""The medical applications are really exciting – surgical implants, prostheses and tenfold [other] applications."" In the field of medicine, the technology has been seized upon in a way Hull never expected: from printing living stem cells, blood vessels and skin to moulding personalised dental implants, the industry is rapidly expanding.

This isn't the only development that excites Hull. ""The move into direct manufacturing has been going on for around five years now, and I think it's very exciting because that's what I originally worked on.""

But can we expect every home to have a 3D printer in the future?

""Personal printers are also rapidly expanding, so it's really a moving field in all directions. I'm not a futurist kind of person, but I would expect over time that it's just going to be real common.""

The monkish scholars of the Dark Ages and the universities of the Middle Ages are reminders that the rushlight of learning flickered even in the most benighted periods.

China makes a contribution, but always somehow at arm's length; India also appears in the narrative, albeit tangentially. And then the Renaissance happens, along with Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. The story of science thereafter cannot be separated from the the Reformation, the Age of Exploration, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and so on, but it can be told with a lot more emphasis on the ideas than on plague, fire and sword.

What makes Patricia Fara's book a surprise and a subversive pleasure is that her cast of characters contains all the usual suspects, but they don't necessarily emerge as heroes: she sees them as people of their time, fashioned by the ideas of their time. The second surprise and pleasure is that she sidesteps the temptation of the ""one damn thing after another"" version of history: this book is wittily organised into big propositions with laconic headings – Interactions, Experiments, Laws, Institutions, Invisibles – and each of these subdivides into smaller, bite-sized themes. Invisibles, for example, addresses the stories of things you cannot see: germs, rays, particles and so on).

This is the smorgasbord version of history: you can graze, and meet the same ingredients more than once, but each time in refreshingly different savours. Religion is a big part of Fara's story, but for her, religion was one historic way of attempting to understand the great questions of origin and identity, and in that sense is not separable from science. Science, too, could be abused in the way that the religious principles could be abused. The Victorians didn't necessarily dislike Darwin's ideas because he challenged the biblical version of creation: that had been challenged long before he turned up.

They disliked his arguments about sexual selection, because it allotted a key role to women (the flashy feathers of the male peacock attract superficial females looking for a mate.) And Darwin was a man of his time. ""Taking for granted that women are vain and shallow, he interpreted his observations to build up an argument that inevitably confirmed his original assumption."" Because his pronouncements carried the prestige of science they could be used to justify discrimination by allowing people to say that women are just made that way – there's no point fighting against nature.

Darwin turns up again in the chapter on genes, worrying that ""the reckless, degraded and often vicious members of society"" tended to increase at a quicker rate that the virtuous and provident, and this provides an opening for a short history of eugenics, beginning with his cousin Francis Galton and embracing Trofim Lysenko as well as Gregor Mendel and William Bateson.

This is the sort of approach that invariably gets called provocative. But that's the whole point of such brief histories: to provoke further thought, a closer interest, a re-examination, yet another look at how things came to be, and why. The journey from the invention of measurement and the accounting of time in Babylon 4,000 years ago to the atomic clock, the particle collider and the genetic sequencing machine can be seen as a procession of misunderstandings and blunders that happened to be more or less in the right direction, and Fara's sometimes sardonic telling helps highlight the greatness of the achievement, because the people who made such things happen were mostly so ordinarily human.

She draws on a vast array of other scholarly studies, but she makes this narrative her own, and often waspishly: Darwin gets yet another swift kick in her chapter on chemicals, a chapter that invokes Eve, post-feminist scientists, sickle cell anaemia, William Harvey and Dorothy Hodgkin.

All through the narrative, there are illustrations that serve as prompts for a little lecture on the way we once saw the world of natural philosophy, or see science now. So Maggi Hambling's oil canvas of the no-longer-young Hodgkin at her untidy desk offers her model of the insulin molecule as something that will ""endure forever as evidence of increasingly successful scientific research. In contrast, the half-eaten sandwich is destined to disintegrate, as is Hodgkin herself, whose human transience is emphasised by her gnarled hands …""

Epic political history tends inevitably to highlight the past (so that Genghis Khan, the Emperor Augustus and Napoleon look more like high achievers than, say, Silvio Berlusconi or David Cameron). Science history conversely tends to diminish the past: a journey from darkness into light. Of course Fara has more to say about the last 400 years than the first 3,000, but not all of it is respectful. We seem to have been fumbling in the half-light all along.

Her chapter on the environment traces a thread from Bougainville in Tahiti in 1768 to climate change by way of Capability Brown, Adolf Hitler, John Muir, Ernst Haeckel, Rachel Carson, the Bible and the media-sensitive scientists who have learned in the past 50 years that ""the best way of attracting public attention and government funding is to deliver apocalyptic prognoses – nuclear devastation, meteoric bombardment, an impending ice age, global warming. Modern scientific forecasters seem to fulfil the same psychological needs as religious prophets who preached that the end of the world represents God's punishment of the sinful.""

Did I say this book was provocative? My only regret is that I didn't buy the hardback five years ago, and my only complaint is that the paperback, at nearly 500 pages, won't lie open on the table.

1061,"As Brazil 2014 gathers momentum, spare a thought for the sapphire-tinted Spix’s macaw, a Brazilian endemic, now extinct in the wild and often referred to as the world’s rarest bird

Name: Spix’s macaw

Species: Cyanopsitta spixii

Dates: ?-1819

Claim to fame: The first ever Spix’s macaw, the world’s rarest bird

Where now: Bavarian State Collection of Zoology, Munich, Germany

Last week, I started a petition to FIFA to save the three-banded armadillo, a threatened Brazilian endemic that acted as inspiration for the World Cup’s chirpy animated mascot Fuleco. In the comments, ACarneiro described its dry forest habitat the Caatinga as “one of the most threatened ecosystems in Brazil” and mentioned that it was also once home to Spix’s macaw. This seemed like a perfect moment to tell you about the type specimen of this species.

On 16 April 1820, the Nova Amazonia left the Brazilian port of Belém at the mouth of the Amazon and set sail for Lisbon. Safely packed below deck was an impressive collection of insects, fish, mammals and birds and among them a dead parrot, a single specimen of Spix’s macaw, a species that would become known as the world’s rarest bird.

The specimen had been shot almost a year earlier on the banks of the São Francisco river near Juazeiro by the German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix. He must have seen more than one, for he recorded that “it lives in flocks” but he did recognise it as “very rare” and made a note of its “thin voice”.

Spix and his fellow explorer Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius had reached Rio de Janeiro in 1817 as part of an expedition in the name of the Emperor Francis I of Austria. According to Tony Juniper, author of Spix’s Macaw, Spix believed that the sapphire parrot from the Caatinga was another specimen of the Hyacinth macaw, a species he’d encountered throughout his travels in Brazil. In his Avium Brasiliensium Species Novae (published in 1824-25), he gave the rare blue parrot the name Arara hyacinthinus.

It was only after Spix’s death that Johann Wagler (Spix's one-time assistant and a zoologist at the University of Munich) published his Monographia Psittacorum, a work that recognised Spix’s dead parrot as a new species in its own right. He called it Sittace Spixii, literally Spix’s parrot, which subsequently evolved into the current nomenclature Cyanopsitta spixii. This act of branding suddenly gave this species scientific but also commercial value. “It intrigued … conservationists and collectors,” writes Juniper, “the former seeking to save the species, the latter to own and possess the most sought-after of all birds.”

Over the next century, several explorers and ornithologists attempted but failed to spot Spix’s macaw in its natural habitat, but local people obviously knew something that the outsiders didn’t, for hunters began to catch and supply live specimens to wealthy enthusiasts abroad. The species still survives but only in captivity, a paradox that acts as the premise for the 2011 animated movie Rio in which captive-born Blu and Jewel are the last Spix’s macaws on Earth. In the 2014 sequel – Rio 2 – the affectionate but mismatched pair find a lost tribe of Spix’s macaws in the wild.

If only.

Tale ends

Please consider signing my petition to FIFA to help protect the Caatinga, the former home of Spix’s macaw and one of the last strongholds of the three-banded armadillo (the species that inspired the World Cup mascot Fuleco).

Without further ado, here's the 2014 long list:

Serving the Reich: The Struggle for the Soul of Physics under Hitler by Philip Ball [The Bodley Head, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis Serving the Reich tells the story of physics under Hitler. While some scientists tried to create an Aryan physics that excluded any 'Jewish ideas', many others made compromises and concessions as they continued to work under the Nazi regime. Among them were three world-renowned physicists:



Max Planck, pioneer of quantum theory, regarded it as his moral duty to carry on under the regime.

Peter Debye, a Dutch physicist, rose to run the Reich's most important research institute before leaving for the United States in 1940.

Werner Heisenberg, discovered the Uncertainty Principle, and became the leading figure in Germany's race for the atomic bomb.

After the war most scientists in Germany maintained they had been apolitical or even resisted the regime: Debye claimed that he had gone to America to escape Nazi interference in his research; Heisenberg and others argued that they had deliberately delayed production of the atomic bomb.Mixing history, science and biography, Serving the Reich is a gripping exploration of moral choices under a totalitarian regime. Here are human dilemmas, failures to take responsibility, three lives caught between the idealistic goals of science and a tyrannical ideology.""An incredibly interesting look at the politics of science and the decisions all scientists have to make.""

Seven Elements That Have Changed The World: Iron, Carbon, Gold, Silver, Uranium, Titanium, Silicon by John Browne [Weidenfeld & Nicolson (an imprint of the Orion Publishing Group), 2014; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis Humans have put the Earth's resources to extraordinary use, but not always for the benefit of humankind. SEVEN ELEMENTS vividly describes how iron, carbon, gold, silver, uranium, titanium and silicon have shaped the world around us -- for good and for bad.

This book takes you on an adventure of human passion, ingenuity and discovery, but it is a journey that is far from over: we continue to find surprising new uses for each of these seven key elements. Discover how titanium pervades modern consumer society, how natural gas is transforming the global energy sector and how an innovative new form of carbon could be starting a technological revolution.

SEVEN ELEMENTS is a unique mix of science, history and politics, interwoven with the author's extensive personal and professional experience.

The judges said: ""An inspired look at seven very special elements which are essential to the modern world. It's a captivating read.""

Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age by W. Bernard Carlson [Princeton University Press, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/audio download UK/audio CD UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audible US/audio CD US]

Publisher's synopsis Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the 20th century. His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented.

In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an ""idealist"" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs.

The judges said: ""Full of lots of new messages, Carlson makes you stop and think about the practicalities of science, industry and invention.""



What a Wonderful World: One Man's Attempt to Explain the Big Stuff by Marcus Chown [Faber & Faber, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis Why do we breathe? What is money? How does the brain work? Why did life invent sex? Does time really exist? How does capitalism work -- or not, as the case may be? Where do mountains come from? How do computers work? How did humans get to dominate the Earth? Why is there something rather than nothing?

In What a Wonderful World, Marcus Chown, bestselling author of Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You and the Solar System app, uses his vast scientific knowledge and deep understanding of extremely complex processes to answer simple questions about the workings of our everyday lives. Lucid, witty and hugely entertaining, it explains the basics of our essential existence, stopping along the way to show us why the Atlantic is widening by a thumbs' length each year, how money permits trade to time travel why the crucial advantage humans had over Neanderthals was sewing and why we are all living in a giant hologram.

The judges said: ""Chown is a terrific science writer. His book is a tour de force that covers an incredible range of topics.""



Dice World: Science and Life in a Random Universe by Brian Clegg [Icon Books, 2014; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis As troubling as we pattern-seeking humans may find it, modern science has repeatedly shown us that randomness is the underlying heartbeat of nature. In Dice World, acclaimed science writer Brian Clegg takes readers on an incredible trip around our random universe, uncovering the truths and lies behind probability and statistics, explaining how chaotic intervention is behind every great success in business, and demonstrating the possibilities quantum mechanics has given us for creating unbreakable ciphers and undergoing teleportation. He explores how the 'clockwork universe' imagined by Newton, in which everything could be predicted given enough data, was disproved bit by bit, to be supplanted by chaos theory and quantum physics. Clegg reveals a world in which not only is accurate forecasting often impossible but probability is the only way for us to understand the fundamental nature of things. Forget the clockwork universe. Welcome to Dice World, a unique portrait of a startlingly complex cosmos, from the bizarre microscopic world of the quantum to the unfathomable mechanics of planetary movements, where very little is as it seems...

The judges said: ""A fantastic look at the importance of randomness, full of interesting and philosophical ideas while still remaining open and accessible.""



The Compatibility Gene by Daniel M Davis [Allen Lane, Penguin Press, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis In The Compatibility Gene, leading scientist Daniel M Davis tells the story of the crucial genes that define our relationships, our health and our individuality.

We each possess a similar set of around 25,000 human genes. Yet a tiny, distinctive cluster of these genes plays a disproportionately large part in how our bodies work. These few genes, argues Davis, hold the key to who we are as individuals and our relationship to the world: how we combat disease, how our brains are wired, how attractive we are, even how likely we are to reproduce.

The Compatibility Gene follows the remarkable history of these genes' discovery. From the British scientific pioneers who struggled to understand the mysteries of transplants to the Swiss zoologist who devised a new method of assessing potential couples' compatibility based on the smell of worn T-shirts, Davis traces a true scientific revolution in our understanding of the human body: a global adventure spanning some sixty years.

The judges said: ""Davis wins you over from the start with touch points you can relate to and engaging descriptions. Dedication and a life spent in pursuit of his subject are evident on every page.""

My Brief History by Stephen Hawking [Transworld, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/audio CD UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audible US/audio CD US]

Publisher's synopsis Stephen Hawking has dazzled readers worldwide with a string of bestsellers exploring the mysteries of the universe. Now, for the first time, the most brilliant cosmologist of our age turns his gaze inwards for a revealing look at his own life and intellectual evolution.

My Brief History recounts Stephen Hawking's improbable journey, from his post-war London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity. Lavishly illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty and candid account introduces readers to a Hawking rarely glimpsed in previous books: the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him 'Einstein'; the jokester who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a black hole; and the young husband and father struggling to gain a foothold in the world of academia.

Writing with characteristic humility and humour, Hawking opens up about the challenges that confronted him following his diagnosis of motor neurone disease aged twenty-one. Tracing his development as a thinker, he explains how the prospect of an early death urged him onwards through numerous intellectual breakthroughs, and talks about the genesis of his masterpiece A Brief History of Time -- one of the iconic books of the twentieth century.

Clear-eyed, intimate and wise, My Brief History opens a window for the rest of us into Hawking's personal cosmos.

The judges said: ""Hawking writes incredibly poetically, conjuring evocative images in your mind. My Brief History takes you on a journey of adversities and shows you what has made Hawking one of the most respected theoretical physicists in the world today.""



The Perfect Theory: A Century of Geniuses and the Battle over General Relativity by Pedro G. Ferreira [Little, Brown Book Group, 2014; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audio CD US]

Publisher's synopsis Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is possibly the most perfect intellectual achievement in modern physics. Anything that involves gravity, the force that powers everything on the largest, hottest or densest of scales, can be explained by it.

From the moment Einstein first proposed the theory in 1915, it was received with enthusiasm yet also with tremendous resistance, and for the following ninety years was the source of a series of feuds, vendettas, ideological battles and international collaborations featuring a colourful cast of characters.

A gripping, colourfully told story, A Perfect Theory entangles itself with the flashpoints of modern history. In this first complete popular history of the theory, Pedro G. Ferreira shows how the theory has informed our understanding of exactly what the universe is made of and how much is still undiscovered: from the work of the giant telescopes in the deserts of Chile to the way in which the latest work on black holes is providing a fresh, new perspective on what space and time are truly made of. As we near the first centenary of Einstein's iconic theory, scientists the world over are wondering once again if we have reached the limits of the theory and just how much of the universe's future it can explain.

The judges said: ""Very lucidly written, Ferreira succeeds in a explaining some very tricky concepts. A treasure trove of information.""



The Cancer Chronicles: Unlocking Medicine's Deepest Mystery by George Johnson [The Bodley Head, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audible US]

Publisher's synopsis When the woman he loved was diagnosed with a metastatic cancer, science-writer George Johnson embarked on a journey to learn everything he could about the disease and the people who dedicate their lives to understanding and combating it. What he discovered is that a revolution is now under way -- an explosion of new ideas about what cancer really is and where it comes from.

He combs through the realms of epidemiology, clinical trials, laboratory experiments and scientific hypotheses, to reveal what we know and don't know about cancer, showing why a cure remains such a slippery concept. His luminous accounts describe tumors that evolve like alien creatures inside the body, paleo-oncologists who uncover petrified tumors clinging to the skeletons of dinosaurs and ancient human ancestors, and the surprising reversals in science's comprehension of the causes of cancer, with the foods we eat and environmental toxins playing a lesser role. Perhaps most fascinating of all is how cancer borrows natural processes involved in the healing of a wound or the unfolding of a human embryo and turns them against the body.

Throughout his pursuit, Johnson illuminates the human experience with elegiac grace, bearing witness to the punishing gauntlet of consultations, surgeries, targeted therapies and other treatments. Provocative and intellectually vibrant, The Cancer Chronicles will challenge everything you thought you knew about the disease -- and provide hope for tomorrow and the future.

The judges said: ""A scrupulously researched, well written book that makes excellent use of case studies.""



Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live by Marlene Luk [W.W. Norton, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/audio download UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audible US]

Publisher's synopsis Theories about how our ancestors lived -- and why we should emulate them -- are often based on pseudoscience and speculation rather than actual research. Taking us to the cutting edge of biology, the author explains that evolution can work faster than was previously realised, meaning that we are not biologically the same as our caveman ancestors. Zuk shows how our visions of an ideal evolutionary past in which we ate, lived and reproduced as we were ""meant to"" can lead us astray and distract us from more interesting considerations of how we differ from our forebears. Along the way, she debunks the caveman diet, discusses whether we're really designed to run barefoot and considers modern-day courtship and child-rearing practices in the context of how our ancestors lived.

The judges said: ""Paleofantasy presents an interesting thesis that feels fresh in a very accessible way. The book represents an argument against the accepted wisdom of our time.""

Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World by Mark Miodownik [Viking (an imprint of Penguin Books), 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]

Publisher's synopsis Why is glass see-through? What makes elastic stretchy? How come concrete pours? Why does a paperclip bend? Why does any material look and behave the way it does?

From the towering skyscrapers of our cities to the most ordinary objects in our homes, Stuff Matters tells enthralling stories that explain the science and history of materials we take entirely for granted, while introducing some of humankind's most ingenious and improbable inventions.

From the tea-cup to the jet engine, the silicon chip to the paper clip, the plastic in our appliances to the elastic in our underpants, world-leading materials scientist Mark Miodownik reveals the miracles of engineering and ingenuity that permeate every aspect of our lives. Along the way, he introduces materials that can heal themselves, implants that become living bone, the explosive that made the movie business, materials that might one day save the world -- and others that already have.

The judges said: ""A contemporary, sideways look at everyday stuff. Miodownik writes with a passionate ability to explain each subject. It's packed full of excellent stories and is the only science book out there where the author gets stabbed on the London Underground!""

Gulp: Adventures of the Alimentary Canel by Mary Roach [Oneworld, 2013; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/audio CD UK; Amazon US/kindle US/audio CD US]

Publisher's synopsis Eating is the most pleasurable, gross, necessary, unspeakable biological process we humans undertake. But very few of us realise what strange wet miracles of science operate inside us after every meal -- let alone have pondered the results (of the research). How have physicists made crisps crispier? What do laundry detergent and saliva have in common? Was self-styled 'nutritional economist' Horace Fletcher right to persuade millions of people that chewing a bite of shallot 700 times would yield double the vitamins? And did Elvis actually die from constipation?

In her trademark, laugh-out-loud style, Mary Roach breaks bread with spit connoisseurs and enema exorcists, stomach slugs, rectum-examining prison guards, and competitive hot dog eaters as she investigates the beginning -- and the end -- of our food.

The judges said: ""An entertaining and disarming read which delves into a usually unspeakable topic with great humour and great insight.""

1065,"White laboratory coats, traditionally thought of as a sign of authority and competence, are a necessary part of the lives of some scientists - but not all. Indeed, as the latest stories on female Lego scientists have emerged, I am delighted to find that two of the three have escaped the stereotyping and are not wearing lab coats – only the chemist has donned the snowy gown and, to my mind at least, rightly so.

I am a scientist, and have been for several years now, but I have never had cause to wear a lab coat for my work. I imagine lab coats to be reserved for those scientists handling particular materials like chemicals or biological materials, for example. True, sometimes psychologists need to handle these materials, but my personal research has never called for them, instead being based in behavioural experimentation.

This brings me to the problem I face when invited to speak at Soapbox Science, an annual science communication event for women in academia. This year it takes place in several locations around the UK, and I am one of 12 scientists fortunate enough to be chosen to talk about my research at Bristol’s Harbourside Festival of Nature on June 14th.

The essence of Soapbox Science is much the same as Speaker’s Corner in London: to take a public area and turn it into an arena designed to bring science directly to passers-by. The key point is that you do this without the aid of slideshows and exciting paraphernalia. It is also a celebration of the diversity of scientists, bringing together female academics from varied fields in the hope of inspiring young women (and men) to consider a career in the sciences.

A traditional part of the event is that participating scientists stand on their soapbox clad in a white laboratory coat; however, I will not be wearing a lab coat during my time on the soapbox. I have no problem with this in principle, but since I have never had cause to wear one in the course of my research to me wearing one would feel a lie. I suppose you could say I could wear one anyway for the sake of tradition of the event, or perhaps because it’s a recognisable stereotype that will identify me to the crowd. But there is a very important reason that I and most other psychologists don't wear one, ever. I vividly remember the undergraduate lecture where I first heard the story of psychologist Stanley Milgram, and of the serious implication that lab coats produce a particular environmental effect that is less than ideal for psychological experiments.

In 1961 Milgram, then a psychologist at Yale University, began a series of experiments designed to measure obedience and conformity. In the wake of the Second World War he wanted to understand the behaviours and social influences associated with committing harmful acts at the behest of an authority figure. His experiments included an “impassive...and somewhat stern” male scientist, wearing what was described as a “grey technicians coat”, instructing volunteers to electrocute their test partners with a lethal electrical charge if they got a question wrong.

The ‘test partner’ was in fact a confederate actor feigning pain – but by the test end 65% of volunteers had effectively killed the stranger. Interestingly, when Milgram polled psychology students and professors prior to the experiment they believed only a very small number of volunteers, between 1 and 3%, would be prepared to inflict the lethal punishment asked of them.

What’s important here is that Milgram’s authority figure was a stern male scientist in a laboratory coat – a stereotypical image most of us are familiar with. A study from Leicester University in 2000 demonstrated that of 1200 primary school children asked to draw a scientist the majority drew a white man with facial or eccentric hair wearing a white jacket. Almost 15 years later in our own outreach work at the School of Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol little has changed. Of over 1000 school children asked to draw a scientist most drew a spectacled man in a lab coat, and just one drew a woman (in a lab coat, of course).

All of this paints an interesting picture of our perception of the stereotypical scientist. Not only do we imagine the authority of a scientist is so great that we would kill another human being at their request, but we succumb to this authority far more often than we would estimate. Milgram taught us how extreme the effects of authority can be on the way we think and behave – even while we do not suspect the effects of a white lab coat. This shaped the world of psychological experimentation, and still stands today as I work with my human participants lab-coat-free.

I am pretty confident that I am not the only one at the moment who believes that it is high time for breaking down the barriers to a scientific career, whether that barrier be gender or the clichéd archetype of a serious scientist. This Saturday I will stand on a soapbox as a scientist, as a woman, having never donned a lab coat, determined to show every person that comes within earshot that anyone can be a scientist.

1069,"In the early days of palaeontology, the dinosaurs were a clear anomaly compared to other known animals (both alive and extinct). Just how could such huge creatures have found enough to eat, or even supported themselves when on land? Misunderstanding about their limbs (many people had them as lizard-like sprawlers, rather than the upright posture we now know they possessed) didn’t help, but discoveries of giants such as Diplodocus and Apatosaurus led to speculative ideas on what such bulk would mean for their biology.

One popular idea was that the larger dinosaurs lived primarily in rivers, lakes and swamps, using the water to buoy them up and quite literally take the weight off their feet. Various aspects of the anatomy of some were supposed to support this – the nostrils at the top of the head of Brachiosaurus were thought to let it breathe while it was otherwise submerged, and the deep tails of the hadrosaurs were supposed to help them swim. This general hypothesis for aquatic living was actually rather quickly dismissed in some quarters but has dragged on interminably, and even now one can still buy books that show big dinosaurs lolling in deep water and this idea also comes back around in the media periodically as well.

Certainly some dinosaurs spent quite some time in and around water. Spinosaurus and its relatives ate fish, and show isotopic signatures in their teeth that indicate they spent a lot of time in water. Plenty of dinosaurs are preserved in the sediments from ancient rivers and lakes, and while this might well have been at least in part from floods, or animals dying near water (to be preserved you generally have to be buried and that often means water), some must have been hanging around bodies of water regularly to be buried. The armoured ankylosaurs especially seem to have favoured estuaries and coastlines given how often their bones are found in deposits laid down in the sea, and others appear to have died on a shoreline or may even have drowned when crossing a river.

Aside from the obvious problem of finding enough 50 foot deep lakes for big dinosaurs to live in (in those old artworks every lake is conveniently just deep enough for them to have their heads on the surface), the biggest problem with the aquatic dinosaurs idea is that they would float! It is hard to walk around on the bottom of a lake if you are on the surface. Pretty much all tetrapods are less dense than water and you can only get so deep before your feet lift off the bottom and dinosaurs were no different. In fact the largest dinosaurs, the sauropods (these include things like Diplodocus) has numerous air-filled bones and might have floated quite high in the water.

Even so, this would not inhibit their ability to move around when in water and it is safe to assume most, if not all, dinosaurs could swim. Very few animals are incapable of propelling themselves through the water (even if very poorly) and dinosaurs presumably did so as well. Although a number are highly controversial, there are at least some fossil tracks that show dinosaurs moving around in water. Footprints left in water show clear tracks and every toe is clearly in evidence, and then over a number of steps the prints become less and less deeply impressed in the substrate until finally there are just the tips of the claws showing, and then a return of the toes and finally whole feet. This would occur as the animal waded out, swum a few strokes with the toes barely touching down, and then on reaching the other side or perhaps a sandbar, the water was shallow enough for it to walk again and the tracks return.

Dinosaurs did then hang around water, and could swim, but how about becoming specialised as aquatic animals, such as hippos, otters or even crocodiles? Here there are few credible candidates (the spinosaurs might be one, but this is controversial), since there are a number of consistent characteristics we would expect to see in water-living animals, and they simply are not present in dinosaurs. Swimming and diving animals generally have their nostrils and eyes high up on their heads so they can see and breathe while still otherwise submerged, they generally have a streamlined body to reduce drag, a flattened and flexible tail for propulsion, and broad and spreading toes (generally webbed too) to help them swim.

Aquatic and semi-aquatic animals also tend to have more dense bones than other animals so that they do not float so high in the water, and as noted already, most dinosaurs have less dense bones than other vertebrates, so that is immediately a big strike against them being aquatic. Some dinosaurs do appear to have had retracted nostrils, but in the absence of any other features, (including raised eyes) this is hardly a great argument. Similarly, many did have deep tails, but these were not the flexible tails of swimmers, but bound together with strong tendons that would have limited lateral movement. Some also have well-spread toes, but there is no good evidence of webbing between them, and animals like hadrosaurs had hooves that would be dreadful in water or on soft ground, but ideal for walking on relatively hard surfaces.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Plenty of aquatic reptiles were in the water during the time of the non-avian dinosaurs such as this dolphin-like icthyosaur Photograph: Alamy

The waters of the Mesozoic were teeming with reptile life though, both in the seas and freshwater environments. In addition to crocodilians and turtles and terrapins of various kinds, and more familiar animals like plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, at different times a huge raft of other reptiles took to the water including placodonts, phytosaurus, thalattosaurs and nothosaurs. That the non-avian dinosaurs were not aquatic animals, and do not appeared to have ever produced a real aquatic form, does seem like an oddity given their long period of life on Earth (mammals have produced the whales and their relatives, dugongs and manatees, and semi-aquatic forms like seals, otters, tapir, shrews, hippos and more all in the last 50 or so million years) though perhaps they faced strong competition at various times and simply never made it.

In short, dinosaurs were like the vast majority of terrestrial animals around today. Their habitats would have included water in the forms of rivers, lakes, and the sea, and numerous species would have needed to enter or cross bodies of water regularly. While many would have likely been capable swimmers, they were not aquatic animals spending the vast majority of their time in water, didn’t primarily eat water plants (as is seen by their strong teeth and stomach contents), and it is unlikely they used the water as a safe haven from predators. Until the birds took to the air (and indeed ventured into the water again), dinosaurs were very much creatures of dry land.",Were dinosaurs all at sea?,http://www.theguardian.com,[Dr Dave Hone],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/22/1385119187491/4b2394ed-ef2d-4a19-9fce-6d26f1a33fdd-620x372.png?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=772a77a4d152eccf9d7063f86486b7cc,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/jun/16/were-dinosaurs-all-at-sea
1071,"Join our discussion with the UK science minister David Willetts on Monday 16 June, 12-2pm BST, about how the government should invest the £5.9bn it has committed to spend on research infrastructure over the next five years

How should the government invest in research? The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) wants to know and has launched a consultation exercise to gather the views of anyone who would like to have a say. The consultation is largely aimed at the major stakeholders — universities, research organisations, research charities and learned societies — but here at the Guardian science blog network, we wanted to broaden the conversation to include the general public.

The consultation is specifically related to the recently announced plans for capital expenditure over the next five years, which will decide spending on equipment, buildings and facilities (see video). There is a commitment to invest £1.1 billion each year for 2016-2021, which in real terms will amount to £5.9 bn. This is a lot of money and the decisions are likely to shape the research landscape for the foreseeable future. Although the recurrent budget that pays for researcher salaries, consumables and suchlike is not included in the present exercise, the choices made on which facilities and projects to support may well influence that funding stream.

The consultation document (PDF) is actually quite readable but still comes across as rather technical, as does the accompanying questionnaire. It asks about important but complex issues such as the split in spending between small and large-scale projects, how to foster interactions with industry and how to balance the national interest with investment in international collaborations.

Perhaps in the face of such questions you are happy to leave it to the professionals? Polling by Ipsos Mori suggests many are. But the decisions to be made will affect our capacity to research in areas as diverse as particle physics, climate science, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, social science and the emerging applications of big data. In a modern democracy we think it’s healthier for taxpayers and voters to have their say.

To facilitate this we will be hosting a live online Q&A right here on Mon 16th June. We have lined up a panel of discussants including David Willetts, the minister for universities and science, and several other experts in various branches of science, science policy and history, all of whom will be interested to hear your views and to discuss any questions you might have about the capital investment plans.

The aim here is not to reduce the decision-making process to a popular vote but to foster a broader, deeper dialogue about the future direction of UK research. To get the conversation started we will be launching a series of posts on Guardian science blog network over the next few days to outline the aims of the consultation and present the research and policy context from a variety of perspectives.

There are lots of tricky issues to be considered and this is very much an experiment. But, as Jon Butterworth has already written, ‘this is important’. We look forward to the discussion.

The panel will be gathering online from 12-2 pm BST on Monday 16th June to discuss the BIS capital consultation. Among other questions, we’d like to debate:

What should be the UK’s priorities for large scale capital investments?

Are there new areas where the UK should be investing?

How should funding be allocated to different levels of activity: lab projects, institutions, national and international collaborations?

How should we maximise collaboration and equipment sharing?

How should the public be involved in deciding priorities?

What should be done to keep the public informed about UK research?

The live Q&A is open to all and will take place in the comments section below this article. Please create a Guardian comment account to join in.

1073,"Resource challenges are highly interconnected. Can the idea of a food-energy-water 'nexus' become more than another buzzword, and help us to identify solutions?

The dramatic spike in resource use over the last two decades, particularly in the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, has exacerbated the threat of resource scarcity. And the world’s failure to curb emissions of greenhouse gases means that the impacts of climate change will be felt strongly across food, water and energy – the three dimensions of the ""nexus"".

It is unsurprising there are increasing calls for innovative ways of approaching these problems. In recent years, the nexus approach has attracted significant interest from international organisations, the private sector and other global players as a way of tackling the interdependencies between water, energy and food security.

The urgent need for joined up approaches to policy and practice lies at the heart of nexus thinking. It’s an approach which applies at all levels of society; from local competition over access to water for irrigation or livestock, to global connections between policy on biofuels, food and water security.

Sometimes there are synergies, where changes in one area lead to improvements in another. More often, the trade-offs are negative: for example, the increased use of fertilisers to enhance food production leading to higher energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution of surface and underground water. Such trade-offs are often poorly understood, unanticipated or overlooked.

The nexus approach has gained momentum over the past five years and has been the focus of a number of international conferences, including the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference and a Nexus 2014 conference hosted by the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina in March 2014. The most recent report of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change features the ""Water-Energy-Food/Feed/Fibre Nexus as Linked to Climate Change"" as a cross-chapter theme. And the nexus features in proposals for the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (for example, the ""integrating approach"" advocated by the Colombian government), which are currently being debated by the UN.

The importance of the nexus is also increasingly recognised by the private sector. Joined up approaches by business can result in increased efficiency, for example by turning waste outputs from food production into useful inputs to energy generation (creating a ""circular economy"").

Complex global supply chains require increasingly sophisticated risk management approaches, and nexus thinking is compatible with the way many businesses now approach corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Large oil and gas companies have long talked of the ""resource trilemma"" and Shell includes the ""stress nexus"" in its most recent planning scenarios. The brewing giant SABMiller is attempting to make business decisions through a resource nexus lens, and recently highlighted, through a valuation study of malting barley in Rajasthan, the need for better approaches to handling trade-offs between water, energy and food and the company.

In its 2011 report on the nexus, the World Economic Forum argues that “Any strategy that focuses on one part of the water-food-energy nexus without considering its interconnections risks serious unintended consequences.” But despite growing enthusiasm for nexus approaches, uptake and implementation face considerable obstacles. Tools and approaches for operationalising the nexus at different scales require development and testing. There is uncertainty about what a ""successful"" nexus approach looks like in practice, and how it can be achieved and evaluated.

These are similar to the implementation challenges faced by other approaches, such as sustainable development and integrated water resources management, which have often failed to deliver in practice. Obstacles to nexus integration include siloed government departments, sector-based agencies that complicate coordination, restrictive funding mechanisms, legislative and regulatory barriers. A recent example of a more integrated approach in the UK is the creation of the Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil, within the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which aims to coordinate the various government bodies that will oversee future development of shale gas and oil.

So where is the nexus agenda leading? How can it become more than another interesting but unrealised buzzword? A pragmatic and practical agenda is required. Perhaps what makes the nexus different to earlier calls for integrated thinking, and the reason it has gained such momentum, is the magnitude of resource use and rate of global environmental change. Society can no longer ignore the fact that the resource challenges we face are highly interconnected. Business as usual is no longer sustainable; radical change and new thinking are required.

1075,"Going into business with those close to you means the potential for rows between relatives. Here's how to keep relations on track

According to the Institute for Family Business, two in three of all private sector firms are family-owned, with the vast majority of these SMEs. Only approximately one third of family-owned businesses survive into the second generation, with just 12% remaining ""viable"" by the third. Disputes over profits, business goals, transparency, philanthropy, company legacy and succession can all take their toll.

As one of Britain's longest running family businesses, formed in 1793 by James Ormiston in the city of London, Ormiston Wire is still going strong under the stewardship of myself, his sixth-generation descendant. We have maintained longevity by adapting to changes in environment and always looking to take steps forward, not back. So what advice would I offer to a younger family business?

Like any other business, a family-owned company must still meet the needs of its customers. If you don't keep sight of that and just keep making what you've always made in order to preserve the traditions of the family business, there is the potential to all go wrong. Many businesses, family-owned or otherwise, often fail to evolve to meet product development opportunities within their industry. You have to keep an eye on customer trends and be prepared to diversify or change what you do. In the competitive business world, evolution is as important as innovation.

Family businesses are always potential melting pots for disputes and rows between relations, as any viewer of television dramas about family businesses from Dallas to Howard's Way will know. The important thing is to make sure the family is behind you. Our family is made up of shareholders, all of whom are supportive and are given the opportunity to raise any issues at our regular shareholders' meetings. Just as I listen to our customers, I listen to them which is one reason we've survived as a family-owned business. The key is to keep the two-way communication going so that no issues are allowed to build up without being aired.

Family-run SMEs face many tests, some of which may risk operation. The 150th anniversary of the company, which occurred during the second world war, was sadly marred by the factory being bombed. However, with such a heritage to preserve, the Ormiston family relocated and rebuilt the business. When problems threaten the business it is important for the family to get stuck in and persevere.

Isolation can occur relatively easily to family-run businesses. Good communication within the business is vital, but it is also healthy to build business networks with objective groups outside of the business. Essentially offering advice and support, these networks may help with understanding changes to legislation and new product range opportunities. Decisions must be made from within the company, but being open to outside advice may turn a good decision into a great one.

For a family business to last over six generations, you have to learn to specialise and innovate to continue to grow as a company. During my stewardship of Ormiston Wire I've seen a wide range of problems surface, but the key is to be agile, whether the problem is related to a product, an unpredictable incident or a family member.

Self-publishing is becoming an increasingly popular way for authors to get their work into print. While the practice was once thought of as less prestigious than being published by the ""traditional"" powerhouses of publishing, self-publishing has come to represent a viable alternative to the mainstream industry, and as a result, a new outlet for authors and SMEs supporting the industry to gain revenue.

New technologies have played a role in the rising popularity of self-publishing, with ebook titles seeing large increases alongside their paper-based counterparts.

In this live Q&A authors, self-publishing services and industry experts will discuss the business aspects of self-publishing and its potential as a primary source of income for authors. We'll also be exploring how SMEs are using their expertise to branch into publishing books to share their knowledge with industry peers and their target audience.

1081,"On the eve of his return to Wimbledon as champion, Andy Murray should not only be the face of British tennis – which he undeniably is – he should be inspiring unprecedented interest in the game, and the evidence for that is less obvious.

Responding to widespread concerns that the Lawn Tennis Association has missed the boat with Murray, Michael Downey, who succeeded Roger Draper as the LTA’s chief executive six months ago, admitted on Friday it had yet to agree with the player the best way to use his success over the past two years as an engine for promoting the game.

The LTA announced on Thursday that weekly participation was up year on year by 3% from 423,400 in April last year to 434,600. Monthly participation is up year on year by 10%, from 766,500 in April last year to 840,600.

That is the good news. The not so good news is that the LTA is no nearer to nailing an agreement with this country’s best player since Fred Perry on how best to use his inspiring victory to encourage young people to play tennis.

“I haven’t spent an awful lot of time with Andy,” Downey admitted. “I met up with him at the Davis Cup [in Naples]. I wanted to hook up this week and we haven’t. We want to go into discussions with Andy, but it’s all about how to use his brand. His name’s out there. We got great participation numbers yesterday, and I’m sure Andy had something to do with that.

“But the key, with Andy’s approval, is using his brand in a way to help a young prospect to come up and say: ‘I want to be the next Andy Murray.’ But there’s got to be a strategy behind it, to say, what’s the best way of using this powerful brand called Andy Murray?”

Asked why so little has been done with Murray in the 12 months since he won Wimbledon, Downey said: “He did, and we expect him to do very, very well. He’s not going away. But it’s also about using him in a way that can make a real difference, growing participation or helping on the high-performance side.

“If I was Andy Murray, I’d want to know that too: ‘Have you researched that in a way that’s really going to make a difference? Because if I’m going to make a time commitment to help the sport in this nation I want to know that I’m going to be used in the right manner.’

“I wasn’t around a year ago, so I can’t talk about a year ago. And I’ll also say that we’re a little short of senior staff right now. We also know that Andy has had his own priorities, coming off surgery, looking for a coach, all those things. But we also believe that he’s not going away. He’s a brand. It’s no different than Coca-Cola or Highland Spring or whatever; you want to use that brand for the best benefit. If I’m Andy Murray, that’s what I want to knowtoo: that you’ve actually thought this through, because my time’s valuable and I want to make a difference.

“I haven’t had a discussion with Andy about that, at all. I’ve raised it with his agent to say we think it’s a valuable tool, and it’s also about tennis in Great Britain. It’s not about the LTA. It’s about promoting why people should play tennis in Great Britain. The brand is tennis. The brand is not the LTA.”

If that sounded vague, British tennis, nevertheless, made a significant appointment on Friday when it handed responsibility for seeking out the next generation of players to the 60-year-old Australian coach, Bob Brett, an appointment that has been greeted with general approval.

Brett, who coached Boris Becker and Marin Cilic and was among candidates to work with Murray, is the LTA’s first director of player development. Downey said that Brett – who worked with him for seven years when he did a similar job as a consultant to the Canadian federation – would have as his core responsibility the development of high-performance coaches and promising young players.

“We need to change,” Downey said. “That doesn’t mean you’re throwing the baby out with bath water and a lot of that change is cultural, more than anything else. That’s at the heart of it: what does it take to help a kid exceed expectations? That’s what Bob’s about. He knows that not every prospect out there is going to be an Andy Murray. But if we help others exceed their expectations, we’ve done our job.

“But we cannot grow participation on our own. There 24,000 courts in this country. We have to work with other people. We have to facilitate. That’s going to the success formula: working with partners. Bob wants our national coaches once in a while going into a school, into a park. It’s good for them to do that. It’s about giving back.”

Brett, who starts work in September, has just finished a 60-day review of the LTA and agreed to a full-time job after “looking under the hood” of British tennis, Downey said.

He will be on a regular employment contract, with no fixed term, and would “start when the sun comes up and leave when the last kid leaves the court”. One of the key areas he will address is “mental toughness”, which Brett thinks is lacking in a lot of young players.

He will not exclude “difficult parents” from the discussion. “Back home in Canada, Bob used to say: ‘The last person a young player talks to is one of his or her parents.’ So, If you think you’re going to get in between the kid and the parents, it’s probably not where you’re going to be helping them. We’ve got to learn to work with them.”

The tone of his remarks suggests the LTA will continue the drift away from the previous regime’s dependence on expensive international coaches, such as Brad Gilbert and Paul Annacone, and look more closely at the grassroots, working with independent clubs and coaches.

“Bob sees it as a challenge,” Downey said. “That’s why he wants to take it on. But he also knows it’s not something that can be done on a part-time basis. It says a lot about him. It’s about coming back to basics. He thinks we’ve got too many bells and whistles. It’s about attention to detail, hard work and commitment. He, like many other coaches around the world, knows what it takes to get there.”

Downey refused to put a time-scale on the success or otherwise of his appointment. “I think we’ve learned a lesson about making grandiose statements about where we’re going to go as a sport in this country,” he said, in reference to the repeated claims by his predecessor, Roger Draper, which flew in the face of all the evidence.

“What he wants to do is evolve the culture of high-performance tennis in Great Britain. How you define and measure that is going to be tough to do.

“It’s very difficult to predict when a player is going to have a breakthrough. But it’s going to take some time to get the fundamentals in place.”

The Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said: “Look at the men’s side. The rankings don’t lie, with only Andy in the top 100. We’ve got to continually strive to get more Tour players on the circuit. I still believe there’s a chance for Dan Evans and James Ward [who went out after one win apiece at Queen’s this week]. I think Kyle Edmund’s got a good chance of getting there. He’s on the right track and got the right attitude to do it, as well.

“We’ve got more guys inside the top 250. We’ve got to get more Challenger level players, which seems to be the case now. We’ve got to get that group moving forwards. And obviously the Davis Cup is better than it was three or four years ago.

“Bob will bring a level of expertise that we don’t have currently. But I think it would be wrong to think that Bob will come in and work with Dan, James and Kyle and wave the magic wand. It’s not about that. It’s about trying to change the culture, getting down to the high-performance centres, working with the 10, 11 and 12 years age-groups, to make a difference with the coaching at that level.”",LTA seeks best way of tapping into Andy Murray’s powerful brand,http://www.theguardian.com,[Kevin Mitchell],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402666626336/Andy-Murray-Britains-No1--014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=734b2bd41a900232244f8c351b0c2115,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/13/lta-andy-murray-brand-tennis-michael-downey-bob-brett

1085,"Long renowned as a race that offers drama throughout its mighty challenge, the 82nd edition of the Le Mans 24 Hours presented a script of twists and turns that ebbed and flowed across the Circuit de la Sarthe with gleeful abandon. Very pleasingly, at its heart there was a classic motor racing fable.

Audi, dominant here for so long, found themselves in the unusual position of being billed as the tortoise, to the hares of Toyota and Porsche. With all three manufacturers adopting different approaches to energy recovery systems that have cut fuel usage by up to 30% this year, the latter had the edge in pace but when the 24 hours had counted down it was for the 13th time in 16 years an Audi that crossed the line in first place.

The No2 R18 e-tron quattro of Benoît Tréluyer, Marcel Fässler and André Lotterer completed 379 laps to take the flag, the crews’ third win after victories in 2011 and 2012, a remarkable honour they share with Leena Gade, who in 2011 became the first female race engineer to win the 24. They were followed home by the No1 Audi of Tom Kristensen, Lucas di Grassi and Marc Gene, a feat in itself for a car that had been entirely rebuilt after Wednesday’s practice session, when it had been left in pieces after a huge accident with Loïc Duval at the wheel at the Porsche Curves.

“It was a race of the kind you can only experience at Le Mans,” said Audi’s head of motorsport, Dr Wolfgang Ullrich. “In Porsche and Toyota we had two really strong rivals who, as expected, did not make life easy for us.”

Indeed they did not and it was a one-two of which the team will be extraordinarily proud, especially given the quality of the opposition – with all three manufacturers holding the lead at various periods throughout the race – and one that reinforces the simple fact of modern endurance competition, that to win this race you have to beat Audi to the line. A salutary lesson from the tortoise team, who showed a never-say-die attitude and a fair turn of pace by the end, despite fine efforts from both Toyota and Porsche.

It was the Toyota TS040 that was expected to dominate and for the initial period of the race it appeared the Japanese marque would take the honours. The No8 of Anthony Davidson, Nicolas Lapierre and Sébastien Buemi had won the first two rounds of the World Endurance Championship, at Silverstone and then Spa, and looked to be the form car but it was the pole-sitting No7 of Alex Wurz, Stéphane Sarrazin and Kazuki Nakajima who looked the most likely victor.

The No8 car had been badly damaged during the short-lived but extremely heavy rain that peppered the first two hours of racing. La Pierre lost control on Mulsanne, touching a slower GT car that subsequently took out the No3 Audi. It cost the Toyota eight laps for repairs from which a determined recovery drive would ultimately yield third place. A fine effort but one that for Davidson, who finished second last year and dearly wants to win this title, was a disappointment.

The sister car had no such drama and, although the racing was gripping at the front, had maintained its lead from pole, exchanging it only twice with the No20 Porsche 919 of Mark Webber, Brendon Hartley and Timo Bernhard, who made the right tyre choices during the rain. While the early fast-charge from the sister No14 Porsche was curtailed when it was forced to pit with a fuel flow problem and dropped nine minutes. A gearbox failure shortly before 1pm on Sunday later ended its race.

As night fell and on into the early hours, Nakajima put in quick, flawless stints to draw out a lead. But despite all the new technology their charge was ultimately stymied by the old-school technology of an electrical failure in the loom. The car came to a halt at Arnage and was retired 14 hours into the race. The team will be very disappointed, in this their third year of top-end prototype racing, as they really had the car to do the job.

It was not to be. The waiting Audis were ready to pounce and did so with alacrity, the No2 car taking the lead. Never written off as contenders but behind the eight ball in terms of pace before the start, Audi were coming back.

Then, in a twist of a kind to which the formidably reliable German marque is not entirely accustomed, the leader was forced to pit to change the turbo charger just before 7am. They did so in only 23 minutes and 18 seconds but it handed the lead to the rebuilt sister car, with Kristensen gunning for a remarkable 10th Le Mans victory.

Yet their potential fairytale story was scuppered, too, when lightning struck twice and just after 11am Kristensen, now two laps up on the chasing Porsche, was also forced to pit to change the turbo charger. Despite doing so in an extraordinary 17-minute 36-second stop, Webber’s 919 was now in the lead.

The Australian driver, having never competed in the race itself before, was in a position to take a victory at his first attempt and even more remarkably the possibility was on for Porsche’s own fairytale – that they might just win the big one after a 16-year absence from the top end of the sport.

Webber himself climbed in for the final two and a half hours and, with the chasing No2 car set to catch him within the final hour, a battle to the finish was on the cards for the 263,300 spectators thronging the circuit.

But then, of course, there was one final heartbreaking twist for Porsche, as on lap 345 the 919 slowed and was forced to pit with a powertrain problem that ultimately ended their race. Lotterer took back the lead and 34 laps later Audi once again stood astride the Circuit de La Sarthe, reminding their competitors that for another year they remain but the understudies on endurance racing’s ultimate stage.","Audi’s André Lotterer, Benoît Tréluyer and Marcel Fässler win at Le Mans",http://www.theguardian.com,[Giles Richards],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402854026841/Le-Mans-2014-014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d49b038f389a8540ca1a1f6f76c9d908,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/15/audi-andre-lotterer-benoit-treluyer-marcel-fassler-le-mans
1087,"Avenir Certain, the French 1,000 Guineas winner, completed a Classic double at Chantilly on Sunday when a strong charge down the outside in the home straight carried her a length clear of Amour A Papa in the Prix de Diane, the French Oaks.

Miss France, who took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket, and the unbeaten Shamkala, who started favourite, were also in the field but Miss France found trouble in running at a vital stage while Shamkala, who travelled well, could not find an extra gear in the final quarter-mile. Neither could offer any response as Avenir Certain came with a powerful run under Gregory Benoist to give Jean-Claude Rouget, her trainer, his third success in the Prix de Diane in the past six years.

“We thought she was a bit special, but it was a high-class field,” Rouget said. “Gregory rode her perfectly. I had only given him one bit of advice and that was not to panic, and he didn’t. She seemed quite far back when they came into the final straight, but I could see that she was going well and really relaxed and Gregory got her going at the right moment.”

Zarkava, who finished her career as an unbeaten Arc winner, completed the same Classic double in 2008 but Rouget is unsure whether Avenir Certain will follow a similar path towards Longchamp on the first weekend in October.

“She made me think a little bit of Zarkava,” Rouget said. “Avenir Certain won the Poule d’Essai des Pouliches [French 1,000 Guineas] in soft ground and she won this on good ground, so she is quite straightforward.

“I don’t really want to make a decision about her autumn programme yet. Naturally, every trainer thinks about the Arc but I’m not sure it is the right race for her. I think she might stay but we shall see how things go. Right now, she is going to have a well-deserved break.”

Veda, the runner-up to Avenir Certain in last month’s Classic at Longchamp, could attempt to bounce back from a subsequent defeat in next Friday’s Group One Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Veda was an odds-on chance for the Prix Sandringham at Chantilly earlier this month, but finished sixth of eight starters.

“I won’t say she was disappointing at Chantilly,” George Rimaud, spokesman for the Aga Khan, the filly’s owner, said, “but she didn’t finish her race having been keen early. She is a filly who likes enough pace so she can settle at the back, but unfortunately that didn’t happen in her last race.

“She is by Dansili, so good ground should suit her well. Hopefully, if we decide to go to Ascot, they will go a good pace and then she will be able to travel well and accelerate late in the race.”

1089,"Chris Froome’s build-up to the defence of his Tour de France title suffered a major setback on Sunday with the 2013 Tour winner cracking and sliding out of the top 10 as he attempted to repeat his victory of 2013 in the Criterium du Dauphiné Libéré, while a statement from the governing body, the UCI, helped rebut the implication in the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that his request for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for a corticosteroid earlier this season might have received preferential treatment.

A Team Sky spokesman confirmed that Froome had been “suffering from a chest infection exacerbating his underlying asthma” and had been prescribed prednisolone tablets at 40mg per day by the team doctor during the Tour de Romandie. Froome, who is asthmatic and uses an inhaler occasionally during races, had been forced to pull out of the Liège-Bastogne-Liège classic on 27 April at less than 24 hours notice, due to a chest infection; the TUE was issued on 29 April, the day the Tour de Romandie started.

“At the time I was coming back from a training camp at altitude and I was supposed to participate in Liège-Bastogne-Liège but I was coughing too much and the morning of the race the doctor told me that I had to pull out if I wanted to go to the Tour de Romandie and that I needed to rest for two days,” Froome said, according to L’Equipe.

“I gave everything I had in the Romandie prologue but I was coughing so much that we decided to ask for a TUE that evening. It was just an oral [corticosteroid], there was no injection.”

Prednisolone is a corticosteroid which is widely used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions including arthritis and asthma, with a starting dose if taken in tablet form of between 5 and 60mg per day. In common with other corticosteroids it is on the Wada banned list when taken orally or by injection but its use in competition is permitted if a Therapeutic Use Exemption is applied for.

“In accordance with Wada guidelines the medical team made an application for the use of [prednisolone] through the correct, regulated TUE system. This was granted by the UCI,” said the team. “After the original assessment and decision he was monitored regularly and seen each day by the team doctor to look at his condition and continued racing.”

“Dr Zorzoli, the UCI doctor, told us what we could and couldn’t do, we’ve always stayed within the rules, so we’ve got nothing to hide,” said the team’s head, Sir Dave Brailsford. The newspaper stated that Wada was looking into the issue but, when contacted by the Guardian, the Wada director general, David Howman, said he had no knowledge of this.

A UCI statement said that “nothing out of the ordinary occurred in the case of Chris Froome”. The UCI confirmed that: “Froome’s TUE for oral use of glucocorticosteroids was granted on 29 April, 2014 based on duly documented medical history and in compliance with the applicable UCI regulations and the relevant Wada guidelines. The TUE was granted for a limited period, following the usual procedure.”

The UCI added: “The process was fully transparent as it is UCI’s policy to systematically record all TUEs on ADAMS [a system monitoring the whereabouts of an athlete]. Wada was therefore informed throughout the process.”It rejected the implication that Froome’s application might have received preferential treatment. “The UCI wishes to emphasise that under the applicable rules – which are consistent with the Wada Code and the Wada TUE standard and guidelines – any rider with the same symptoms as Christopher Froome would have received a similar TUE.”

This is not the first time that Sky have been recorded as having applied for a TUE to be issued at short notice; a feature in the magazine Cycle Sport on the team in 2011 noted that their team doctor, Richard Freeman, had to put in a call to Zorzoli to obtain permission for their then rider Rigoberto Urán to use a corticosteroid for a breathing-related problem.

The use of corticosteroids through TUEs in cycling is a vexed one, with some campaigners such as Britain’s David Millar calling for all riders to reveal precisely what TUEs they are using, because their performance-enhancing nature means there is potential for the system to be abused, while others question whether an athlete needing medication should be allowed to compete at all. Defenders of the system point out, however, that it enables cyclists to be treated with prescription medicines in the same way that anyone else might be.

Froome’s challenge in the Dauphiné –the warm-up to the Tour de France, which starts in three weeks – faded on the final day, with the 2013 winner finishing 5min 5sec behind the stage winner, his Team Sky team-mate Mikel Nieve. The overall title went to the young American Andrew Talansky, part of an early escape that dominated the stage and held off a late chase from Spain’s Alberto Contador, the overnight leader after relieving Froome of the yellow jersey on Saturday. In the end the race came down to the two men fighting for every second on the final climb of the race to the stage finish at Courchevel.

By this time, however, Froome was well out of the picture. He confessed afterwards that he was feeling the after-effects of a crash on Friday, revealing that he “was in a lot of pain, my thighs were blocked”, and adding on Twitter, “that crash took its toll on me”.

While the Tour winner eventually finished only 12th overall, the 21-year-old Briton Adam Yates – having participated in the stage-long escape with Talansky and company – finished third on the stage, just 5sec behind Nieve, and ended up sixth overall in his first professional season after riding strongly for the eight days.",Chris Froome’s Dauphiné hopes fade as UCI clears medical remedy,http://www.theguardian.com,[William Fotheringham],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402914601339/d1047e3e-e035-4f26-832a-7b1122618cb7-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=b6a60a4d74407826ebbe74c7c96d80bd,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/15/chris-froome-dauphine-uci
1091,"Grigor Dimitrov, the prince of tennis still waiting for a major crown, was

so relaxed in victory at Queen's on Sunday that he later spoke for the

first time about how Maria Sharapova has helped transform his game in

recent months as he builds towards a a serious assault on Wimbledon.



An hour or so after beating Feliciano López to win his third title of the

year – all on different surfaces – the young Bulgarian could hardly avoid

mention of Sharapova, who was among the adoring throng on a cool and cloudy Sunday afternoon, although they have been circumspect to the point of coyness about the most glamorous relationship in tennis.



However, the combined profile of the handsome young Bulgarian and the

reigning French Open champion is now centre stage. Should they both win Wimbledon ... well, that hardly bears thinking about. The paparazzi are circling - and they might yet be glad of the fixtures clash with the World Cup.



""Having Maria on my side definitely adds up,"" Dimitrov said of the Russian, with whom he has formed a star-dusted partnership for at least 18 months, ""and there is a lot to learn from a tremendous champion like her. She's just been unbelievable with me throughout the year, supporting me. I think the feeling is pretty mutual. I hope that's not going to be the last tournament that she's at.



""It's still completely different in a way, women's tennis and men's tennis, but there is certainly a good amount that I have learned [from her] so far.""



Dimitrov is emerging from his chrysalis with increased urgency at 23, a couple of years older than Roger Federer was when he announced his arrival by winning Wimbledon 11 years ago after a similarly uncertain start to his career.



John McEnroe remarked when Federer made his breakthrough, ""It's nice to be 21; you can change direction so quickly."" He was complimenting the Swiss's court movement. But he might just as easily have been describing the prodigy's progress on the Tour to that point, which had promised more than he had delivered - and that is where Dimitrov finds himself now.



Federer – still playing beautifully at 32 and who earlier on Sunday beat Alejandro Falla in two tight sets to retain his title in Halle - won the first of his 17 majors at his favourite tournament, going on to claim six more at the All England Club. Although it is fanciful to imagine Dimitrov will match those numbers, he plainly has many of the Federer weapons and might do some serious damage when Wimbledon starts next week.



If the weight of the comparison has weighed him down since his arrival as one of the putative leaders of the next generation, he handled the pressure superbly over two-and-a-half hours against the dangerous Spaniard Feliciano Lopez. For the third year in a row, the champion had to come from behind to take the Aegon trophy: 6-7 (8), 7-6 (1), 7-6 (6) over two-and-a-half hours.



After leaving court to the rapturous applause of his worshippers, Dimitrov goes to Wimbledon with his fourth career title (75 behind Federer) and confidence that has grown by the match since he won his first Tour gong last October. That final in Stockholm brought him his 29th win of 2013. Sunday's – on his third different surface of the season – was his 30th victory of 2014. That is impressive acceleration.



Dimitrova also acknowledged the contribution of his latest coach, the Australian Roger Rasheed.



""I always feel comfortable when I have the closest people around me. You feel even more determined because you know that you're embraced either way [win or lose]. It took a little bit of time for me to start to understand what my game is and what I'm looking for - and, in the same time, everything happened pretty naturally with Roger. I really needed a strong person, on and off the court for me. That was something that always kept me on a good way.



""I have Roger all the time next to me, and that gives me confidence. I'm happy that most of the time we're on the same page when it comes to work and practice, so that's a good sign.""



In tennis, as in any sport whose points are sliced into little episodes of uncertainty, it is all about the moment – and Dimitrov took marginally more of the important ones than did Lopez, saving match point to win a tense final.



Earlier, Jamie Murray put forward a heartfelt defence of doubles, after he and the Australian John Peers – the Scot's most consistent partner among 43 since 2006 – took Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares to a champion's tie-break in the final, the Austrian and the Brazilian winning 4-6, 7-6 (4), 10-6 after an hour and 37 minutes of superb close-quarter tennis.



""It's not always the case that the doubles guys get promoted particularly well,"" Murray said. ""I think we bring a lot to the Tour. The level is very high. The money is good. Contrary to other comments (a pointed reference to recent criticism of the game's lesser-regarded art), it is not just a bunch of crap players getting a lucky break with their careers.



""I know how hard we work each week to do the best we can, whether that's in training week or out in a tournament. No one is coasting by and making a decent living. It's not like that at all. I think we deserve a bit more credit than maybe we get.""

1093,"Marc Márquez won a thrilling four-way duel at Sunday’s Catalonia Grand Prix to make it seven victories in as many races as he continued his MotoGP title defence.

1095,"England’s half-back duo of Owen Farrell and Danny Care are facing a race against time to be fit for Saturday’s third and final Test against New Zealand in Hamilton. Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell are also nursing knocks picked up in Saturday’s second Test defeat to the All Blacks, with Bath’s Kyle Eastmond in line to return to a rejigged back division.

Farrell has a knee-ligament problem while Care sustained a blow to his shoulder during the 28-27 loss that enabled New Zealand to take an unbeatable 2-0 series lead. While neither injury is understood to be serious, the head coach Stuart Lancaster has a range of options open to him and is reluctant to pick players who cannot train fully during the week.

It opens up the possibility of a recall for Freddie Burns at fly-half, possibly alongside Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi, whose first Test foray on the wing was not an instant success. Twelvetrees has hurt the same ankle that threatened his availability for the tour, albeit a different part of it, while Burrell has also sustained an ankle strain.

At the end of a long season there is no point flogging half-fit players. “I’ll keep the door open but it does create some selection decisions,” said Lancaster. “The doctor is pretty optimistic on all of them but it’s a question of when they are fit to train. Effectively you’ve only got Tuesday’s training before you announce the team.”

In addition England have Tuesday’s game against the Crusaders to factor in and are also contemplating some tweaks to their forward pack, with Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and Billy Vunipola all starting candidates. Eastmond’s positive display at inside-centre in the first Test already seems likely to count in his favour. “Kyle is definitely in the equation,” said the head coach. “You base a lot on what you see in training and his performance in the first Test also means he is a genuine contender.”

Lancaster, meanwhile, has defended the decision to play Tuilagi on the right wing, insisting it did not cost England the game. “Manu playing on the right wing was certainly not the reason why we went through that period of 20 minutes when the All Blacks increased their intensity and pressure. He was our top carrier and made most metres.

“There were a couple of occasions when the ball was at the back of the lineout with Manu ready to explode off the wing, only for us to drop the ball twice. They’re little things that contribute to the bigger picture. We’ll wait and see how this week goes. He’s certainly a very good option for us at 13 and I don’t think he let anyone down on the wing.”

Collectively, however, Lancaster accepts England need to cut down the unforced errors that helped the All Blacks back into the game. “We gave too much ball away too easily, that’s the bit we need to be better at.

“I don’t think there is a magic wand … for me this tour has always been about who can and who can’t deliver at the highest level under intense pressure.

“The All Blacks have been through this evolution as a team and we’re still on that journey. We still have some decisions to make over the next 12 months as to what our best and most suitable combinations are. We should have been further ahead at half-time … no one is sat here happy because we know we have got to be better. I feel frustrated we’ve not managed to get the win a lot of our players deserved.”",England fret over Owen Farrell and Danny Care for third Test,http://www.theguardian.com,[Robert Kitson],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/6/15/1402831696042/New-Zealand-v-England-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=81f0eb229a7d6c4e92dcbf18718a5075,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/15/stuart-lancaster-owen-farrell-danny-care-new-zealand
1097,"Warren Gatland has turned Wales into a consistent force in Europe since taking over as head coach in 2007 but he has been unable to improve a dismal record against the major southern hemisphere nations in the professional era which stands at two wins and a draw in 53 Tests.

Since beating Australia six years ago in his first crack against a Sanzar side, Gatland’s Wales have lost 23 matches to the Wallabies, New Zealand and South Africa. They have come close to victory on several occasions, but this was their heaviest defeat to the Springboks since their tour here in 2008 and their one salvation was not conceding a point in the final 29 minutes.

“We did not match them physically at times and we did not learn our lessons from the defeat to them in Cardiff last November,” said the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones. “When we had opportunities, we did not take them and while we will bank the positives at the end when we held them out, we have lots to work on, especially in attack.”

Wales were energised when their three backs on the bench, Gareth Davies, James Hook and Matthew Morgan, came on and started to look for gaps rather than bodies. Gatland has kept faith with his scrum-half Mike Phillips over the years but Davies, who had a try ruled out for a forward pass after his break from a line-out on halfway, provided the opportunism that had been so grievously lacking.

“We did not look fit enough,” said Gatland, most of whose players had only had a trial match in the previous six weeks with Wales’s four regions failing to reach the latter stages of any of the tournaments they took part in. “We were very poor in the first half when South Africa dominated the breakdown and won the collisions. We sent some fresh legs on and Gareth looked dangerous, but we paid for a poor first-half performance.”

Another concern for Gatland is Wales’s form on the road. They have lost their last four matches away from Cardiff, starting with a reverse in Japan last summer, and failed to come close to Ireland, England or South Africa who dealt with a blitz defence by chipping into space. The ploy produced two tries for Bryan Habana and Willie Le Roux, who was the game’s outstanding performer.

“Willie is probably the best full-back in the world at the moment,” said the South Africa head coach Heyneke Meyer. “He is playing with a lot of confidence and has a licence to express himself. He started on the wing last season and I challenged him to improve his aerial skills and defence, which he has done.”

Le Roux gave South Africa a decisive advantage behind. Wales had a three-quarter line of Lions Test players while the Springboks had a Test debutant on the wing and a wing in the midfield partnering a 21-year-old making his first international start, but Le Roux gave his side a clinical edge and was involved in four of their five tries.

“We have only ever beaten South Africa once and that is the biggest challenge for us in the second Test on Saturday,” said Gatland. “We have to improve on a few things, be more aggressive and take our chances in attack.” With the World Cup 15 months away, he also has to look at his options and tweak a gameplan that does not inject opponents with doubt.

1099,"The AFL is moving with the times to host footy on Good Friday, although fans may have to wait until 2016 for the historic occasion.

""The AFL commission has today approved for the first time the scheduling of an AFL match on Good Friday,"" commission chairman Mike Fitzpatrick told a news conference on Monday.

""There has been a growing appetite to hold a game on this day and on balance we believe the time is right.

""AFL matches are scheduled on every other public holiday during the season.

""It's now up to the AFL executive to determine whether or not to create a Good Friday fixture and if so when and where.

""Other details as to who might compete in such a game will follow later.""

New AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan acknowledged that the departure of his predecessor Andrew Demetriou had changed the dynamic of the argument, given that Demetriou was an opponent of staging a game on the religious holiday.

But McLachlan said the concept of playing on Good Friday might not be a good fit for the league's fixture in 2015.

""Next year the most likely weekend we would start the season would be that Easter weekend after the Cricket World Cup final and that makes it problematic,"" he said.

""So I don't think it's a given we'll play next year and part of that is the difficulty of finding a match-up.""

North Melbourne and Western Bulldogs have been among those clubs seeking a Good Friday game.

1101,"I really don’t know how I will feel,” Judy Murray says as she tries to imagine her emotions when watching her son begin the defence of his Wimbledon title next week. Andy Murray will enter the tournament with a new coach, Amélie Mauresmo, after a year in which he has had to recover from a back operation while also adjusting to the damaging loss of Ivan Lendl. His former coach, having inspired Murray to two grand slam titles after so many near misses, ended their productive partnership in March.

“I have no idea how Andy’s going to feel either,” his mother says. “It’s another new experience for him. He’s never defended a Wimbledon title so this is strange territory. But Andy loves Wimbledon. He’s had immense pressure but always performed really well. I think he’ll do the same this year.”

Judy Murray has become an increasingly significant presence in British tennis, which includes her role as the captain of the women’s Federation Cup team, but the achievement of last year’s Wimbledon still lingers. “It was such a special and historical moment when Andy won. I just felt huge relief that he’d managed to do it – especially after coming so close the year before. Now, it’s the parent thing, isn’t it? You just want everything to be right for your kids even if you can’t do anything about it.”

It seems striking that her son should have turned to Mauresmo. Just as Judy used creativity and intelligence when coaching Andy, instilling the textured variety in his play that continues today, so Mauresmo displayed the same attributes as a player. She won Wimbledon in 2006 and also coached last year’s winner, Marion Bartoli. “Amélie was a great tactician and she understood and felt the game really well – as Andy does too,” Murray says. “That’s where I see the synergy between them. Obviously everyone will be very interested to see how it works out. But the early signs are good. They’re both enjoying the challenge.”

There have been inevitable jibes about Mauresmo being a woman working in men’s tennis. “I couldn’t do it since I don’t think highly of the women’s game,” the Australian player Marinko Matosevic said last week. “It’s all equal rights these days. Got to be politically correct.”

Andy Murray has responded calmly. When Mauresmo’s name was first mentioned he said: “I don’t really care whether the other male players like it or not. I was coached by my mum for a long time.” He reiterated recently that “I’ve always had a strong female influence in my career. My mum, especially, listened extremely well and that’s something I needed right now.”

Judy Murray hesitates when asked if an ability to listen is one of Mauresmo’s best attributes as a coach? “I don’t know her so well. It’s about Andy working out for himself what he needed. He obviously wanted someone he could talk to and who would listen to him and work on certain aspects of his game. They have lots of similarities so she will understand him very well as a player.

“As she gets to know him as a person it will be a lot easier for her to communicate because it’s a complex process finding the right chemistry. Of course I hope it works well and I really don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t.”

Who first suggested Mauresmo to the Murray camp? “It was Darren Cahill again,” she says of the former Australian player who works as a commentator and a coach for Adidas. Cahill, significantly, also advised Murray to appoint Lendl. “Darren’s one of the greatest coaches in the world,” Judy Murray says, “and he knows Andy very well. So Darren came up with some suggestions – and Amélie was one. I wasn’t really surprised because I saw the similarities in their games.”

Lendl’s influence still runs deep. “He taught Andy and his team so much about preparing for these big events,” she says. “Ivan gave Andy that edge he needed to win the really big ones. But when I first heard he was taking over as Andy’s coach [in December 2011] I must admit I had a different perception of Ivan. Darren’s a wonderful guy and a great teacher – and we initially approached him to become Andy’s coach. But Darren couldn’t do it and he suggested Ivan.

“My knowledge of Ivan was the imposing player who never smiles. I wasn’t sure but you have to trust people who know. Darren said: ‘This really will work because they’ve got so many similarities.’ He was right. They got on like a house on fire and Ivan did an amazing job.”

Murray is a warm and engaging woman – and her work as a coach, to her sons Jamie and Andy and other current professionals, is considerable. She still harbours a passion for tennis, at 54, which has its roots in a truncated playing career. “I would have loved to have given it a go as a player,” she says, “but when I was a junior you played tennis in the summer and badminton in the winter. There were no indoor courts, and the governing body was one man in an office. So winning lots of Scottish titles [Murray won 64 over the course of her long junior and senior career] wasn’t a big deal. When I finished school I went off [on tour] on my own around 1976. I wasn’t tough enough. On the court I was very tough – but off it you’re all by yourself and life is very hard.”

Murray remembers playing Mariana Simionescu, the Romanian who was then Bjorn Borg’s girlfriend, and eventually his first wife. Simionescu reached the fourth round of Wimbledon in 1977, and climbed as high as world No7. “The thing I remember most about her,” Murray says, “was that after the match she wanted to go to the changing room for a cigarette. She couldn’t smoke in front of Borg. I lost in straight sets because she was much better than me. But the experience of wanting to play regularly at that level and not being able to, because there was no real opportunity in my country, was the tough part. Anyway, I didn’t last very long and went to university instead.”

There is a clear sense that Murray felt the urge to coach and succeed in a way that had been denied her as a player. “When I started coaching I volunteered to help the juniors at our local club which was a few hundred metres from our house. That was to keep me playing and get me out the house. The boys were tiny and I enjoyed it. I always felt I’d be a teacher and that’s what I am.

“Some of my kids got quite good and the local boys won the Scottish schools’ championship for Dunblane. Callum Davidson [who still plays football for St Johnstone after stints at Blackburn Rovers and Leicester City] was my reserve. I was so emotional as that was my first success and these kids came from my club, school and town. It was just four boys of roughly the same level and they were a great little unit. Some of the younger kids started to get even better and I thought: ‘Gosh, I need to learn more’, because I’d played with a wooden racket.

“I did some qualifications and when I got the opportunity to be Scottish national coach in 1995 I started on a £25,000 salary with a £90k budget that was meant to cover everyone from the age of seven to the seniors. I had no staff. I just had one indoor centre, with four courts, at Stirling University. There was nothing else. I identified 20 kids between seven and 11 – including Colin Fleming, Jamie Baker, Bally [Elena Baltacha], Jamie and Andy. From that group we’ve got grand slam winners [Jamie Murray also won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon], Olympic gold, Commonwealth gold with Colin, four Davis Cuppers and one Fed Cup player.”

Baltacha’s death last month, from cancer, still hurts Murray. “I knew Bally since she was nine and her first tournament was in the under-10s at my club in Dunblane. As national coach I had lots of involvement in her junior days. But I got to know her particularly well the last three years with the Fed Cup. She was a really fierce competitor – with the heart of a lioness. You saw that fight with all her illnesses which included the liver condition she had from 19 up until her death. She was a real battler – but also kind, funny, humble and appreciative. She was one of my favourite people in the world, without question. That’s why we’re so committed to her Rally for Bally cancer charity.”

The bond Murray feels with all the players from her Scottish development group is obvious. “We only had those four courts and played with six or even eight on a court and made it challenging. I had to learn how to coach. My last qualification took a year and I had files of paperwork. I’m clever so therefore I can write good projects for that kind of qualification. But I was less comfortable translating that information to the kids. How do you teach them bio-mechanics? Eventually I thought: ‘No, I’ll go back and just say turn your shoulders.’

“There was nothing about angular rotation which I didn’t really understand anyway. So it’s about communication. I’m a great believer in developing skills like the drop-shot slice and changing the pace. I like to create thinkers and variety.”

Murray, by now, is beaming and transmitting the verve she had displayed throughout a morning at the Roehampton club when working with a dozen gifted young players brought together by Head. As an ambassador for Head she also remembers how Andy attended a similar masterclass, with Tim Henman, as a teenager.

At an even higher level she expects the GB women’s team to achieve real success – after the different obstacles faced by Heather Watson and Laura Robson have been overcome. “I’ve really enjoyed working on the Fed Cup even if it’s a strange gig in some ways. Obviously the girls have their own coaches and it’s only once or twice a year they come together as a team. But it’s great fun.

“We’ve had some really good wins and been unlucky not to get to the world group. We played Argentina and didn’t have Heather. She had glandular fever and then against Hungary we didn’t have Laura. But we can really do some damage when Laura and Heather reach their peak. Heather’s just about back to where she was before the glandular fever. For Laura, it’s hard because wrist injuries are always tough. But it’s important to look after that wrist for the long term.”

Robson has since confirmed that she will also have to miss the US Open in August. By then, beyond the hope that her son will have staged a stunningly successful defence of his Wimbledon title, Murray hopes to have received planning permission for a new tennis centre in Scotland. “I’d love to have a community centre where I can share everything I’ve learned about the game. This is my last chance and I really want it. We’re applying for planning permission next month and, hopefully, we can produce many more players. I’m determined they’ll have more of an opportunity than I did as a kid. If I do that I would be really proud.”",Judy Murray: I would love to have given it a go as a player,http://www.theguardian.com,[Donald Mcrae],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/6/16/1402915632664/judy-murray-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=42803781ae96d0506627c34cef88691d,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/16/judy-murray-andy-wimbledon-champion
1103,"• German is first player from continental Europe to win US Open • He completes his redemption after period in the wilderness

There were always two tournaments scheduled for Pinehurst No2 this month. Martin Kaymer ensured that number took place on the same weekend.

As this famous old venue prepares to stage the women’s US Open, reflections on the male equivalent should centre around Kaymer’s dominance. If you removed the German from the field, there was a keenly fought contest over the four days here. With Kaymer as part of it this was a procession.

The church bells from Pinehurst’s village chapel played Beethoven’s Ode to Joy as Kaymer stepped towards the 1st tee on Sunday afternoon. That proved an appropriate backdrop; he won by eight, at nine under, following a fourth round of 69.

Kaymer is now a history maker, as the first player from continental Europe to win a US Open. The denouement to this event was not remotely exciting, which serves as a tribute to the imperious 2014 champion.

Kaymer’s golfing redemption is complete. If victory at the Players Championship last month highlighted his long-awaited return to form, a second major success reaffirmed Kaymer’s status as one of the sport’s leading lights. His earlier period in the wilderness was brief in the context of a long professional career.

Kaymer has thereby matched the major haul of his great compatriot, Bernhard Langer, before the age of 30. Langer never finished higher than fourth in a US Open. It was another player in his pomp, however, that Kaymer’s nerveless Sunday Pinehurst was reminiscent of: Tiger Woods.

No sooner had the 29-year-old offered a brief glimpse of fallibility than he slammed shut the door of hope in front of the brow-beaten opposition. At the Players Kaymer secured a wire-to-wire triumph. To do it again in a major championship endorses a special talent, one which previously catapulted Kaymer to the summit of the world rankings.

When Kaymer speaks of working his way back to the summit of this game, such sentiment should not be taken lightly. This is a player who has hit range balls until his hands bled, such is his determination even to flirt with perfection.

Two years after he holed the winning putt at Medinah, Kaymer is virtually certain to return to the Ryder Cup in September. His competitive toughness renders him a significant European weapon.

“If you got him in a Ryder Cup match or coming down the end of a tournament, he’s probably a guy you would rather not face,” said Keegan Bradley, who partnered Kaymer over the first two rounds at Pinehurst. “He’s tough and he’s very, very good.”

Kaymer’s lead had stood at five after 54 holes. Barring a nerve-inflicted disaster, that always looked insurmountable leeway; even a slightly generous Sunday set-up at Pinehurst was not going to trigger scores of 65 or better.

The closest any player got to Kaymer on day four was four strokes, after he bogeyed the 7th. By the time Kaymer holed out for birdie threes at the 13th and 14th, his advantage was eight. To coin World Cup parlance: game over.

Of those making up the numbers Erik Compton’s story was by far the most remarkable. The 34-year-old has undergone two heart transplants and was competing in only his second major championship. His tie for second with Rickie Fowler would be worthy of immense credit, even without the personal battles which the inspirational Compton has endured to get to this point. He has medical permission to use a buggy in competitive rounds but never chooses to do so; to be going toe-to-toe with the best players in world golf, on level terms, is an astonishing feat.

Compton’s story has not been lost on those around him. “It’s incredible, what Erik is doing,” said Rory McIlroy. “By that I mean, just to be playing in a US Open, given everything that Erik has gone through. I have got to know him pretty well over the last few years. And just a really incredible guy, upbeat and obviously very talented. Given everything that Erik has gone through and continues to go through, it’s really phenomenal.”

McIlroy’s US Open ended with a third plus-70 round out of four, this time 73, which left him at six over. A 72 from Phil Mickelson meant he finished one shot worse off than McIlroy and still looking for a kickstart to what has been a low-key season.

“You have got to put it all together to win a major championship,” Mickelson said. “Somebody is going to play well. You can’t get by with scraping it around, you have to have it all firing.

“I thought that I had a great game plan. I was ready to play and sometimes it just doesn’t click. It just doesn’t come together. It’s one thing to have a great game plan, but you have to execute, you got to hit some shots, make some putts, and I threw too many shots away the first two rounds to really have a good chance.”

Being blunt, Mickelson and co were consigned to the territory of the also-ran.

1105,"Seven times Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has left the Grenoble hospital where he has been treated since a skiing accident in the Alps five months ago, his spokeswoman said on Monday.

""Michael has left the CHU Grenoble [hospital] to continue his long phase of rehabilitation. He is not in a coma anymore,"" his manager, Sabine Kehm, said in a statement.

A spokesman for the University Hospital of Lausanne later confirmed Schumacher, who lives with his family in a town in western Switzerland between Lausanne and Geneva, had arrived on Monday morning but declined to say which unit he was being treated in.

The announcement came after a German magazine, Bunte, reported last Friday that the 45-year-old champion had been moved from the Grenoble hospital's intensive care department, where he had been in a medically induced coma, into a rehabilitation unit. The magazine said Schumacher was ""out of danger"", although his chances of a full recovery had diminished. It said preparations were under way to move him to a specialised rehabilitation clinic.

In Germany, the news was greeted euphorically. ""What a great news!!! Get well soon Schumi!!! I'm so glad and happy when I just heard it!"", tweeted Arsenal footballer Lukas Podolski, a few hours before the German team's first World Cup match.

On Saturday, the Germany forward had sent an emotional message to Schumacher from his team's training camp in Brazil, saying he hoped he could watch some of the games and that ""if we get the title, we can bring him some happiness with it"".

The Austrian former Formula One champion Niki Lauda told RTL television he was ""incredibly happy"" for Schumacher: ""I hope for him that he managed to get through rehab as quickly as possible and join us again soon at Formula One.""

Schumacher sustained life-threatening head injuries after falling on to a rock while skiing with friends in the resort of Méribel, in the French Alps, on 29 December. He underwent two operations in Grenoble to remove blood clots on the brain.

Monday's update was the first issued by Kehm since 4 April, when she said Schumacher was making small signs of progress and was showing ""some moments of communication"".

But since then, former Formula One doctor Gary Hartstein wrote on his blog earlier this month that he feared the worst, given the lack of information from Schumacher's family. He said he was ""quite afraid (and virtually certain) we will never have any good news about Michael"".

Kehm thanked the doctors and nurses at Grenoble hospital and the rescue services who took him from the scene of the accident. She said they had done ""an excellent job in those first months"".

She also expressed gratitude for messages of support and asked for privacy while Schumacher's rehabilitation took place.

""The family also wishes to thank all the people who have sent Michael all the many good wishes … We are sure it helped him,"" the statement said. ""For the future we ask for understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye.""

Schumacher has a home on the shores of Lake Geneva. It was reported in March that his wife Corinna had spent £10m on building a medical suite there.","Michael Schumacher out of coma, manager says",http://www.theguardian.com,"[Philip Oltermann, Anne Penketh]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402913329713/Michael-Schumacher-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8d486ad901cdb64e9112b6d3abc1827a,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/16/michael-schumacher-out-of-coma-left-hospital-grenoble
1107,"Mo Farah will double up in the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres at this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow after making a successful return to the track for the first time in 10 months on Sunday night.

Farah was named in an 129-strong England squad, which also includes Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and the exciting 17-year-old Morgan Lake in the heptathlon, as well as the return of the 35-year-old triple jumper Phillips Idowu.

However, there is no place for James Dasaolu, Britain’s fastest 100m sprinter, who ran 9.91 sec last year but is yet to compete since injuring himself in the indoor season – or Chimindu Ujah, who ran 9.96 sec in the Netherlands last week, because his performance came after the squad was selected. Instead Adam Gemili and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey will run for England in the 100m, along with the world indoor 60m champion, Richard Kilty.

Meanwhile, the 400m world champion, Christine Ohuruogu, will miss the individual 400m and concentrate on the 4x400m relay. That is less of a surprise given that Ohuruogu admitted that she wants to take it easier this year to save her energies for the 2015 world championships and 2016 Olympics.

Dasaolu and Ohuruogu are key omissions, but England Athletics team leader Peter Stanley is confident that the team will perform well in Glasgow. “We are delighted to be taking a team to Glasgow that contains a combination of experienced athletes who have medalled at the highest levels of competition and athletes we believe are ready to make their mark,” he said. “Seeing the form already shown this summer by athletes in the squad has been tremendous and I look forward to seeing the athletes seizing the opportunities that the Games will bring.”

Johnson-Thompson said: “It was fantastic to have started the season so well in Götzis and I am now looking ahead to representing Team England. The fact England has a great tradition in the heptathlon at the Commonwealth Games makes me all the more proud to be a part of the Games and determined to continue that success.”

But it is the name of Farah, who ran 53 seconds for the last lap in winning a low-key 5,000m at the Portland Track Festival on Sunday – his first track race since last August’s world championships – which most eyes will focus on. The 31-year-old has won gold medals at Olympics, world and European championships but he is yet to step on a podium at the Commonwealth Games. He finished only ninth in the 5,000m in Melbourne in 2006 and pulled out of the 2010 Games in Delhi citing fatigue, and will want to put that right in Glasgow.

1109,"Any discussion of San Antonio Spurs will focus on age sooner rather than later. So it was on Sunday night, but this time youth, rather than experience, was the topic after Kawhi Leonard was named NBA finals MVP in the wake of the Spurs’ title-clinching victory over Miami Heat.

Leonard, who contributed a team-high 22 points and ten rebounds, shot three of four three-point attempts and made seven of ten field goals. His defence helped restrain LeBron James after he scored 17 points in the first quarter. And he is only 22 years old, making him the same age team-mate Tim Duncan was when he won the accolade in 1999, the year the Spurs lifted the first of their five NBA championship titles.

A star is born, then - with the caveat that in San Antonio, the focus is always on ensuring the constellation shines more brightly than any single entity.

“It just feels like a dream to me,” Leonard said. “This is my second finals appearance in my third year. I’ve been just progressing each year and the team has also. Losing in the semi-finals my first year, and losing the championship my second year, and now winning in my third year, it just makes you believe in your craft and your hard work.”

After mediocre performances in the first two games of this series, the California-born small forward stepped up and made a major impact, helping to shoulder a burden of expectation that mostly weighs on the grizzled trio of Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker.

“It’s like he just played free. You could tell after the first two games, it seemed like his team-mates went to him and said ‘just play basketball’. He not only took what the defense gave him, he took what he wanted at times as well,” said Miami’s Dwyane Wade of Leonard.

Says Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich: “We have conversations throughout the year. They’re mostly one way, because Kawhi’s a really quiet young man. But he listens and he’s a great learner and super competitive, has a drive to be the best that’s really uncommon in our league. He walks the walk. I mean, he is there early; he’s there late. He wants more. He wants me and the coaches to push him.

“So I just talked to him about not being in that deferment, that defer sort of stage. The hell with Tony, the hell with Timmy, the hell with Manu, you play the game. You are the man. You’re part of the engine that makes us go. And it starts with his defence and his rebounding, and he’s starting to feel his oats offensively, obviously, because I have not called a play for him the whole playoff.”

San Antonio’s team-first ethos was exemplified by strong showings from the little-heralded Boris Diaw and Patty Mills, while their collective determination was evident in the way they recovered from a dismal first quarter to dismantle the reigning champions for the third contest in succession.

“Why that happened is because the guys have character. They play the game the way we ask them to play it. They don’t get too excited if they’re doing well, and they don’t get too down if things are going badly. They just try to execute,” said Popovich.

“Last year’s loss was devastating. I’ve said many times, a day didn’t go by where I didn’t think about game six. So I think just in general, for the group to have the fortitude that they showed to get back to this spot, I think speaks volumes about how they’re constituted and what kind of fibre they have.”

It was clear that San Antonio were galvanised by the traumatic nature of their loss to Miami in 2013 - as well as aided by flaccid efforts from Miami's supporting cast, which made the Heat over-reliant on James.

“What happened last year definitely helped our drive and to stay focused for an extended period of time,” Duncan said. “It very easily could have hit us in different ways and we could have reacted in different ways. But we reacted the right way. We got great leadership from the top in Pop who came back absolutely fired up and ready to go, and to push us this far and this hard and to come out with the championship is amazing.”

After his side failed to win their third title in four years, Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra acknowledged that the better team won - 104-87 on the night and 4-1 overall in the best-of-seven series.

“You absolutely have to tip your hat to that team. They played exquisite basketball this series and in particular these last three games, and they are the better team. There’s no other way to say it. They played great basketball and we couldn’t respond to it,” he said.

“Even as painful as it feels right now, you have to have perspective. Even the team we’re playing against has never been to the finals four straight years. You can’t be jaded enough not to appreciate that.”

James, who has an opt-out clause in his contract, swatted away questions about his future in the post-game press conference and preferred to pay homage to Miami’s conquerors.

“They were the much better team,” he said. “That’s how team basketball should be played. You know, it’s selfless. Guys move, cut, pass, you’ve got a shot, you take it, but it’s all for the team and it’s never about the individual. That’s the brand of basketball and that’s how team basketball should be played.”",NBA finals MVP Kawhi Leonard shows future is bright for San Antonio Spurs,http://www.theguardian.com,[Tom Dart],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402899136032/37a9eb77-2027-4e42-be69-a5fdfe694a6e-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=831ee38a2ea7f1a3b7867c9571127aab,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/16/nba-finals-mvp-kawhi-leonard-shows-future-is-bright-for-san-antonio-spurs

He will be sidelined for around six weeks and is likely to be replaced in New Zealand’s midfield in Hamilton by Malakai Fekitoa, who won his first cap as a replacement the first Test.

Bath’s Kyle Eastmond, meanwhile, is set to feature in England’s Test plans after being omitted from the midweek side who play the Crusaders on Tuesday. Brad Barritt and Henry Trinder will fill the centre positions with Danny Cipriani chosen at fly-half ahead of Stephen Myler. Leicester’s Ed Slater will captain the side with the former Crusaders lock Michael Paterson, now of Sale, on the bench – England’s forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, said the tour party were looking upon the fixture as effectively “a fourth Test” despite the weakened nature of the Crusaders team. “We’ve spoken about this game for a long time. It’s a huge occasion for the lads to show us what they can do. We’re looking forward to it immensely.”

The England players will be wearing a logo on their jerseys in support of the Canterbury Rugby Earthquake Relief Charitable Trust.

1113,"San Antonio Spurs cauterised the wounds of twelve months ago by claiming their first NBA championship since 2007 with a crushing win over Miami Heat.

It was elegance with a serrated edge, as the Spurs recovered from a slapdash start to win 104-87 in a clinical, yet feverish, display that underlined their superiority and dethroned the reigning NBA champions, denying Miami their third title in three years.

What was shaping a week ago to be the second successive, evenly balanced and see-saw NBA finals between these teams instead proved shockingly one-sided, as Miami were squelched for the third time in six days and lost the best-of-seven series by four games to one.

How quickly the storyline has mutated from talk of a Heat 'three-peat' to now-inevitable questions about whether this defeat marks the end of an era. Miami’s Big Three, LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade, all have contract opt-out clauses and could leave, remote as the possibility seems.

After Miami levelled the series at 1-1 following a close game here seven days prior, San Antonio eviscerated them twice in south Florida, producing purple patches to expose the Heat’s defensive black holes.

The Texans won the third game by 19 points then shot 57% from the field in game four, a 107-86 victory in AmericanAirlines Arena. The numbers were less gaudy in this contest, though they hit 46% of their three-point attempts, with Australian Patty Mills five-for-eight.

Ahead of the tip-off a fan outside the arena held a placard reading “Le team versus LeBron”. It was a fair enough summary of the series, with the Spurs’ passing game stunningly effective, above all in games three and four, orchestrated by the predictably excellent Tony Parker and aided by the less-heralded craft of his fellow Frenchman, Boris Diaw.

James received meagre support from most of his team-mates throughout this series: Miami’s bench players were virtual ciphers, with Mario Chalmers especially poor and the side clearly missing the veteran influence of Mike Miller, who left after last year’s finals.

Still, any analysis of what went wrong for Miami ought to be prefaced by an assessment of what went right for the Spurs: pretty much everything. Evidently fuelled by the agony of losing a series twelve months ago when the trophy was almost within their grasp, they also had the teamwork, technique and experience to turn their quest for revenge into a reality.

This is the Spurs' fifth NBA championship in franchise history, all won since 1999; a record that, if they had more glamorous players and were in a higher-profile city, would earn them more regular comparisons with great American champions in various sports from recent generations such as the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Lakers and New England Patriots.

San Antonio were less than 30 seconds from winning the 2013 series in game six. Miami required an equally dramatic, though longer-term turnaround this year, since no side has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals.

Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra shook up his starting line-up, giving Ray Allen the start ahead of Chalmers. It seemed an inspired move, as the home side endured a dire few opening minutes, fallling 6-0 down with 3 minutes and 19 seconds gone and prompting Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich to call a time-out.

It got worse, with the Heat up 19-5 midway through the first quarter. With Kawhi Leonard impressive once again and providing a couple of three-pointers, the Spurs reduced the deficit to seven points at the end of the quarter. James had 17 of Miami’s 29 points, ultimately top-scoring with 31. But as in previous games, it was apparent that once the Spurs shifted into higher gears, the Heat did not have the power to keep pace.

The Spurs were missing simple shots but insidiously squirmed their way back into the game, with James returning to Earth and Leonard in fine shooting form. The 22-year-old's third three-pointer of the night put San Antonio two points to the good with less than five minutes remaining in the half and prompted an eardrum-busting, sustained bellow of delight from the crowd. Everything’s bigger in Texas, including the decibel counts.

James scored only three points in that quarter and the Spurs brought a seven-point advantage into the second half. James had scored 20 points - half his team’s total.

The situation became even more grave for the visitors in the third quarter, as San Antonio opened up a 59-42 lead with 6 minutes left and the celebrations when shots were sunk started to look as exuberant on the court as they were in the stands.

Three three-pointers in short order, two from Mills and another from Manu Ginobili, put the Spurs 21 points up and a scoreline reading 77-58 entering the final quarter looked to have insulated them from the possibility of any echo of last year’s late, late heartbreak.

The Heat offered some token resistance, pulling back to within 14 points with about ten minutes to go. But this was to be San Antonio’s night, San Antonio’s series, and after that devastating third quarter, everyone knew it. The only question left was who would be the series MVP. It was answered moments after the ticker-tape fell from the roof and the gleaming trophy was raised aloft, when Leonard’s name was announced and the crowd had yet another reason to go wild.",San Antonio Spurs beat Miami Heat in finals series to win NBA championship,http://www.theguardian.com,[Tom Dart],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402890552426/c831f12f-e177-4a88-a291-0b44fd6f90b9-1020x612.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=aba9a049ca4badc62b588aebe2d7c9a6,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/16/san-antonio-spurs-beat-miami-heat-4-1-in-finals-series-to-win-nba-championship
1115,"Ball One: Bowlers raise Somerset to the summit at the halfway mark

The County Championship season reached its midpoint with Somerset elbowing their way to the head of the three counties that have crossed the 100-points mark. Alfonso Thomas’s four wickets in four balls caught the headlines in a low-scoring affair at Taunton, but the match turned when Craig Overton walked to the crease after Craig Kieswetter’s counter-attacking 65 had raised Somerset to a (still perilous) 125-7. Overton, still just 20 years old, found handy partners in Craig Meschede and Thomas, as Somerset’s three No8s (though they batted at eight, nine and 10) turned an 89-run deficit into a 75-run advantage by the time they pulled on their bowling boots for the day job. Sussex had lost half their wickets before they were in credit again and their late order couldn’t repeat their opponents’ batting heroics. That’s a second consecutive home win for Marcus Trescothick’s men, who are turning the familiar high-scoring home draws of the past into more valuable low scoring wins.

Ball Two: Consistent James Taylor reminds us of his potential

There just wasn’t quite enough time left in a weather-affected match for Yorkshire or Nottinghamshire to force a win at Headingley. The visitors, just outside the top three, fielded nine players with international experience, with James Taylor’s four-and-a-half-hour 96 the pick of their performances. The diminutive batsman has not added to his famous double century collection this season; indeed, he is yet to score a ton, but in six out of the seven matches in which he has batted, he has contributed an innings of at least 60 – consistency itself. Still only 24 years old, his two Tests (against an attack featuring Steyn, Morkel, Philander and Kallis) are fading into the distance – the last two years have been particularly long ones for Team England. But Taylor is still a young man and it’s too soon to be writing off his chances of further international honours.

Ball Three: Simon Kerrigan keeps on bowling and taking wickets



Lancashire had carefully constructed a position from which they could have forced a much needed second win of the season, but time lost and both sides’ inability to score at above 2.7-runs per over in their first innings consigned the match to a draw. Simon Kerrigan got through 50 overs across the two Warwickshire innings for his three wickets, giving him 220 overs in the Championship this season for his 18 wickets. He is much the most successful England qualified spinner in the top flight in the first half of the campaign, but I’m afraid that isn’t saying much.

Ball Four: David Wainwright represents traditional county cricket

The only positive result in Division Two saw Derbyshire and Leicestershire swap places in the basement, with Wayne Madsen owing much to his all-rounder David Wainwright, who delivered the rare match combination of a century and a five-fer to lift Derbyshire to eighth in the table. Wainwright travelled the short distance south from Yorkshire when it became clear he wasn’t quite good enough to hold down a slot with bat or ball in Division One, particularly with Adil Rashid unwanted by England and a palpably better player. Nevertheless, as this match proves, he remains a favourite of mine, as he usually finds a way to contribute and is the kind of player that makes the domestic summer what it is (and, despite everything, what it has been for generations). Long may him, and his ilk, survive.

Ball Five: Cockbain and Smith fight on and on and on

If Wainwright personifies the remarkably unremarkable nature of much that sustains the county cricket fan, Surrey’s match at Bristol was drawn from the other end of the spectrum. Gloucestershire looked utterly doomed after the Londoners’ batsmen at last found form to post 626-6dec, asking the home team to bat two whole days for a draw. Incredibly, they did. The hitherto unheralded Ian Cockbain played the innings of his life, batting for nearly nine hours as he resisted everything thrown at him for 146 overs of formidable concentration. He was supported magnificently by so-called nightwatchman Tom Smith, whose career-best 80 stretched almost to tea. It’s sometimes said that journeyman pros don’t always give their all in low-profile matches as the treadmill turns swiftly, burying a defeat with another bright new dawn and the toss of a coin. The two Gloucestershire boys clearly didn’t get the memo.

Ball Six: Darren Stevens puts on a show but goes unrewarded

You don’t always get what you deserve in life, a lesson Darren Stevens must reflect upon when he looks at some of the players who have played white-ball cricket for England during his 17 years as a grizzled pro (for he was surely a grizzled even when starting out at 21). He’s 38 now and very grizzled indeed, but he can still do it, as he showed in the T20 Blast at Cardiff. Having opened the bowling, yielding just 22 runs from his four overs and snaring Glamorgan’s three most dangerous batsmen (Jacques Rudolph, Jim Allenby and, possibly the only man left on the circuit capable out-grizzling him, Murray Goodwin), he then biffed 71 off 39 balls. And he still didn’t get the win! A tie was his reward after royally entertaining the crowd. Given his career, one that never quite got what it deserved, that seems somehow fitting.

And, barring certain rights restrictions, thanks to video-sharing sites it has never been easier to (re)discover great/awful/random sporting stories from history. But what to do when a brilliant one that you are yearning for isn't there?

Here are just three that I've yet to stumble across, yet would dearly enjoy to be uploaded: AS Adema's hard-fought 149-0 win against Stade Olympique L'Emyrne, the Battle of Goodison Park, and any recorded instance of a condor in golf. There are many more.

Perhaps I am simply looking in the wrong places. Perhaps someone recalls seeing one of the aforementioned clips somewhere else. Perhaps someone has said video in their possession. Or perhaps said moment wasn't captured or simply doesn't exist on film. Either way, the plan for this blog is to attempt to uncover any videos that our readers would appreciate being uploaded.

A brief poll on Twitter produced the following pleas:

So, if you have happened upon any of these, or possess video that could be potentially uploaded online that would make a reader's day, then please do so. And if there are any clips from down the years that you would love to see, then post your requests below the line; one of our readers may be able to assist. (And as a particularly sad individual, if someone has video of Plymouth beating Darlington at Wembley in 1996 that they could upload, I would be forever in their debt).",Classic YouTube: lost and found,http://www.theguardian.com,[James Dart],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2012/1/31/1328031441373/Its-time-to-hunt-around-t-007.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=765c1fe707987d68affbe61f5ef701e2,2012-02-01 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/01/classic-youtube-lost-and-found

Rob Fielder does not hold back in this feature for In Bed With Maradona. He lays his cards on the table in the first paragraph and grabs his readers from the start: ""In many regards the 1954 World Cup can be looked back on as the greatest ever. It was the first time that matches were shown live on television, it boasted more goals per game than any other edition in history, and it had a final that was truly memorable with a late twist in the tale. Yet even in that tournament, a World Cup finals which saw a match between Austria and Switzerland finish 7-5 after the Swiss had led 3-0; there was one encounter which stood out. When Hungary met Uruguay in Lausanne, it was a match-up which embodied everything the World Cup was created for. The world champions took on the Olympic champions in a game which had none of the animosity that had soured some of the earliest clashes."" If that doesn't whet your appetite, nothing will.

This feature by Martin Fitzgerald in the Anfield Wrap is not a normal piece of football writing. It begins: ""I'd like to introduce you to someone. His name is Ebi and he’s from Iran. Ebi was born in Tehran in 1980, a year after the National Revolution and just two weeks before Iran got caught up in a war with Iraq that would last the next eight years.

Ken Early of the Irish Times looks back on those heady days in the summer of 2004 when England fans thought they had discovered the White Pelé and that their new golden boy would go on to eclipse his future club-mate, Cristiano Ronaldo, and bring his county some overdue success. It hasn't really turned out like that for Wayne Rooney. He was scrappy at Euro 2004. He was impetuous; he lost the ball; his touch was heavy and he could have been sent off every time he flew into a tackle. But he made the hearts of grown men sing. And he doesn't do that very often these days. Neither do England. Maybe 2004 was a high point for this generation after all.

1123,"Parramatta continue to surprise

In a game in which both teams’ backlines were ransacked by Origin, Sunday’s clash between Canterbury and Parramatta was all about who could best adjust to their respective loss of personnel. Perhaps surprisingly it was Parramatta who coped best on this front because history shows they get the vapours whenever Jarryd Hayne is unavailable (and to be fair, their record in this regard was, before Sunday, a lamentable four wins from 29 without him). But with Hayne in Origin camp – along with Will Hopoate – Brad Arthur took a gamble by shifting the in-form Chris Sandow from half to fullback. He then brought Luke Kelly into the No7 alongside five-eighth Corey Norman. And it worked. Although his goal-kicking let him down in the Eels' 22-12 victory, Sandow was just as influential, showing how fullbacks these days are effectively a third half (if that makes sense), while up front, despite the tireless efforts of James Graham for the Dogs, key performances were put in by Tim Mannah, Kenny Edwards and, in particular, Pauli Pauli, who had two try assists. He's a keeper, that one.

That said, in a game in which there was no great discrepancy in the stats, the Dogs’ biggest problem was a lack of coherence – understandable considering they were missing both halves, Trent Hodkinson and Josh Reynolds (along with Josh Morris and forward Aidan Tolman), and had hooker Michael Ennis playing halfback with second-rower Josh Jackson playing five-eighth. It’s like the Bulldogs are paying the price for their brilliant start to the season and now Des Hasler’s team are winless in three and experiencing their first real hiccup this season.

Souths’ English brothers keep home fires burning



With Greg Inglis, Chris McQueen and Ben Te’o away to fight on another front (the Origin front, that is), and with Joel Reddy and Bryson Goodwin laid up in the infirmary, South Sydney rallied those left behind. And together they held off the Tigers – overpowered them, in truth – for their fourth win in succession. After an unconvincing start to the season Souths are beginning to resemble the team that rolled impressively into last year’s preliminary finals. To that end, it’s no coincidence that John Sutton and Adam Reynolds are finding form.

Souths’ 32-10 win on Friday night, however, owed much to the quick feet of youngsters Alex Johnston and Kyle Turner, both of whom scored doubles. But the win was constructed on forward metres and quick play the balls, not least those accumulated by the Burgess brothers, all four of them, playing together for the first time this year. With Sam leading the way, he, George, Tom and Luke contributed a combined 60 hit-ups, 495m and 87 tackles. Not since the Krays has one family ridden so roughshod.

As we see so often, it hobbles a team to have to play without its Origin stars, so to have in your arsenal a cadre of key performers with no chance of getting selected for Origin, well it’s no accident of recruitment. And it’s a real benefit in maximising your chances of victory through the long Origin-affected period.

There is such a thing as a good loss, isn’t there?

Considering what a miserable year it’s been for St George Illawarra – apart from the three straight wins to start the season (after which the Dragons took off their Tom Cruise mask to reveal Steve Buscemi underneath) – one is forced to look for upsides to downsides. As such, while they lost their fifth game in six matches on Saturday night, the Dragons did so without rolling over and having their bellies scratched. Interim coach Paul McGregor – overseeing the team for just the third time since the sacking of Steve Price in late May – declared himself pleased with the effort, and he had every reason to be. Playing the competition-leading Panthers on their own turf, and doing so without Trent Merrin, Josh Dugan and Brett Morris, the Dragons looked a unified bunch, and they held their own in almost all the relevant stats. They completed 82% of their sets (compared to Penrith’s 69%), they made one more line break than the Panthers, missed two fewer tackles, and made four fewer errors. The difference was not attitude and weak defending, as it’s been all year, but rather the poor goal-kicking of Gareth Widdop who landed one from three (compared to Jamie Soward’s three from three), and some poor options taken in good attacking positions. While he’s starting to show signs that he’s getting up to speed after his convalescence in, and after, Super Rugby, Benji Marshall pulled out a few errors at just the wrong time. But if his rate of improvement continues, and the Dragons can recapture this kind of pride and spirit, they may yet salvage something from 2014.

Delicate constitutions aren’t spared in the NRL

Anyone who follows the Premier League has seen the comical pantomime that goes on when a player scores a goal against his old club. Instead of doing the robot dance or beating his chest like a silverback gorilla who’s just gone and solved a Rubik’s Cube given to him by Jane Goodall, the scorer adopts an apologetic, almost despairing, mien as if to say to the fans who once adored him, ‘This pains me as much as it does you.” Of course it’s nonsense. The fans know it, the player knows it, but the charade plays out anyway, supposedly as a sign of respect (although more likely it’s about avoiding anything that might incite those fans of little circumspection who might take a celebration as some kind of personal insult and so put rock through the rear window of your Maserati).

Anyway, that all came to mind of Saturday night when Soward took on his old team St George Illawarra. Pleasingly, he chose to wear his heart on his sleeve and we were subjected to a gamut of smiles, fist-pumps and euphoric leaps as he helped the Panthers to three tries and a hard fought win. One can only hope no Dragons fans were offended by his display of pleasure, which seemed genuine and not at all intended to rub salt into any wounds. If they were they may need to seek out a more rounded life.

What happens on the field no longer stays there

Remember the old adage stating, “What happens on the field stays on the field”? Like in the good ol’ days when you could cheekily bite a chunk out of someone’s ear and expect them to cop it sweet afterwards and not rat on you because the ref missed it? As if bringing it to the world’s attention was somehow more underhanded than delivering the bite? Well, the saying was, in my eyes at least, the last refuge of the scoundrel, though I’m not sure it was all that successful in keeping the aggrieved quiet. Even so, the spirit of the adage seems to be ignored in a wholesale way these days, and, as such, after being rolled by the Roosters on Saturday night, Newcastle were not shy to complain about Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, who they claimed deliberately targets tacklers with his elbows – which can be found on the end of some meaty forearms.

Twice in the game, Newcastle skipper Kurt Gidley complained, the Kiwi front-rower led with his elbow. First he caught David Fa'alogo across the neck, then Jeremy Smith got the same treatment – which led to him leaving the field. Waerea-Hargreaves, you may recall, laid out Danny Buderus in similar fashion in last year’s preliminary final… so there’s history. Newcastle coach Wayne Bennett chimed in with his thoughts, saying the NRL needed to take action. “A good example is the Jeremy Smith one, if that's acceptable in the game then the game has to change enormously,"" he said. ""We all saw it, the video ref saw it, and they all obviously said that was acceptable. Anyone who knows rugby league knows that is not acceptable so we'll see what the future brings.""

1125,"Buddy blows settle heavyweight bout

Sydneysiders and friends flocked to the SCG – 41,317 of them, the fourth-biggest crowd ever at the venue for a Swans game – for the top-of-the-table clash against Port Adelaide, and the protagonists didn’t disappoint. This was no flogging, as Sydney handed out to Geelong two weeks ago, but the four-point verdict was no less satisfying against the ladder-leading Power, who had set the competition alight with eight straight wins. It was an arm wrestle that really could have gone either way, and, as is often the case in closely fought affairs, it required a touch or two of individual brilliance to separate the sides. Lance Franklin booted the last five Swans goals, including a long bomb and a highlights reel special from the boundary line, and is fast becoming the talisman Sydney officials who signed him hoped he would be. Franklin helped offset the loss of Kurt Tippett, engineering a key triumph in the context of the season. Port were brave and lost no caste in defeat but their lead at the summit is now reduced to one game, while the Swans head into Friday’s game against Richmond at the MCG undefeated in eight matches. They also do it as firm Premiership favourites.

A Giant step for GWS

Expansion clubs go through many a horrid experience in their formative years, but as they mature boxes get ticked along the way. Greater Western Sydney ticked a pretty big one on Saturday night at the Gabba when they recorded their first away win, a rousing 45-point defeat of a wounded Brisbane Lions outfit. The Lions are nobody’s idea of a yardstick (except, sadly this season for them, for mediocrity), but the Giants delivered with a performance they’d been promising for some weeks. Losing Jonathan Brown to a nasty head knock early in the third quarter no doubt worked in their favour, as did Daniel Merrett’s pre-match withdrawal, but it’s hard to envisage a different result to this game given GWS’s dominant second half. In addition to their first win on the road, the Giants also registered their greatest winning margin, their highest score (125 points) and their first victory over Brisbane. They’re growing up before our eyes and will relinquish the wooden spoon this year (another box ticked), with the struggling Lions a serious contender to pick it up.

Glass half empty for West Coast … and Suns

The competition’s other start-up, Gold Coast, are also going the right way this year. Their form in the first half of the season has been admirable, but in three weeks (for three losses) they’ve gone from near certainties for the finals to staring into the abyss of the bottom eight. To their credit they gave the Eagles an almighty fright by overcoming a 35-point deficit at three-quarter time before narrowly going down, but no points are awarded for honourable defeats. The Suns’ run home is kind enough, but they’ll want something from their next three weeks – against Geelong, Hawthorn and Collingwood – to avoid disappearing from sight. For West Coast, this at least arrested a three-game losing run. But for a team thought of as knockout flag hopes at season’s start, their campaign remains stuck in second gear. There was a lot to like about the performance of Nic Naitanui in his 100th outing but injuries have taken their toll and the Eagles just can’t get their best 22 together. Against the Suns, Dean Cox, Scott Selwood and Luke Shuey were either injured or missed the game altogether. If they are to make a charge for the top eight they’ll do it without Darren Glass, their fearless captain who retired during the week. He mightn’t have been the most skilled player, as the man himself concedes, but there are few who stood taller in a contest than Glass. The competition’s key forwards will sleep easier for his absence.

One fewer contender for the top four

It’s a moot point whether Collingwood were ever a realistic chance for a top-four finish – or, for that matter, even looked like a top-four side in 2014 – but after going down to lowly Western Bulldogs on Sunday, the Magpies can safely be ruled out of the reckoning for the double chance. Mathematically, of course, they’re still in with a shout, but on all known evidence the Pies fall some way short of the standard set by Port Adelaide, Sydney and Hawthorn – even Fremantle and Geelong, the two teams destined to duel for fourth spot. This is the second time in five outings Collingwood have succumbed to a bottom-eight side – the Crows in Adelaide being the other – and they were arguably fortunate to come away with a narrow win over West Coast at the MCG in late May. It’s not the sort of form coach Nathan Buckley wants to be taking into the run home. The Magpies will still play finals footy, but they’ll need to find another gear from somewhere to ensure they aren’t September also-rans.

Just don’t mention Asada

The best – in terms of sheer drama – was saved for last on the weekend in the unlikely shape of Essendon versus Melbourne at the MCG. Sure, Swans-Power was a heart-stopping belter – but we expected nothing less. On Sunday, however, the Bombers and Demons left pre-match billing for dead with a contest that electrified one set of fans and destroyed the other, but enthralled all who witnessed it. Melbourne, so thoroughly outplayed in the first half but kept in it by inaccurate kicking from their opponents, slipped the noose here to win by a point; Paul Roos isn’t given to hyperbole, so take it as read when he says the Dees could have gone down by 70-80 points. Their progress under Roos continues to impress, but Essendon fell back to the pack by letting this one go. Typically, Mark Thompson refused to blame the show-cause letters handed to his players by Asada for the loss. But how can this long-running saga, a dark cloud that follows the club everywhere, not be playing on the minds of his men?

1127,"12.30pm Hannon happy with Toronado ahead of Queen Anne

Tony Paley: Richard Hannon has declared Toronado will be his best chance of a Royal Ascot winner this week in the Queen Anne Stakes on Tuesday as he readies his team for the meeting as a trainer in his own right. for the first time.

Toronado has not run since he disappointed on in the Juddmonte International at York last August but confidence is very high in the Hannon camp.

“Like my dad, all I ever ask for is at least one winner at Royal Ascot, and I suppose our best chance comes in the very first race, with Toronado in the Queen Anne Stakes,” said Hannon, who assisted his father when Paco Boy and Canford Cliffs won this race twice in three years for the yard.

“This has always been Toronado’s first target, and his preparation could not have gone better. He’s in great nick and we’ve been very happy with him going in. His work has been good. He will improve for it, but I’d be disappointed if he didn’t win.

“He won the Craven first time out last year, so we don’t see lack of a prep-race being a problem, and we were all very impressed when we went a mile on the grass up at Everleigh last week, looking every inch the horse we think he is.

“However, now he has to go and do it on the track again - fingers crossed he’ll come through the test with flying colours.

“It’s the best meeting of the year, no doubt there are some great horses running, but hopefully a few of our big guns can win early on in the week.”

Hannon also runs Producer, ridden by Ryan Moore, and he added on http://www.richardhannonracing.co.uk: “We also run Producer here rather than having him hump a big weight in the Royal Hunt Cup. He has not run since winning a Group Two in Turkey last year, but he is very well and with place money down to sixth, who knows.”

Chief market rival for Toronado is Aidan O’Brien’s American import Verrazano, third in the Lockinge at Newbury behind Hannon’s Olympic Glory on his European debut which was his first run on grass.

Joseph O’Brien, who will be riding for his father, told At The Races: “He’s done well since the Lockinge, we feel he’s come on since the race. We feel he’ll like Ascot, it’s going to be his second run on grass, he should have learned plenty from Newbury so we’re looking forward to it.

“The ground wasn’t too bad at Newbury, but the faster the better. He’s a very uncomplicated horse, he ran a lovely race at Newbury and we’re looking forward to it.”

Monday’s best bets, by Greg Wood

It is a little more than a year since Secret Gesture won the Lingfield Oaks Trial by 10 lengths, thereby ensuring that she would start at a short price for the Oaks itself. Even if the Epsom Classic proved beyond her - which it did, but only just - it seemed unthinkable that more success at a much higher level would be long delayed.

Twenty-four hours before the start of Royal Ascot 2014, however, that remains the last victory on Secret Gesture’s record, and she will not be heading to Berkshire this week either. Instead, she will line up for the Warwickshire Oaks at Nottingham this evening, and while it is not quite the Last Chance Saloon, defeat in this Listed contest would draw further attention to her habit of always finding something to beat her.

Secret Gesture (7.50) will not find a better opportunity than this to get back into the winner’s enclosure, however, and a price of around 5-4 looks perfectly fair.

Lady Horatia (6.50) is also worth an interest at the same meeting. Her good third behind Kickboxer last time out was boosted when the winner went on to make the frame in a Class Two contest at York and she could get a soft lead.

Italian Tom (7.35) and Black Dave (8.05) are the pick of the prices at Windsor this evening, while on a couple of uninspiring afternoon cards, Jacquotte Delahaye (4.15) and Engai (4.00) make most appeal at Carlisle and Newton Abbot respectively.

Royal Ascot tipping competition - starts tomorrow!

Congratulations to Ellandback, who seized last week’s competition in the dying strides by picking Chain Of Events (6-1) to finish on +24. That was too bad for Copshaw, who held the lead for much of the week but whose winner-finding ability deserted him when it mattered most.

This week, as usual for Ascot week, we’ll be running a separate competition on each day. You’ll be asked to pick a horse in each race at Ascot on that particular day and whoever does best will win a £50 bet from those generous folk at Ladbrokes! So, that’s four chances to win a prize. How can you miss?

For today, do please let us know what you’re backing in the hope of building up funds for the greatest Flat meeting and then join us back here tomorrow, when the fun will really begin.

1141,"Connecticut photographer Jim Barber never fretted about where his kids’ toys came from until a 2009 news alert reported record lead levels in the toys of three of the nation’s major toy makers. As Barber joined other concerned parents in removing offending products from their collections, he was shocked to find out how many came from China. “Most had to be thrown away,” he recalls.



This very concern later inspired Barber’s business, Luke’s Toy Factory, a startup making eco-friendly, sustainable and safe toys from recycled, organic materials. Barber and his now adult son, Luke, who designs the toys, use an organic wood composite using sawdust, rice holes and wheat straw— waste materials outside the food stream, and combine this with plastic. “The toys then feel and act like wood—durable and attractive, and yet contain 40% less plastic than conventional toys,” Barber explains.

The company has full funding and is currently on Kickstarter.com, the crowd-funding platform to gain preorders for the first toy—a fire truck designed with five interlocking parts. Subsequent products such as dump trucks, flat beds and tanker trucks will connect with the first toy’s base frame, Barber says. Already orders are strong, in part because the price ($19.95 per truck) compares with mass produced toys, and everything is US made—an important component to their big picture business goal, Barber says. Domestic production ensures all aspects of creating the toys can be carefully monitored for safety. Eliminating shipping from China allows a shorter time to market and a leaner inventory.

In practice this means Luke’s Toy Factory is located in Danbury, Connecticut, with its factory is in Southington, Connecticut. All materials come from Michigan and Kansas and the tooling from a tool shop in Massachusetts. “We want to help keep jobs in the states and show other US-based entrepreneurs there is no reason why we can’t make our toys here,” Barber says.

A waste-to-toys effort

Luke’s Toy Factory is part of a larger waste-to-toys effort within the toy industry to make high quality, eco-friendly products from recyclable, organic materials, all domestically, within the states. The largest and first player in the US market, Green Toys Inc, makes toys from recycled plastic milk bottles devoid of BPA, PVC or phthalates.

President Robert von Goeben says the company started small in 2007, literally out of their San Francisco garage - it now exports to over 90 countries and sells in retailers including Whole Foods and Pottery Barn.

This year, Green Toys Inc entered South Korea, a huge market. What’s pushing sales, he says, is the growing trend of parents looking at toys as they do food. Consumers question the impact on their health and environment of many products, including toys. Quality toys of recyclable materials appeal to consumers’ memories of old-fashioned imaginative toys and a desire for kids to have a grounded childhood. “That’s our sweet spot,” he says.

Von Goeben sees his company's competition as more than just other companies using recycled plastic. “Most of the wooden toys companies like Melissa and Doug are our competition. We must make it as good as theirs and quantifiably green.” Like Barber, von Goeben views US-made as essential to their business model. He views US-made goods as the world’s highest quality goods and in toys, quality really matters. “Our customers trust us when they bring our products into their home. It’s a big responsibility we don’t take lightly.”

How big a business?

Experts wonder, however, whether the sustainable toy market will become as large as mass producers like Hasbro. Arie Y Lewin, director of the Center for International Business Education and Research at Duke University, says the likes of Luke’s Toy Factory will probably do well, but remain as a niche market. On his quarterly trips to China, Lewin sees extremely high-quality China-made products. So he doesn’t think the fact that his toys are US-made, alone, will win consumers over. Nor does he anticipate consumers will choose a toy because it’s made of sustainable materials. “If these sustainable toys do well, it’s because the products are interesting and good, that’s it,” he says. He adds that in order for localized and sustainable products to do well, companies must change their products frequently, keeping close tabs on which products consumers like.

Von Goeben adds domestic manufacturing is challenging and requires working with factory owners to help build up their capacity and confidence again after production was outsourced to Asia. And while he’d love to see more US-based companies duplicating Green Toys Inc, making toys with no metal axels, no glue, paint or screws - and from recycled plastic - is tricky and quite technical, he says.

Where Lewin feels optimistic for more ventures like Green Toys Inc and Luke’s Toy Factory is the organic grocery market, which began with Whole Foods Markets and now has spread to unlikely retailers such as Walmart. (This proves, in Lewin’s view, that the consumer demand is there for domestically and/or locally made goods from recyclable and organic materials. He thinks it can grow from a niche market into one embraced globally.) Additionally, US labor costs are becoming more competitive to low-cost countries such as China, and China’s growing middle class provides other opportunities for China-based factories. “All of this may cause more production to return to the US,” Lewin says.

He adds that if US consumers really take to locally made, eco-friendly toys, then the company may become a viable acquisition target. This already happened in 2010 when Wham-O Inc, a large Chinese toy maker, acquired Sprig Toys in Colorado, which used a wood plastic composite from Canada to manufacture electronic toys.

The toy business is risky, Barber notes, and big players typically profit only from the hits. For example, Hasbro’s Easy-Bake Oven has sold 30m products and still sells well after 50 years. He feels unique in that his model ignores that theory. All his trucks will work together, and that’s fun for the consumer. “Kids love this toy and if I can prove you can make quality and affordable products here versus China, that is success.”

","Waste-to-toys: the growing market for eco-friendly, high-quality toys",http://www.theguardian.com,[Debbi G Mccullough],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402695609724/303d8d30-c0da-4915-822f-6da2e8d75b17-1020x612.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=838afb8999eb7816f3e8a9bc487e963a,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/16/eco-friendly-sustainable-toys-growing-market-waste-recycling
1143,"After recent diversity reports from Google and LinkedIn, it's clear that ad hoc solutions aren't sufficient. Here's how Bank of America and Intel moved towards a comprehensive strategy

When Google disclosed the its workforce diversity numbers late last month, it got plenty of attention. The decision to go public with the data was surprising: according to Calvert Investment’s report, Examining the Cracks in the Ceiling, only 7% of the S&P 100 provide full disclosure. However, the numbers themselves, while disappointing, were about what one might expect.



Google reported that only 30% of its workers - and a mere 17% of its technology employees - were female. While most companies don't provide full workforce numbers, 56% of the S&P 100 have no women or minorities in their highest-paid senior executive positions. Women make up only 19% of board of director positions, and only 37 companies have minority women on their board.

Last week, LinkedIn also released its diversity data, revealing that 39% of its workforce is made up of women, and 91% of its US employees are white or Asian.

In the wake of these reports, I considered writing a piece offering a few tips on how some S&P 100 companies are improving their corporate diversity. But after speaking with diversity executives at Bank of America and Intel, which won the Anita Borg Institute's (ABI) Top Company for Women in Computing Award in 2013 and 2014, respectively, it's clear that “tips” aren't a sufficient solution. Building a diverse workforce requires a strategic formula – and a clear awareness that diversity is a key part of a company's value proposition.

The education pipeline



Historically, a big part of the tech hiring dilemma has been a matter of resources: simply put, there weren't enough women and minorities in the job market. But, while the number of women and minorities pursuing computer and information sciences degrees remains lower than that of white males, there has been significant improvement in recent years.

Council of Graduate Schools reports from 2007 to 2012 show impressive strides toward diversity. Among US citizens, there was an 1.4% average annual increase in total enrollment of Asian/Pacific Islanders in computer and information sciences, a 12.3% increase in Latino enrollment, and an average annual increase of 18.8% in enrollment for African Americans.

In the fields of computer, electrical and electronic engineering, the news was more mixed. During the same period, those fields saw a 3.2% average annual decrease in total enrollment of Asian/Pacific Islanders and a 0.5% drop in total enrollment for African American students. Among Latino students, however, the news was brighter: their numbers saw a 5.7% increase.

“While the data around enrollments in graduate programs can’t speak to whether or not women and minorities are being hired, over the last five years we do see a substantial increase in the number of women and some underrepresented minorities in graduate fields traditionally dominated by white males,” said Jeff Allum, director of research and policy analysis for the Council of Graduate Studies.

Denise Menelly, shared service operations executive at Bank of America, suggests that lower computer science graduation rates indicate that companies may need to broaden the scope of their efforts. ""The fact that the pool of women and minorities graduating with computer science degrees is relatively low does not keep us from pushing to meet higher goals,” she says. “It simply means that specific additional effort is required to recruit.""

BoA's efforts includes partnering with the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) on the Aspirations in Computing Talent Development Initiative, and hosting the annual National Award for Aspirations in Computing. Interest in the award has grown exponentially, both in terms of applicants and participants, since it was first launched in 2008. In its first year, fewer than 200 women applied for the award; this year, more than 2,300 did. At the same time, its reach has vastly expanded: the program now has more than 60 local affiliate award competitions.

The NCWIT partnership provides BoA with a venue for attracting potential winners for its high school work assignment program, an eight-week opportunity to work with one of the company’s technology teams. This summer, of the 18 women participating in the program, four are national award winners and 14 are affiliate winners.

Keeping the women you've got

BofA and Intel are also working to retain women and minority employees once they walk through the front door. Where women in general are concerned, Elizabeth Ames, Anita Borg Institute VP of strategic marketing and alliances, notes: “Addressing retention would dramatically improve their representation.” This becomes particularly important for building C-suite and board diversity levels. According to ABI profiles on Bank of America and Intel, both companies retain the vast majority of their female technologists. BoA has only 3% voluntary annual turnover; at Intel, it's 2%.

According to ABI’s report, Women Technologists Count, 52% of women entering science and technology careers left private companies over time – and attrition increased markedly at the mid-career point. In the technology sector, 56% of women in these occupations left over time with cumulative quit rates for women more than double the rate for men. The costs associated with turnover range from 90% to 200% of annual salary.

Intel has seen good results from its Women Principal Engineer and Fellows Forum. Entirely technology-focused, the forum encourages senior technical women to try out ideas in front of a highly technical audience. Each is asked to bring an up-and-coming technical female to network and gain visibility from leadership. Since the launch of the forum in 2006, the number of female principal engineers in the company has more than doubled from 22 to 56.

Intel’s diversity efforts have extended far beyond gender. Its Blueprint for Extraordinary Performance leadership development program, launched in 2009, targets mid-level African American and Latino employees. In the program, which is conducted by an external consultant and Intel's senior leaders, participants meet monthly to receive leadership development training and guidance, and to share what they put into practice. According to Ernie Felix, Intel's diversity education manager for global diversity, education and external relations, the program now has 900 alumni.

Changing internal culture

A big part of the complexity of diversity initiatives lies in the fact that, to be successful, they require significant shifts in a company's internal culture. A big step toward this lies in building an appreciation of the unique value proposition that diversity offers. Intel’s Global Women's Initiative Director, Lori Wilson, explains that ""We are in the business of creating products that solve problems. In order to understand those problems, you have to understand the issues behind them. We can only do that with diverse perspectives.”

Both Intel and Bank of America start their push for diversity at the top of the house, working to ensure that leadership is aware of the demographics of the company and of the market. At the same time, the companies have extended employee training throughout the company, working to address unconscious bias, as well as the ways in which employees are rewarded, recognized and promoted. Not all of these programs seem groundbreaking, but, as Menelly notes, they are critical to ""sustaining momentum and taking action"".

So is it working? The numbers suggest that BoA and Intel are beginning to change diversity ratios within their own workforces. In addition to higher-than-industry-average retention rates, approximately 56% of BofA's global workforce - and 30% of its technology workforce - is female.

Between 2012 and 2013, Intel increased its female workforce by 6.2%; its male and female Latino employees by 6.7% and 13%, respectively; and its African American male and female employees by 6.2% and 7%, respectively.

BoA and Intel's efforts suggest that, where diversity is concerned, transparency involves more than just citing numbers. Sharing what works - the success stories - is equally important in changing the ratios. While most companies don't have access to BoA and Intel's extensive resources, their formula and the initiatives they've undertaken offer a promising blueprint for companies of all sizes.

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that only 30% of Bank of America's workforce is female. This article was amended to reflect that 30% of its technology workforce - and roughly 56% of its global workforce - is female. A previous version also mistakenly referred to the National Center for Women and Information Technology as the National Center for Women in Technology.

1145,"An ethical smartphone, air cleaning carpets and carbon-negative plastic. Sustainability innovation is truly broadening out these days, and the big winners are businesses that are finding new ways to create novel products and save on budgets and resources.

A new study, Sustainia100, identifies 100 leading sustainability innovations from more than 900 technologies and projects to pinpoint how and where innovations are being developed, deployed and put to scale. The study outlines efforts to make sectors from fashion and food to buildings and transportation more efficient and more sustainable.

The result is clear: global markets are currently witnessing a growing diversity in sustainability innovations, which is providing businesses with new opportunities.

We're beginning to see an eclectic mix: wireless technology alerting farmers via text when crops are at risk, Swedish IT systems operating rail traffic in energy efficient ways and 100% biodegradable plastic. Consumers and companies have sustainable options like never before.

These examples might seem futuristic, but they are readily available and have demonstrated environmental, social and economic benefits. The 100 selections are currently being deployed in 142 countries, and arguments for why they should be used are hard to ignore.

Financial incentives

Take the savings made by Icelandic company GreenQloud as an example. Not only does its data storage service reduce CO2 emissions but by keeping servers cool in a cold climate, 30-40% of average data centre costs are cut.

These new energy and resource-optimising solutions are not just eco-friendly. They can also be appealing design alternatives. Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta's beautifully designed office building Powerhouse is the first energy-producing office in the world.

If companies do not gear themselves towards this changing landscape, where efficient and sustainable operations are key to long-term survival, they will not last.

Broader global trends in sustainability

The report shows how the circular economy in particular is a growing focus for market-ready products. Companies are re-thinking consumption, waste, materials and systems-return at an impressive scale.

There is an increasing prevalence towards innovation for reuse, recycling, upcycling or even biodegradation in order to minimise waste. One example is the Italian company, Bio-on, which is replacing petroleum-based plastics with 100% biodegradable plastic made from agricultural waste. While Dutch company, Mud Jeans, has made a business out of leasing jeans, giving customers the option of keeping, swapping or returning them after use for recycling.

A solid trend among the case studies is innovation using data analytics. Numerous big data solutions are improving the performance of utilities, homes and office buildings as well as traffic flows and water pressure to reduce energy and resource consumption. Swedish company Transrail has developed the CATO (Computer-Aided Train Operation) system which makes use of advanced algorithms to operate railway traffic as efficiently as possible.

Fashion with an eye for green

The fashion industry has a history of issues with workers' right and challenges around its polluting production processes. Innovations are now providing the materials, methods and technologies necessary to set new standards throughout supply chains. This involves the use of mobile technology to monitor and survey working conditions and environmental management. For example, in collaboration with suppliers, Levi's has created a water recycling system that saves millions of litres by reducing the amount of water used in the finishing process.

1147,"You will have heard, I am sure, of the Google driverless car. In fact, if you're a regular reader you will be thoroughly familiar with the vehicle if only because this columnist seems to be always going on about it. The justification for this obsession is that the success of the autonomous vehicle project should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who is complacent about the superiority of humans to machines.

That said, there was something oddly reassuring about the original driverless cars. For one thing, they were regular Toyota and Lexus saloons equipped with $250,000 worth of computers, sensors, lasers and associated kit. Secondly, they had steering wheels, gear shifts, brake pedals, rear-view mirrors and all the other appurtenances of a standard-issue car. A human ""driver"" could always take control simply by touching the steering wheel. So, in a way, you could think of it as just a standard vehicle with an autopilot.

There was, however, one slightly unsettling fly in the ointment. It was revealed that the fleet of Google cars had covered over half a million miles on busy Californian roads and that in all those journeys only one had ever been involved in a (minor) accident. It happened when one of the cars was actually been driven by a human. The implications of this might not have been obvious to everyone, but if the Google vehicles were ever to be let loose on public roads, then one industry in particular would sit up and pay attention – insurers. One could envisage the day when car owners would have to pay higher premiums if they wished to take the wheel themselves.

We now know that the implications of the driverless cars' safety record were not lost on Google either. Last week the company rolled out its latest variation on the autonomous vehicle theme. This is a two-seater, pod-like vehicle which scoots around on small wheels. It looks, in fact, like something out of the Enid Blyton Noddy stories. The promotional video shows a cheery group of baby-boomers summoning these mobile pods using smartphones. The pods whizz up obligingly and stop politely, waiting to be boarded. The folks get in, fasten their seatbelts and look around for steering wheel, gear shift, brake pedals etc.

And then we come to the punchline: none of these things exist on the pod! Instead there are two buttons, one marked ""Start"" and the other marked ""Stop"". There is also a horizontal computer screen which doubtless enables these brave new motorists to conduct Google searches while on the move. The implications are starkly clear: Google has decided that the safest things to do is to eliminate the human driver altogether.

At this point it would be only, er, human to bristle at the temerity of these geeks. Who do they think they are? Better, however, to calm down and try to guess at where this is heading.

Here's one way of looking at it. Google is, par excellence – and to a degree rarely seen in industry – an engineering company, and engineers dislike the untidy irrationality of real life. They look at our motorised world and see that we spend fortunes on the purchase, upkeep and operation of cars that are usually driven by a single human, spend a good deal of their time immobilised in urban congestion, and much of the rest of the time parked in streets. They see governments and local authorities driven to distraction, if not to bankruptcy, by the costs of providing roads and infrastructure to support our motoring habit. They see the mortality, environmental and health costs of human-controlled automobiles. And they think: this is nuts.

So, say Google's engineers, why don't we stop thinking of cars as possessions and start thinking of them as services? We all feel the need to own and operate our own cars because taxis are expensive, buses are unreliable and your car is available whenever you need it. But what if urban areas were flooded with Google's autonomous pods, each capable of being whistled up in an instant, using a smartphone which can detect the one nearest to you? It could pick you up and deliver you safely to your destination. And do so much more cheaply than any human-driven vehicle.

Wouldn't that be a more rational way of organising urban transportation?

Until recently, the question would have been moot. But Google's engineers have shown that it's technically feasible. They're throwing down a gauntlet to our political systems, and also to our own prejudices. Oh, and just in case you think that they don't know what they're doing, Google has a stake in Uber, the company that enables you to hail a nearby car by smartphone. Said cars are currently driven by humans, but… well, you get the point.",Will Google's self-driving pods spell the end of the road for car ownership?,http://www.theguardian.com,"[John Naughton, Dan Gillmor, Laura Barton]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401381620587/Look-no-hands--an-artist--011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=b16462b01852e1a08e36f44c7a515369,2014-06-01 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/01/google-self-driving-pods-end-of-road-car-ownership
1149,"Game literacy is becoming a vital skill for understanding digital culture. As the Guardian launches its dedicated Games Week special, games editor Keith Stuart explains why the UK has so much to shout about

In September 2013, game designer Eric Zimmerman wrote what he called the Manifesto For A Ludic Century. His argument was that passive entertainment was a thing of the past, that interactive systems like games have beauty and meaning, and that they help us learn how to answer important questions. Also, they're really good fun.

The Guardian has been covering games for a long time; 10 years ago this summer the Games Blog began, providing a daily look at the most interesting stories from both the mainstream industry and the growing indie scene. This week, with the giant E3 video game event just days away, we felt it was time to celebrate that; to consider the past, but to think about how the games industry works now, and where it's going.



Over the next five days, we'll be bringing you a banquet of specially commissioned features celebrating and exploring games culture – and especially the games developed by British studios.

Although times have been hard, Britain remains in the top five game development countries in the world; it has over 500 studios creating games like Grand Theft Auto, Lego Star Wars, LittleBigPlanet, and Batman: Arkham City. What drives those developers? What makes Britain such a powerhouse in game development? This week, our games editor will be writer-in-residence at some of the UK's most successful studios to find out.



There are two distinct audiences coming to our games coverage: the committed gamers, and the newcomers or concerned parents who want to understand the games world that is such a big part of their children's lives.

We write for everyone, and this week we'll be featuring a series of features explaining some of the basics to people who may only have glimpsed games on a smartphone or through the crack of a teenager's bedroom door.



Games help us understand the world around us

This is a $70bn a year industry; games make more money than Hollywood box office. US research firm DFC Intelligence calculates that there are 1.4bn gamers in the world. We spend 3bn hours a week playing games. This is a mainstream, culturally significant industry often overlooked or dismissed.

We are moving into an era, as Zimmerman put it, where game literacy will be a vital skill; it will be crucial for understanding the consumer technology around us, but it will also be paramount in understanding how digital culture and business operate.



Games are becoming part of everything from finance and medicine to urban planning and education. Games help us to learn and to understand the world around us. We'll cover all that later too.

For now, welcome to games week.



Coming up this week:

• Keith Stuart on how artificial intelligence research for games will create virtual characters that inherit our personalities and achievements - and can be passed down to our children

• Stuart Heritage on why Guildford is the beating heart of the UK games industry

• Cara Ellison on her year of video game sex

1151,"The new operating system for the iPhone was revealed by Apple CEO Tim Cook in San Francisco

Apple demonstrated iOS 8, its newest version of its operating system for iPhones and iPads, at its worldwide developers conference in San Francisco.



The new OS introduced a new Health app to offer ""a single comprehensive overview of your fitness,"" as well as updates to features including Mail and Notification Centre.

The Health app integrates with apps such as Nike+, or even apps made by healthcare providers, to let users manage their health through their iOS devices.

""We believe Apple's healthkit will revolutionise how the healthcare industry interacts with people,"" said John Noseworthy, CEO of the prestigious Mayo Clinic hospital.

Craig Federighi, the company's software chief, demonstrated the new features. Chief among them was a new typing function, called Quicktype, which offers predictive typing suggestions.

Similar to Android keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, Quicktype looks at what a user has previously written and suggests what it thinks the next word in the sentence should be. When replying to a text suggesting dinner or a movie, for instance, it can automatically work out that the ""dinner"" and ""a movie"" are words which are likely to be written next.

Photo handling has also been updated, with Apple offering users the ability to use the cloud to store every photo and video taken on their iOS devices. With iPhones consistently at the top of charts like Flickr's most-used cameras, that change is likely to be well received by snap-happy iPhone users. But the storage is not free – it will cost up to $3.99 a month.

Other features receiving a overhaul include Notification Centre, which now allows users to interact with notifications inline, replying to text messages or liking Facebook updates without opening the app itself. Additionally, the multitasking view of iOS now includes recently contacted people, as well as recently used apps.

Mail, the default iOS email app, received a small haul of updates too, allowing users to reply to, and delete, messages with just a single swipe. ""I think we're all going to love doing Mail this way,"" Federighi said as he demonstrated the email app. And Messages, ""the most-used app on iPhones"" according to Federighi, now offers the ability to mute multi-user chats, send video or audio messages with just a click and a swipe, and photos in the same manner.

Although Apple didn't emphasise the fact, the audio and video messages borrow a feature from ephemeral messaging app Snapchat: they will automatically delete after a short time, apparently to save space on the phone.

Federighi also demonstrated a new Family Sharing service, letting whole families share their photos, calendars and locations with each other. The service also allows children to use the App store themselves through their parents' credit cards, by sending requests to the adults' iPhones when a purchase is attempted.

The total number of iPad users in the US continues to increase, but the expanding tablet market means that Apple is actually losing share of overall users as Samsung and others increase sales. Emarketer expects US tablet users is to fall to 51.8% in 2014, according to down from 54.5% last year.

Apple is expected to claim 12.3 million iPad users in the UK in 2014, which represents roughly 50% of the UK tablet users down from 59% in 2013.

Apple’s share of the US smartphone users will rise to 40.5% up from 40% in 2013 and 36.5% in 2012, according to data from eMarketer. By comparison Google’s Android will claim 50% of smartphone users in 2014, up from 49.5% in 2013.

In the UK, Apple’s numbers are slightly lower. Apple is expected to claim 30.5% of smartphone users this year, up from 29% in 2013, while Android smartphone users will account for 53% of the market in 2014 compared to 54.5% in 2013, according to eMarketer.

1153,"Health app will unite data from a number of separate fitness and wellbeing apps into one iPhone app

Apple unveiled its highly anticipated health data monitoring app on Monday, announcing a slate of more than 20 medical partners in the US and Europe.



Speaking at Apple's annual conference for developers in San Francisco, the senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, introduced Health, an app for iPhone and iPad.

It will be powered by Healthkit, a set of tools that will allow developers to build bespoke apps around health and wellbeing, from sleep monitoring and stress reduction to exercise and blood testing.

""Developers have created a lot of apps for monitoring your health,"" he said. ""But up to now the information gathered by those applications lives in silos. But now you can with HealthKit. A single place where applications can gather the data. And there's an app - Health.

Federighi assured the audience that the privacy of users health information would be protected. ""We carefully protect your privacy – you can decide what you want to share between apps.""

Partners include Cambridge University Hospitals NHS in the UK, and Mount Sinai, UCLA Health and Stanford Hospitals in the US.

1155,"Blood pressure a little high? Need the lights turned off in your home? There's an app for that. Or there soon could be after Apple unveiled the latest plans for its iPhone software on Monday at its developers' conference in San Francisco.

Chief executive Tim Cook heralded the new software, which will gather and store health-related data and also offer integrated control for ""smart home"" devices such as remote-controlled light bulbs.

It will be released in the autumn and run on iPhones and iPads, as ""something only Apple can do"", Cook said, as he pointed to statistics which said that 130m iPhone and iPad buyers in the past 12 months out of about 230m sold were new to Apple's platform.

The ""HeallthKit"" and ""HomeKit"" software are part of a concerted effort by the Californian company to position its smartphone as the hub of peoples' digital lives, much as it did more than a decade ago when it first launched its iTunes software for organising music files.

In a speech to thousands of software developers at the Worldwide Developers conference in San Francisco's Moscone West centre, neither Cook nor Craig Federighi, Apple's software chief, announced any new hardware for the health or smart home categories. But Carolina Milanesi, analyst at the research firm Kantar ComTech, suggested Apple was aiming to get developers to build apps for both sectors before making its own move into them. ""Otherwise you get the Galaxy Gear effect where Samsung announced a $300 smartwatch but there weren't any apps for it, so people say 'what's the use of that?'""

Federighi was at pains to emphasise that the health and smart home systems will not share user data without explicit permission, as it seeks to position itself as an alternative to the datasharing approach used by Google, Facebook and other advertising-supported companies.

However the $3bn purchase of the Beats headphones and music company was not mentioned in the two-hour presentation although Federighi did jokingly make a call to ""a new Apple employee"" the Beats cofounder Dr Dre, who sent developers his best wishes.

Apple also showed off software called ""Handoff"" that will allow iPhone owners to answer incoming phone calls or texts on an iPad or Mac computer.

With new smartphone buyers becoming increasingly hard to find as the US and European markets become ""saturated"", Apple is looking to attract users of Google's Android to use its phones and tablets. Cook put heavy emphasis on the success that the iPhone and iPad have had in China, saying that half of its customers there had switched from Android.

Announcing HealthKit, Federighi said that presently apps retain their data inidvidually but do not interact or connect to make good use of it. ""That information lives in silos,"" he said.

""You can't get a single comprehensive picture.""

The news follows archrival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's announcement last week of a mobile healthdata store called SAMI (Samsung Architecture Multimodal Interactions).

Samsung plans to market SAMI by hosting a developer challenge and setting aside a $50m fund for earlystage digital health entrepreneurs.

The update to the iPhone and iPad software will be released in the autumn, Federighi said. Though Apple made no mention of new iPhones or iPads, those are expected to be shown off just ahead of the software's release, and to ship just after it.

Among the expected updates are an iPhone with a larger screen to capture users who might otherwise shift to the increasingly popular ""phablet"" models, and to win back those who have moved away from the iPhone because they have preferred the larger screens available on Android. Presently the iPhone 5S has a 4in screen, measured diagonally, while products like the Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8 have screens measuring 5in or more, and analyst data shows that such larger screens are increasingly popular.

Apple also showed off new OS X software for its desktop and laptop computers that will automatically connect to an iPhone, so that it will show the identity of a caller, and let them reply to SMSs directly from the screen. Codenamed ""Yosemite"", it will be available as a public beta so that any Mac user can apply to test it.",Apple unveils move towards health and home in new iPhone software,http://www.theguardian.com,[Charles Arthur],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401748592709/Apple-World-Wide-Develope-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d4e57b4660b7ba8015193b8953241a8d,2014-06-02 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/02/apple-unveils-health-and-home-apps-for-iphone
1157,"Secret designs released for Dyson’s 21st birthday show shelved smartglasses way ahead of their time

The technology landscape could look very different if Dyson hadn’t decided to shelve a smartglasses project that had a working prototype more than 10 years before Google’s Glass arrived.



The Dyson Halo, known only by its project number N066 until today, was originally developed in 2001 – a set of augmented reality goggles featuring a full-colour 3D heads-up display the kind that’s currently being developed by Google, Epsom and Vuzix.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest An original sketch of the Dyson Halo. Photograph: Dyson

The glasses were head-mounted on a frame that sat around the back of the head and were powered by a pocket computer that resembled a Sony Walkman.

Halo worked as a communications device, but also as a pocket PC, using audio and visual prompts to overlay information on the real world.

The headset could be folded up for travel. Photograph: Dyson

The headset used two mirrors to reflect the display of two tiny monitors mounted by the wearers’ temples into the eyes to create the illusion of a translucent 10in screen, projected about 1m in front of the eyes.

Google’s Glass, first announced in 2011 and eventually released in 2013, uses a prism mounted above the eye to display at-a-glance information while the computing potion – a smartphone without the cellular radios – is mounted on one of the ear stems.

Siri before Siri

Dyson also built a virtual digital assistant to help the headset wearer, that could read out emails and interpret basic voice commands like an early version of Apple’s Siri or Google Now.

Users typed on a projected virtual keyboard which could track finger motions, while a wrist-worn device acted as a mouse pointer.

The headset could also be used as a simple display for a separate computer.

The project ran for three years, but was eventually shelved as part of Dyson’s focus on the US. Some of the components live on in other projects, specifically around robot vision which is crucial to projects at the Dyson Robotics Laboratory at Imperial College London.

Dyson released details of the Halo headset and two other shelved projects – a filtration system for diesel engines based on the company’s cyclone technology, as well as a hydrogen fuel cell that used the company’s electric motor to boost efficiency and power – as part of the company’s 21st birthday.

The shelved designs display some of the things beyond vacuum cleaners, fans and hand driers that the company has worked on, but decided not to bring to market.

In addition to the £5m joint investment with Imperial College London for Dyson Robotics Lab, the company has recently ploughed £250m into an expansion of its research and development site next to its headquarters in Malmesbury in Wiltshire.

1159,"Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company's newest entry into connected homes at its worldwide developer conference in San Francisco

Apple announced a new ""Home"" app and service that allows an iPhone or iPad to control smart appliances, lights and locks around the home.

The Home app will securely connect to third-party products such as the Philips Hue lightbulbs, Honeywell's thermostats and Withing's smart alarm clocks.

""We’ve come up with HomeKit to allow secure pairing so that only your iPhone can unlock your garage door,” said Craig Federighi, Apple's software chief on stage at WWDC.



‘Get ready for bed, Siri’

Each connected device in the home can be paired securely, but also grouped and linked to specific scenes that can be activated for certain events like getting home from work or leaving the house.

""With Siri integration you can say something like ‘get ready for bed’ and be sure that the garage door is closed, the lights are dimmed and the doors are locked,"" said Federighi.

Apple announced partners for its HomeKit – the developer platform underlying the Home app – including Texas Instruments, Philips, Haier, Netamo, Withings, Honeywell, Marvel, Osram and Broadcom.

Apple hopes that Home will unify internet of things devices around the home into one common protocol, instead of the many separate proprietary protocols that each manufacturer users for its line of devices.

1161,"Nowadays multi-player gaming is about plugging in a headset and being informed of your mother's sexual activities by someone you've never met. It's better with friends and in person

The irony of social media is that it makes you antisocial. Instead of talking to friends, you hunch over your phone and tell internet acquaintances that you're talking to friends, attaching a photo that nobody will ever look at because they're too busy posting their own selfies to Instagram. Ditto social gaming, which has morphed from rowdy groups of drunken idiots shooting their best mates in the face in GoldenEye or good-naturedly beating each other to death in Street Fighter II, to millions of people on their own in darkened rooms, silently killing avatars representing remote strangers on the internet.

Video games were invented as a social medium. Tennis For Two, arguably the first video game ever made, ran on lab equipment and was multiplayer-only. Television games, the humble origin of the multi-billion-dollar games industry, were designed to be enjoyed with friends and relatives. Early-90s consoles were advertised with pictures of perfectly manicured families smiling enthusiastically into their TVs, and came packaged with two controllers. Saturn Bomberman (1996) let up to 10 cosily positioned players blow each other up in charming cartoon mazes, unleashing a frenzy of swearing and explosions few games have since managed to emulate.

Even as games migrated online, many strove to retain the riotous in-the-same-room multiplayer experience. Halo can run on two adjacent TVs, giving up to eight armchair space marines the chance to blast the chops off those sitting next to them. Online, Halo matches take more or less the same form as Call Of Duty: you get shot before being informed of your mother's sexual activities by someone you've never met. Against friends in the same room, the invective is just as focused but funnier, making it part of the entertainment, not something you mute with a weary sigh.

Mario Kart 8

Sony's SingStar was another multiplayer gaming success, bringing the magic and tragedy of karaoke home, allowing you to pound out ballads without psychologically injuring fellow drinkers. But the apex of same-room multiplayer remains Nintendo's Mario Kart series, in which races against your fellow animated go-karters are actually humbling, cheerful life lessons. A round of Mario Kart offers a very practical demonstration of pride coming before a fall, a cocky race leader sure to receive swift karmic retribution at the hands of the game's reliable comedy weaponry.

Of course, online multiplayer gaming isn't all about competition and petty one-upmanship. World Of Warcraft's highly addictive long-term grindathon does let you kill other players' characters, but is more conducive to teaming up to fight beasts that would be too dangerous to tackle alone or planning complex raids on other guilds. People make close friends in World Of Warcraft – friends that in most cases they will never, ever meet. League Of Legends has pushed online play further, becoming a vastly popular spectator sport with prize funds running into millions, making superstars of its most successful players and teams. It helped catapult video game streaming site Twitch.tv from relative obscurity to the brink of a billion-dollar acquisition by Google. But something's missing from this kind of geographically isolated online play. Sure, it means you can enjoy these games even when your pals aren't in town, and encourages the kind of epic, persistent-world gaming that never would have been possible offline, but it lacks the fundamental silliness of real-life interaction. Whether you end up playing Wii Bowling with your mates long into the night or find yourself plunging from pole position to last place in Mario Kart on the wrong end of a blue shell, getting together with people you love to partake in sports that don't actually exist is a joyous, foolish counterpoint to the serious-minded headset-wearing solitude of playing online.

1163,"The Reset the Net campaign aims to encourage direct action, urging visitors to install privacy and encryption tools

Some of the world's largest websites are planning a coordinated day of action on Thursday to oppose mass surveillance online.

The sites, which include Reddit, Imgur and BoingBoing, will be taking part in the campaign, called ""Reset the Net"", in a number of ways.

Some will showing a splash screen to all users, reminiscent of the one used in the successful protests against SOPA, the US copyright bill which many feared would damage the backbone of the internet. But rather than telling users to write to their electoral representatives, this protest will push more direct action, encouraging visitors to install privacy and encryption tools.

Other sites have committed to improving their own privacy as part of the campaign, by enabling standards such as HTTPS, which prevents attackers from eavesdropping on visitors. Such security standards are common in the world of ecommerce, but rarer for sites which don't think of themselves as holding sensitive information.

""We can take back control of our personal and private data one website, one device, one internet user at a time,"" said Reddit's General Manager Erik Martin. ""We’re proud to stand up for our users’ rights and help Reset the Net.""

The campaign is being co-ordinated by Fight for the Future, whose co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng said ""Now that we know how mass surveillance works, we know how to stop it. That’s why people all over the world are going to work together to use encryption everywhere and make it too hard for any government to conduct mass surveillance.

""There are moments in history where people and organisations must choose whether to stand on the side of freedom or tyranny. On June 5th, the internet will show which side it’s on.”

1165,"Consumers now have another alternative to Apple and Google software with the launch of a smartphone powered by Samsung's Tizen

The Samsung Z will be its first smartphone to ditch Google’s Android and run its own Tizen software, the manufacturer has announced.



The launch means that consumers now have more choice of mobile phone software beyond the dominant Google Android and Apple iOS operating systems.

The Samsung Z device will now compete directly with smartphones running Android and Microsoft’s Windows Phone, employing the Tizen software that will be incompatible with Android applications and Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones.

“Samsung is committed to enhancing the mobile experience of consumers with innovation that is both personal and unique to their needs,” DJ Lee, president of global sales and marketing for Samsung noted in a blog post.

“The Samsung Z integrates the power and adaptability of the Tizen platform, enabling users to browse the web faster and utilise applications more effectively.”

The Z has features comparable to Samsung’s flagship Android smartphone, the Galaxy S5, with a 4.8in high definition screen, 2.3GHz quad-core processor and a fingerprint scanner – something the Korean electronics giant only introduced to its mobile devices with the S5 in April. The Samsung Z will launch in Russia first with plans to expand to other markets.

Tizen versus Android

Samsung’s Tizen software is similar to Android and based on the Linux open source software, but is controlled by companies including Samsung and Intel, rather than Google. It is not compatible with Android and its applications. Android development is driven by Google with the Android Open Source Project and the Open Handset Alliance, of which Samsung is also a member.

Tizen affords Samsung more control over its software and avoids the need to include Google's software, search and applications such as Gmail, Google Maps and Google+. It also allows Samsung reduce its dependence on Google, something the company has tried in the past with its own Bada smartphone software, which eventually became part of Tizen.

Samsung expects Tizen devices could make up as much as 15% of the company’s mobile shipments per year, a potential threat to Google’s Android where Samsung makes up 65% of all Android devices, according to data from analytics firm Localytics.

Samsung claimed 31.3% of fourth-quarter smartphone shipments last year, with Apple making up 15.3% of the market in second with Samsung’s Korean rival LG in third with 4.8%, according to data from IDC.

‘What does it mean to consumers? Nothing’

“The launch of Tizen on Samsung handsets provides an exciting proposition for emerging market consumers, where accessibility to truly localised content and appropriate payment mechanics could at last become a reality,” said Marco Veremis, chief executive of mobile marketing specialists Upstream.

Others are not quite as enamoured with the prospect of yet another mobile software platform.

“What does it mean to consumers? Nothing. No additional value to make the switch from Android worth it,” said Francisco Jeronimo, research director at firm IDC.

The Samsung Z follows the introduction of the Tizen-powered Gear 2 smartwatch, which replaced the originally Android-powered Galaxy Gear smartwatch from 2013. Samsung recently issued a software update that replaced Android with Tizen software on the Galaxy Gear, removing Android from all of Samsung’s smart wearable devices.

The smartphone will be shown off at Samsung's Tizen developer conference on 3 June.

1167,"The latest version of Apple's operating system for desktop computers, Mac OS X, was shown off at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco

Apple's Mac OSX software has had a radical design overhaul, bringing its desktop and smartphone software closer together, and introducing a new feature called ""Continuity"" that lets users easily switch between the two.



Continuity includes an expansion to the company's AirDrop software, allowing users to send files back and forth between iPhones and Macs. But it also lets users move work back and forth between the two at the click of a button, as well as automatically tether Macs to iPhones to use mobile internet on the move.

Users of both Macs and iPhones will also be able to use their computers to send and receive text messages and phone calls – even to non iPhone users.

Craig Federighi, Apple's software chief, demonstrated the feature by making a live call on stage to the ""new Apple employee"" Dr Dre, who joined the company when Apple bought Beats for $3bn last month.

""New employee orientation starts at nine, and you don't want to miss the free T-shirt,"" Federighi joked.

iCloud Drive - directly competing with Dropbox

Federighi also demonstrated updates to the Mail, Spotlight and Safari apps, as well as a whole new cloud syncing service called iCloud Drive, at Apple's annual conference for developers in San Francisco.

An expansion of iCloud, Drive is a direct competitor to services like Dropbox, letting users share files and folders directly in Finder, the file manager on Apple's computers. The change marks a step away from the company's app-focused cloud services, allowing users to share files regardless of the application that created them.

Federighi also demonstrated an overhauled version of Spotlight, the built-in search tool.

In Yosemite, users will be able to not only use Spotlight to launch apps and search for files on their computer, but also to search the web, and for locations in the real world. But the app will use Bing for its web search by default, further stripping integration with Google from Apple's operating systems.

The changes to Mail include a new feature that lets users send attachments via Apple's servers, if their recipient can't take the file directly. Apple will allow attachments up to 5GB through the feature, which works when emailing non-Apple users as well as Apple users.

50% of Mac users on Mavericks

For the first time, Apple is offering a public beta version of its new OS, meaning all users will be able to give it a try this summer.

Federighi and Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, shared statistics on the adoption of the previous version of Mac OS X, Mavericks. More than 50% of users have upgraded to Mavericks, which was made free last year.

""That's the fastest OS adoption in history,"" Cook said. That would put it on slightly under 40m computers worldwide, based on Apple's own data of 72m users given last year.

Cook compared it to Windows 8, which shipped a year before Mavericks: ""It's on about 14% of PCs,"" Cook said.

The name ""Yosemite"" was finally chosen as the codename for the next version after various suggestions based on place names ""OS X Oxnard"", ""Rancho Cucamonga"", and ""Weed,"" joked Federighi.

Originally codenamed ""Syrah"", OS X 10.10 is the 11th version of Apple's operating system, and the second to use its new naming system based on Californian place names.

1169,"Britain has always punched above its weight in the video game industry. For many years it was in the world's top three games developing countries, just behind the US and Japan. And although Canada has crept ahead in recent years, the British Isles remain a stronghold of innovative and often idiosyncratic design.

So to celebrate the county's profound contribution to interactive entertainment history, here are the 30 best British games of all time, as selected by three of the Guardian's regular games writers. Rather arbitrarily, we've gone for whole series' if the quality is consistent, and single titles if not. Sometimes we've just plain cheated.

As ever, please feel free to add your own favourites in the comments section – we're bound to have missed some wonderful titles.

Batman Arkham Asylum (Rocksteady, 2009, various platforms)

Rocksteady approached DC's venerable comic book crime-fighter with a degree of care and respect matched by no other previous game-maker. The design draws inspiration from 2D classics such as Super Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the Night. It presents a relatively small, gated world; each area within is accessible only when Batman unlocks the requisite skill. In this way its mysteries unfurl with rare elegance. But it's the feel of the character that proves most alluring. In combat Batman strikes with power and grace. In the shadows, he moves with cat-like grace, flitting from pillar to gargoyle in silence. In dialogue he growls through his lines. A definitive treatment.

Burnout Paradise (Criterion, 2008, various platforms

As brash as it was slick, Burnout was always an arcade racer with teeth to spare. But Paradise was a revelation. It replaced 'Next Race' and menus with twenty-six square miles of open-world, squeezing a country's worth of diversions into its packed terrain, and then let everything happen on-the-fly. Effortless to drop into, gorgeous from any angle, and always easy to lose hours to, Burnout Paradise is also remarkable for Criterion's free post-launch support. Six years on, Paradise City still looks and feels like it.

Cannon Fodder (Sensible, 1993, various platforms)

""Cannon Fodder"" is a pretty horrific phrase, but a game where your little soldiers mattered more than anything. Jools and Jops were your earliest, ever-so-vulnerable troops in Cannon Fodder, and the longer you kept them alive the better they got. The game is a top-down shooter that alternates between deadly precision and ice-rink mayhem – where, if a soldier falls, the size of the tombstone reflected their time with you. Developer Sensible Software's genius shows in how Cannon Fodder is so anti-war, yet the intro song remains accurate: ""War! Never been so much fun!""

Championship Manager / Football Manager (Sports Interactive, 1992-, various platforms)

Set up by two brothers, Paul and Oliver Collyer, Sports Interactive has been making football management games for over two decades. But to compare 1992's Championship Manager '93 to last year's Football Manager 2014 (the name changed in 2003) would be like men against boys. This is because Football Manager, more than any other series, shows the value of iteration and regular releases. Over two decades the game has become more detailed, in-depth, slicker, smarter, and knowing about the crazy job it simulates. There are more superficially exciting games, but few as all-consuming and rewarding.

DJ Hero (Freestyle Games, 2009, various platforms)

DJ Hero wasn't the first videogame exploration of turntablism – that accolade belongs to Beatmania, the Japanese game that formalised the use of plastic peripherals in video games to approximate musical instruments. DJ Hero's set-up was more serious, however, in both the design of the controller and the game's mechanics too, which involve crossfading between two pieces of music according to on-screen directions, as well as reversing and scratching a turntable to rouse a virtual crowd. The soundtrack was created in collaboration with DJ Shadow, Z-Trip, DJ AM, Grandmaster Flash, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Daft Punk, a studded line-up that, unfortunately, failed to reignite the audience's waning interest in music games at the time.

Dungeon Keeper (Bullfrog, 1997, PC)

The perfect blend of concept and content, Dungeon Keeper is an RTS where you play the bad guy – setting up a deathtrap of many rooms, tinkering until it purrs, and then watching the heroes try to invade. Dungeon Keeper was one of many great games from Guildford's Bullfrog Productions, sadly now defunct, and perhaps the best example of its mischievous humour and ability to put a a distinctive spin on familiar ideas.

Elite (David Braben and Ian Bell, 1984, various platforms)

It must say something that the greatest game of the 1980s presented a cold-hearted world where the only rules were get rich and don't get caught. Elite began as a game about dogfighting but, when co-developers David Braben and Ian Bell found this a little dull, a layer of amoral capitalism was added on top – the player can trade everything from food to weapons to slaves. What makes Elite resonate even now is the vast scale of its eight galaxies; the feeling that there's always something new to find. What makes it a classic is that there always was.

Fable 2 (Lionhead, 2008, Xbox 360)

Fable II is a celebration of the disorderly English fairytale, all fart jokes and buxom maids serving sloshing tankards of ale mixed up with Robin Hood-style chants of revolution and seasoned with the old magic of the countryside. As you canter through Albion's green and pleasant land, sheepdog by your side, thwacking trolls and flirting with the local men or women (this progressive game allows you to role-play any sexuality) you're free to choose whether you'll be good, evil or some more honest shade between. It's story is well-told, its soundtrack glorious. But most of all this is a generous, forgiving game that charms as much as it challenges.

Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved (Bizarre Creations, 2005, Xbox 360)

Originally made as a tech demo by a bored programmer, Geometry Wars, would come to define Xbox Live Arcade as the premier platform for new games created in an old style. An analogue twin stick shooter the game takes the principles of Robotron 2084 (the 1982 arcade classic where one stick is used to direct movement and another to direct bullets) and pares the venerable arcade shooter back even further. You play to delay the inevitable: dodging the incoming aliens and bullets in the midst of a symphony of exploding lights and sounds till you're finally overwhelmed. Pure and beautiful.

Goldeneye 007 (Rare, 1997, Nintendo 64)

Originally designed as a light-gun game in the style of Sega's arcade classic Virtua Cop, Rare's eventual take on the Bond myth – by far the most successful video game adaptation of Ian Fleming's series – demonstrated that the First Person Shooter could translate from the PC to the living room. From its cast of flailing Soviet soldiers to its elegant level design to its assured multiplayer, nobody's done Bond in video game better than Rare. Launched two years after the film on which it's based had left the box office, Goldeneye 007 sold slowly but steadily, breaking the ground from which Halo and Call of Duty would later grow.

Grand Theft Auto (DMA/Rockstar North, 1997-, various platforms)

The term 'virtual world' always has and will be thrown around thoughtlessly, and yet how few games deserve such praise. The first two instalments of the Grand Theft Auto series had, in embryonic form, freedom and chaos – but DMA Design's Grand Theft Auto 3D changed everything. It's not just the technical achievement, the vistas, crowds and cars that improve with each instalment, or the sheer production values – licensed tracks, famous comedians, TV shows, and voice talent. It's the choice. Players can be criminals, sure, and go on pyrotechnic rampages. But just as many put on a nice suit, get their favourite car, and set out for a country drive with the radio on. GTA is one of the few games to promise freedom, and then deliver something like it.

Lego Star Wars (Traveller's Tales, 2005, various platforms)

The idea to combine Denmark's most enduring toy with the cinematic imagination of George Lucas' most enduring science fiction myth was simple, unexpected and, with properties this gargantuan, risky. Traveller's Tales succeeded by striking a delicate balance of childlike irreverence and keen respect towards the source material, reducing the films' narrative down to a series of un-voiced pantomime scenes, while swapping out the fire and fury of its climactic battles with a shower of plastic bricks and coins. Parents and children could play together, breaking down the scenery with gleeful swipes of their lightsabers before rebuilding the pieces into unexpected shapes. The result established a template that has subsequently been used to rebuild colossi of contemporary family cinema, from Harry Potter to Indiana Jones.

Lemmings (Dma Design, 1991, various platforms)

Some games defy categorisation. Lemmings is like a puzzle game crossed with a tech demo, one that marries leisurely yet short play sessions to strategic thought and twitchy timings. It is unique and, over twenty years later, there's still nothing like it. DMA Design created 120 stages filled with devilish traps and fiendish puzzles, and every Lemming animation was imbued with more floppy-haired personality than entire other games. The British industry went on to produce glitzier masterpieces, but will it ever top the originality and purity of Lemmings? Oh no!

LittleBigPlanet (Media Molecule, 2008, PlayStation 3)

LittleBigPlanet started life as am indie project, conceived by a handful of breakaway developers before, as the idea gained shape and momentum, it became global poster-boy for Sony's PlayStation 3. Sackboy is the side-scrolling platform game's star, a knitted doll seemingly propelled by joy, leaping through the air from platform to platform like a puppy launching itself to bite at a Frisbee. It's handcrafted world, all cardboard and fabric texture, is quite unlike the futuristic surfaces that define most current video games, and, once the game is done, players are able to fashion their own levels and send them out into the world for others to try. Media Molecule's creation is both a humble platform game, and a platform for others to make games on -- at once, big and little.

Manhunt (Rockstar North, 2003, various platforms)

Time was that Rockstar North revelled in being the bete noir of British tabloids. And so was born Manhunt, a brutal game too clever by half for its many critics. Manhunt is nasty. You play a death row inmate given a surprise second chance, 'directed' through levels where you hide from and kill gang members. An unblinkered examination of the agency, nature and pleasure of videogame violence, Manhunt was unfortunately taken at face value by many – but, in 2014, is as relevant as ever.

Manic Miner / Jet Set Willy (Software Projects, 1984, various platforms)

This is your 2-for-1 cassette tape of the day, the main productions of designer Matthew Smith, a man with an eye for the surreal that made these classics then upped and left the industry behind. Manic Miner casts you as Willy, trapped with a dwindling air supply in a 20-screen mine filled with toilet seats and poisoned pansies. But Jet Set Willy is Smith's lasting achievement – a complex twitch platformer full of tricks, where Willy has to clean the mansion he bought with the proceeds of the first game. JSW remains fondly-remembered for set-pieces like 'The Nightmare Room' – filled with ghostly housekeepers, Willy suddenly turns into a flying mouse and has to dodge giant feet.

Micro Machines (Codemasters, 1991, various platforms)

Codemasters would later become one of the UK's best-regarded racing game studios, stewards of valuable licenses such as TOCA and Formula One. But in 1991 the studio kept its vision small, racing inch-long cars along billiards tables, kitchen counters and through the tall grass in Micro Machines. The game's appeal reflects that of Joe Johnston's film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, released two years earlier: the opportunity to view the world's from an insect's perspective. Moreover, the game allowed children to bring their toy car races to vivid life, where every table edge becomes a cliff-top drop, every paperclip a hazard on the track.

New Star Soccer (Simon Read, 2012, iOS)

A mobile phone game that meets the apparent restrictions of its platform with towering ambition: to recreate both the on-pitch drama of the beautiful game as well as the off-pitch detail of the footballers' relationships and lifestyle. In Simon Read's BAFTA-award winning game you play as a single player. Whenever the ball lands at his feet you take control of the game. You draw your finger back to set the power of a shot or pass and then watch to see how the interaction affects the flow of the match. In between games you can train to improve certain character parameters, purchase new equipment and spend cash earned from matches and sponsorship deals. The result is a game as nuanced and comprehensive as many multi-million dollar franchises.

Paradroid (Andrew Braybrook, 1985, various platforms)

Set over several decks of a vast spaceship, this stylistically ingenious puzzle shooter put the player in control of a weedy robot, looking to destroy all the other droids roaming the craft's many rooms and corridors. The blasting action is fun, but the innovative addition of a mini-game allowing you to attack and over-take the circuits of other more powerful bots is the defining achievement. Programmer Andrew Braybrook, who also made the surreal Gribbly's Day out and stunning space shooter Uridium, squeezed every pixel of graphical performance out of the 8bit platforms – and the tension of exploring the labyrinthine space ship decks remains as compulsive as it was 30 years ago.

Populous (Bullfrog, 1989, Amiga)

The game that established Peter Molyneux as one of Britain's most storied and, at times, controversial designers, came about through a misreading of the phonebook. The PC manufacturer Commodore called Molyneux's company Taurus to offer the use of its computers by accident: they meant to call 'Torus'. Molyneux went along with the call, secured some computers for his studio and the result was the first 'God Sim', a game in which the game assumes the role of a divine protector who must increase the number of his followers so that they are able to decimate their rivals.

Race Driver: Grid (Codemasters, 2008, various platforms)

Driving games tend towards extremes: shell-tossing whimsy or straight-faced simulation. But Grid saw a gap, weaved through, and took off – this was a racer with character. The cars are iconic, the tracks are fine-tuned racecourses rather than authentic recreations, and it has a masterful gamey touch. A rewind button. Grid's production values are off the charts, but it's the ability to correct your mistakes – especially as you get better and they become fewer – that makes this a permanent game. Other racers have other priorities. Grid is simply an amazing ride.

Rome: Total War (Creative Assembly, 2004, Mac/PC)

The first game in the Total War series to be fully-3D also happened to hit upon the greatest possible subject matter. The battles of Rome are among history's greatest and developer Creative Assembly doubled the impact by recreating its armies with historical fidelity. And for the first time, Total War meant Total War. The battlefield is one thing, but here your success depends as much on trade routes, technologies, and spies; get caught out of position, and Hannibal may well re-write history to his liking. A world of miniatures that zooms out – and out and out, Rome: Total War is one of strategy gaming's pinnacles.

SingStar (Sony London, May 2004, PS2)

By 2004 the music game revolution was in full swing, led by Konami and its exacting approach to rhythm detection in Japan, and Harmonix with its air-guitar posturing in the West. The London-made SingStar was unlike either tradition. Rather, this easy-going, stylish karaoke game that was approachable in a way that neither Dance Dance Revolution nor Guitar Hero could equal. The game could detect the pitch of its two players' singing, scoring each on their performance and turning the drunken revelry of the karaoke bar into something approaching a competitive sport.

Skool Daze (David and Helen Reidy, 1984, Spectrum/C64)

A genuine charmer as well as an original, Skool Daze shows that you don't need mega specs and 8 gigs of RAM to create something truly memorable and evocative. You play schoolboy Eric, and on-screen can see the whole school and other characters – the headmaster, teachers, the bully, the swot and so on. Your goal is to get Eric's report card out of the headmaster's safe, but there were countless ways of doing this. And the pleasure of Skool Daze wasn't in beating the game anyway, but in playing around with it – causing mischief for others to take the blame, setting traps, or just watching the little people tick over.

Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe (Bitmap Brothers, 1990, Atari ST/Amiga)

Video games more often imitate sports than invent them, but Speedball 2 is a glorious exception, a futuristic cyberpunk amalgamation of handball and ice hockey that reward violence and accuracy in equal measure. This sequel is the stronger game: increasing the size of teams from five players to nine and placing targets on the floor and walls that can be hit for bonus points. There's a pornographic delight to the game's cartoon violence, but its true joy is in the speed and jostle of play, where each goal is a triumph accompanied with a dopamine jolt.

TxK (Llamasoft, 2014, PlayStation Vita)

Jeff Minter, who lives on a farm in Wales, has been making games for just under four decades. An indie developer before there were indie developers, Minter has created countless games but will always be synonymous with Tempest. The original 1981 arcade game was created by the brilliant Dave Theurer, but over the decades our maverick has refined and reworked the tube shooter into a psychedelic hedonist's delight. Tempest 2000 is oft-cited as the highpoint, but the relatively recent TxK somehow manages to be even more colourful and intense – and as reliably brilliant as ever.

Timesplitters 2 (Free Radical Design, 2002, various platforms)

What do you do when you've made Goldeneye and Perfect Dark? For five former employees of Rare the answer was setting up their own studio, Free Radical Design, and hitting the Playstation 2's launch with the smooth-as-silk multiplayer-focused FPS Timesplitters. But it was Timesplitters 2 that really showed Free Radical's talents – the greatest local multiplayer of its era, hundreds of characters and ways to play, 60 FPS and stylised art that looks good even now. In a world where every device is online it's clear that the only thing Timesplitters got wrong, ironically enough, was arriving too soon.

Tomb Raider (Core design, 1996, various platforms)

Lara Croft, the 27-year-old archaeologist daughter of Lord and Lady Henshingly-Croft may not have been video gaming's first cultural icon, but she was the first to grace the magazine covers of Face, Time and Rolling Stone and to model for that bastion of middle English propriety: Marks and Spencer. Croft's handsome frame sold magazines and lingerie but her success was founded on a more resolute foundation: the taut, imaginative puzzle platform game she fronted. Since 1996 she has proven an inexhaustible icon, both in terms of her athleticism (the endless games, filled with endless tombs) and her marketing power.

UFO: Enemy Unknown (Mythos Games, 1994, various platforms)

Better known as X-COM: UFO Defense, from developer Mythos' small studio in Chipping Sodbury came an RTS balancing small-scale engagements and global management that, at first, chewed up and spat out the unwary. Minute in detail yet allowing freeform progress in each playthrough, X-COM is an oft-terrifying game about facing an alien invasion that depends on brass balls as much as careful plotting. Every player has tales of derring-do, last-minute escapes and determined hold-outs – and the stories they don't want to tell, about the time no-one came home.

Wipeout (Psygnosis, 1995, PlayStation)

Wipeout, a hover ship racer launch title for Sony's PlayStation in the West, marked the passing of video gaming's perception from childish diversion to the cultural zeitgeist. With futuristic, Japanese-esque packaging designed by the now-defunct Designers Republic agency, and a soundtrack from mid-90s club artists such as the Chemical Brothers, Leftfield, Orbital and Prodigy, the game is often remembered for its style more than its substance. But Wipeout's appeal runs deeper than its presentation: a racing game that demonstrated Sony's new machine's power, and a fresh way to paint Mario Kart's hustling road races. The sequel, Wipeout 2048, is the more refined game, but the debut's impact is unrivalled.

1171,"The company has designs for a system that allows children younger than 13 to be supervised by parents, according to a new patent

Facebook is working on a way to allow children under 13 years old join the social network.



The company has designs for a system that allows children younger than 13 to be supervised by parents, according to a new patent, to comply with the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa), which prohibits children under 13 from using online services that collect data without explicit “verifiable parental consent”.

Facebook currently bans users under 13 from joining the social network.

“Child safety advocates, policymakers and companies have discussed how best to help parents keep their kids safe online,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement sent to the Guardian. “Like any responsible company, we looked at ways to tackle this issue, but a patent application based on two-year-old research is not a predictor of future work in this area.”

Parental controls and authorisation

The patent application filed in November 2012 was published last week by the US Patent Office describing a system that allows parents to authorise and supervise Facebook accounts for children.

The parent would first have to verify their own identity, followed by their relationship with the child before allowing the creation of a child's account. Parents would then have parental controls tools to restrict access to certain content, friends and third-party applications such as Facebook games Farmville and Candy Crush.

Child accounts would also have strict privacy controls privacy and permissions allowing parents to approve certain actions.

A system proving the identity of a parent and their consent for children under 13 to join any service that collects data would likely have to be approved by the US Federal Trade Commission, which enforces Coppa.

Access to children’s data and their access to online services is governed under the Data Protection Act in the UK, with extra guidance from the UK data protection watchdog the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). ICO is currently promoting the education of information rights to children to help them decide what is appropriate and safe to share online.

Any new system to allow preteens to join a service like Facebook would need to meet ICO guidelines.

'Children are, in fact, now on Facebook'

While Facebook currently prohibits children under 13 from joining the service, many children already join and use Facebook as verifying a person’s age is difficult online, especially for those without official government-issued identity documents or other age-related identities.

“The truth of the matter is that children are, in fact, now on Facebook, with or without parental oversight. They won't stop getting on there, regardless of whether or not Facebook is kept from straightforwardly accepting preteen members,” explained Lisa Vaas from security company Sophos in a blog post.

Facebook actively attempts to remove underage children, with around 800,000 preteens removed from the service through a tiered screening process in 2012 alone, according to data from Consumer Reports, which also estimated that there were still 5.6 million underage accounts on Facebook, many created with the help of parents.

Facebook said it has nothing to announce regarding allowing those under the age of 13 to use the social network and that the patent was in response to research being conducted in the area but is not indicative of future work.

1173,"Are we happy to allow companies to gather details of every heartbeat and minute of sleep, then deny us access to that data?

For a company that aims to excel in making information and products clean and easy to use - and one with an eye on consumer electronic devices for lucrative markets - it makes absolute sense that Apple should exploit the trend for fitness and health data with Health, its new app.

Apple insisted from the first mention of its new data app Health on Monday that users' privacy will be protected. But with a rapidly growing industry built around aggregating and organising health data, how far and wide is our health data being shared?

Like many people, I’m more into the principle of fitness than the practice. I’m don't go to a gym, climb mountains or ride bikes down them, and am as far from early morning runners as its possible to be. I’d have my breakfast in bed, if I trusted anyone else to make a decent coffee.



But I also like gadgets, so Fitbit's activity tracker - the slick, sliver of a device called the One - motivated me to start exercising and I've been using one ever since.

My first device was run over by a car (I wasn't wearing it at the time) and Fitbit replaced it free of charge. I've worn it daily ever since.

Until today.



Before the break up, we’d had happy times. The experience of having technology as an integral part of your day, as part of your body, can be enlightening - a constant stream of information that reflects your behaviour and reports on your state of health. When you analyse this realtime feedback, you can't help but adjust your activity and, in a way, your behaviour.

I never felt bullied by my Fitbit. It was more a gentle coercion to do a little bit more of what was good for me so that I'd reach my daily exercise goal, and keep up with the handful of others with whom I share my data.

Or rather I thought it was only a handful of others. But it seems that data is being spread far wider than we thought. In reality it seems we are losing control over some of our most intimate data, handing over details of every heartbeat we have and minute we sleep.

Apple may well leap ahead in this market, but at the moment FitBit is exploiting its lead. Sharing health data with third parties is potentially lucrative; think of the targeted drug adverts, health food drinks, low-carb low-calorie drinks and the rest. Imagine the life insurance salesmen either beating down your door or blocking your calls if the data says you look like a bad risk.

Who is aggregating your health data - and at what cost?

We should have seen this coming - it's pretty obvious that if you are aggregating data into a server you don't own, someone will think to make use of it. This happens all the time - it can even be useful to both company and customer - and it would be foolish of any firm, FitBit included, not to consider the value of this data in their business model. But at what cost to the individual?

Early 2012 when I signed up to Fitbit, I paused to think about where my data was going, how it might be used, and couldn't think of a reason not to let them have my seemingly innocuous step data.

But it's not just step data anymore. Unified hubs will give one overview of together data from apps tracking your weight, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, glucose levels, heart rate...

Fitbit's privacy statement is more than 3,000 words long and regularly updated. It's reasonably open about what they will do with your health data, for those who bother to read it. (Anyone out there have their solicitor give those documents the once over? Me neither).



But I am no longer happy to share what they want me to share.



So, what if, like me, you don’t feel comfortable with Apple or FitBit’s vision of health data collection? What are the alternatives?



New brands and devices surface regularly, but three of the best looking devices are Jawbone, Shine and Garmin.



How much to access health data? Garmin's API access costs $5,000

Garmin offers some interesting data-export options that would allow me to use my health data in useful ways, but there are worrying limitations in their Application Programming Interface (API), the window that specifies how programs talk to one another.



In the Garmin’s case, the major limitation seems to be that the API is no longer free to access. It's bad enough that APIs usually offer access to a limited amount of data, but Garmin now ransoms it out at $5,000 a go.

This means small software developers and coders who might want to design an app, or even someone who wants to get a complete dataset into a spreadsheet, have to pay through the nose for the right to do so. That’s hardly accessible to the not-for-profits and passionate bedroom coders who do some of the most interesting and innovative work in this brave new data rich world.



This cuts right to the heart of the issue of data collection and data sharing. Why would I want my personal health data to be collected, shared, turned into profits by a company that will not also allow me to use that same data because it limits access to its API, that critical information bridge?

Am I happy to collect information from the very heart of myself, and then not be able to use it as I want? For this data to be accessible only for wealthy corporate use?



No, I’m not. They’re my vital signs, my vital statistics and I should be able to do with them what I want, not sign the rights to them over to someone else.



The importance of the magical APIs and getting them right is hard to overstate; it’s partly about about taking data and making it genuinely useable, or ""rich"", rather than just spewing out raw data and numbers - in the case of activity monitors, heart rate and distance traveled and so on.

And it’s partly about tailoring use of data, so I can choose what apps and systems I share my information with, rather than giving one firm a monopoly over where my vital statistics are sent and analysed.

An open source alternative

Fluxstream is an open-source, non-profit organisation which deals with personal data, including the sort of health-related information collected by the likes of FitBit and Garmin.

Candide Kemmler and Anne Wright, Fluxstream’s founders, make a persuasive case for having open and accessible APIs.

""Our take is that people should be able to use their data freely and that a good syncing API is the best way to enable that. Data export is simply not enough,” said Kemmler.

The basic requirements are a few data points, and the ability to transfer them is all it takes.



“These simple requirements are very often not met and one has to go through a whole lot of hoops and loops to achieve the desired result.""

Is charging for health data sustainable?

Companies don’t always want to give something away when they can sell it -even if it enhances user experience and ultimately makes their product more desirable.

In the short term, selling APIs can make a firm more money. Long term, they’re more likely to make a product obsolete by limiting its horizons.



The sooner these device manufacturers realise we want, and have a right to, full access to the data we use their machines to aggregate, the sooner we can curate it how and where we want.



Networked devices need to connect and share freely, and Apple, Fitbit or Garmin must acknowledge that. It will make these services for more compelling when they do, so that we can freely export, sync and analyse the data their devices allow us to compile.



These data steams show the intimate workings of our bodies, our lives. It's not just the ""internet of things"" they are building technology for. It's an internet of people.

1175,"Safari on the iPhone and iPad is used more than any other mobile browser, with 38 million users a day

Steve Jobs may have wanted the iPad to be free of porn, but that certainly hasn’t stopped users turning to the device’s Safari browser view porn sites.



Safari on the iPhone and iPad is used more than any other mobile browser, according to new data from Pornhub, one of the biggest free pornography sites, with 38 million users a day.

“Over the past year, Pornhub has seen a major shift in the types of traffic coming to our site,” said a company spokesperson in a blog post. “Of the 38 million people who visit Pornhub each day, over half are now using mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.”

iPad claims the lion's share

Apple’s iPad was the most used tablet by quite some margin, with Safari claiming 73% of the porn site’s tablet visitors, with Google’s Chrome, which is available on the iPad and Android tablets, a distant second used by 13.6% of visitors.

The Android browser built into Google’s mobile software came third with 7.8% of tablet browsers, leading Amazon’s Kindle Fire browser Silk with 4.8% and leaving BlackBerry’s Playbook in last with 0.69%.

The data is not quite as surprising as it sounds, despite the iPad’s Safari browser dominating Pornhub’s tablet browsing. Apple’s iPad maintains a dominant share of overall tablet users in the majority of developed markets, including the US where it had a 54.5% share and the UK where it had 59% share of tablet users in 2013, according to data from research firm eMarketer.

iPhone users also avid viewers

Apple’s iPhone users are also avid viewers of Pornhub. The smartphone version of Safari claims a 38.2% share of all the porn site smartphone users globally, beating the Android browser, which holds a 29.4% share. Google’s Chrome mobile browser, which is available on both Android and the iPhone, holds an 18% share and Window Phone’s Internet Explorer comes in fourth with 2.4% of visits.

Opera’s Mini browser, which is available on various smartphones including BlackBerrys was in last place with 2.3% of visitors.

Apple’s iPhone held a 40% share of smartphone users in the US in 2013, while int eh UK Apple’s numbers are slightly lower with a 29% share in 2013, according to eMarketer.

'More than half of Internet Explorer users using latest version 11'

Desktop browsers were still used by a significant number of Pornhub’s purveyors, with Chrome leading the charge at 44.4%, with Internet Explorer coming second with a 23.2% share, leading Firefox with 20.1%, Safari with 7% and Opera with 2.6%.

The porn site’s desktop browser statistics mirror the current browser marketshares, according to data from research firm StatCounter, which places Chrome in the top spot with a 45.22% of global browsers, leading Internet Explorer at 21.43% and Firefox at 18.72% in April.

Pornhub also analysed the distribution of Internet Explorer versions, which showed Microsoft’s attempts to get users to upgrade to the latest and safest version 11 is gaining traction with porn viewers, although discontinued versions including IE5, which was released 15 years ago, are still in active use.

“More than half of Internet Explorer users coming to Pornhub are using the latest version 11. Version 10 was released in 2012 and brings 17.5% of the traffic. Version 9 (2011) and Version 8 (2009) each bring just over 14% of visitors. IE 7 (2005) and IE 6 (2001) still account for 2.5% of our traffic, and unbelievably we do still have daily visitors from IE 5 looking for a porn fix,” said the report.

1177,"Arcade games from the 1970s and 80s gain new lease of life on dedicated sites where fans can watch, play and reminisce

Whatever your age, if you're a fan of video games, there will always be a few titles that carry the heavy scent of nostalgia. Just as one looks back at photos and reminisces about flared/stonewashed/cut-off jeans, the gamer, too, will fondly remember the consoles and games of their bubblegum years.

Whether that be playing Pac-Man in the arcades; the introduction of the Atari 2600; whizzing through levels of Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Mega Drive; the way the sucker-feet of a Quickshot joystick would pop unstuck at a critical point; or the helicopter hair of Rayman on the original Playstation, memories tend to be as hard to shake as an addiction to Angry Birds.



The games industry is currently in rude health. The global industry is on track to be worth $86bn by 2016, according to the Entertainment Software Association, and the European market is worth over $20bn alone.

But however impressive the games of today, there's no buzz quite like revisiting the gentle classics, dusting off C90s to stick clunkily into a ghettoblaster, or unearthing a creaky VHS.

The internet, as ever, is here to help. Websites have cropped up allowing fans to play legal versions of 20- and 10-year-old games in-browser. So-called easter eggs (hidden shortcuts and tricks) are turning different sites into gaming experiences, and players are uploading in-game videos of themselves playing on YouTube.

Here, we take a look at how the internet is taking classic games to the next level.

Playing online



There are entire cities of sites now dedicated to letting you play classic arcade games on your lunch break at work.

free80sarcade.com hosts Pac-Man (1980), Donkey Kong (1981), Street Fighter (1987), Zelda (1986), Super Mario Brothers (1985), Assault (1983) and hundreds of others, though you do need Adobe Flash Player installed.

The Internet Archive has also made a whole roster of games available to play for free, sorted by console. There are tons of games for the Coleco Colecovision, the Entex Adventure Vision, the Bandai Super Vision 8000 and most consoles you can think of.

The above sites are legal, but be careful when browsing around the web as some sites will fall foul of gaming emulator laws (especially if you're after recent games). Play the original Pac-Man in the box below.



Easter eggs online



There are loads of 'easter eggs' or hidden treats on the web that provide great fun for old school gamers. For instance, if you land on any video page in YouTube (it must be a video page, not the home page), type in '1980'. Not, in the search bar, just in the page. You should now find you can play Space Invaders above your video.

Another gaming easter egg from YouTube is when a video is playing or paused, hold down the left and up arrow keys – this should allow you to play Snake across the screen.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google's barrel roll and Atari Breakout easter eggs in action.

Google, of course, is famous for its interactive Google doodles. But the search engine also has a few tricks up its sleeve. Have a go at typing the following terms into the search box.

'Do a barrel roll'

'Atari breakout' (and then click on Images)

'zerg rush' (and play the game by clicking on the falling Os)

In-game videos



YouTube has always been a home for gaming aficionados to upload their game play tricks and tips – most football fans know the frustration of searching for live action footage and stumbling upon the second half of someone's FIFA tutorial. What's relatively new though, is people hooking up their old consoles and sharing the game play from classic titles, sparking nostalgia across the net.

And then there's the oldclassicgame channel on YouTube that allows you to watch game play of vintage video games, as far back as 1971. Classic Video Games, (below) features a number of old games from Game Boy, Atari 2600 and Playstation 2.

1179,"The powerful PSP changed the handheld gaming sector, but now Sony has ended shipments in Japan as well as the US

It was Ridge Racer that did it. The first time a lot of people saw that early Sony PSP title, they couldn't quite believe the clarity of the visuals – it genuinely was like having a console game in the palm of your hand. While Nintendo always makes beautiful little games that fit into the fun-sized format of its miniature machines, Sony's design goal with the PSP was literally to make the PlayStation portable.

Now PSP is saying goodbye. Shipments to the US ended this year, and they are closing in Japan soon. European stores will see their last arrivals toward Christmas. Launched in Japan in December 2004, it is almost 10 years old – not a bad achievement for a handheld that was almost written off early in its lifespan.

Not that there was anything wrong with the design. Sharp, stylish, mature, the PSP looked like a very different proposition to the child-friendly Game Boy and Nintendo DS machines. And with its 32bit architecture and 4.3-inch widescreen display, it wanted to be seen as something serious, something you could play epic action adventures and shooters on. Something cool.

The universal disc that no one wanted



There were mistakes early on. The device's properietary disc format – the Universal Media Disc (UMD) – wanted to be a sort of sequel to the mini-disc, a one-small-size-fits-all solution for games, movies and music. But it was clunky and expensive and with digital distrubution on the rise, it was never going to become a multimedia standard. Later, an attempt to cash in on the digitla market with the disc-free PSP Go failed due to a high retail price and the rather glaring lack of must-have downloadable games.



Third-party support was also patchy. The console struggled with high piracy levels of its titles, which meant the likes of EA, Activision and Ubisoft were reticent about committing to major development projects. However, the ease with which hackers were able to break the device's security system also meant that it became a favourite with the homebrew development scene, and amateur coders are still producing games and demos for the platform.

Some look back on the machine as a failure beside the all-conquering Nintendo DS, but this is unfair. The console sold 80m units, a figure boosted by a series of excellent hardware and featureset updates, including the slimmer PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 models.



And it had some wonderful games. The stylistically gorgeous Patapon, Every Extend Extra and Lumines 2; the epic Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker and God of War: Chains of Olympus; the eye-scorching WipEout Pulse. Perhaps most important though was Monster Hunter, Capcom's phenominally successful creature collection game that had huge gangs of Japanese school kids meeting up in parks to trade and fight monsters via local area network play. The publisher even opened a temporary gathering place for Monster Hunter fans in London.



The first second screen



Mostly, PSP changed the way people thought about handheld machines, in a way that Sega's Game Gear and Atari's Lynx had tried and failed. It brought home console visuals and game design approaches to the small screen; it wasn't a family plaything, it was a serious piece of consumer electronics kit. It could play movies and music, store photos, surf the web, get on Wi-Hi and ad-hoc networks – it hinted at a featureset that would eventually become habitual with smartphones.

It was also very serious about Remote Play – the idea of connecting game experiences between the portable console and the home machine. True, very few games actually ended up suporting the concept, but it hinted at an era in which ""second-screen"" entertainment would become a buzzword. It set in place the platform that would later allow the much smoother integration between PS4 and PS Vita.

So long PSP. We'll always have Half-Minute Hero, Tactics Ogre, Valkyria Chronicles II and GTA: Vice City Stories. They cannot take LittleBigPlanet or LocoRoco 2. They cannot take that moment of loading up the otherwise unexceptional Ridge Racer and seeing the cars zoom, not into a cartoon DS landscape, but into a gloating sun that cast its rays out among the deftly textured hillsides – much to the momentary astonishment of gamers everywhere.

1181,"Parents face an onslaught of complex demands from children who play games, but there are some simple rules to limit their exposure to violence

Video games offer experiences that reflect and draw from the full gamut of human experience. However, as with blockbuster films, many of the most popular titles fall within a narrower band and feature violence more frequently.

Chart-Track’s top selling games of 2013 are littered with severe descriptions in their age ratings: “extreme violence”, “multiple, motiveless killings”, “violence towards defenceless people” and violence that could be “upsetting to very young children”.



Although this can sound alarming, the top grossing films of 2013 also include a roughly comparable number of violence descriptors from the BBFC. The disparity comes with the number of popular games at the extreme end of this spectrum - half of the top 10 titles of 2013 included “extreme violence” only suitable for those 18 or over.

""Games deal with adult themes in the same way that films, television programmes and books do,"" says Do Jo Twist, CEO of the UK’s games industry trade body UKIE. ""The PEGI system gives an age rating and a content descriptor to help parents understand the content contained in any game and how appropriate it is for their children to play.”

The PEGI rating system helps inform parents' decisions

Games suitable for children over 3 or 7 years old have an advisory green PEGI badge. Games only suitable for children over 12 or 16 year old have an orange PEGI badge. Games for those over 18 year old have a red PEGI badge. The 12, 16 and 18 age limits are enforced by law at the point of sale.



The age rating is expanded upon by descriptors on the back of the box for Language, Drugs, Fear, Sex, Violence, Gambling and Discrimination. These signify a different severity depending on the related game’s PEGI age rating.

It’s at this level of detail that a full, and much less alarming, picture of violence in video-games can be seen. Many games have violence descriptors are for “implied” or “non-realistic” occurrences in 7+ and 12+ titles (556 in 2013) and fewer are labelled for the most “extreme” 18+ ratings (149 in 2013):

• PEGI 3+ games won’t have a violence descriptor but may contain “Tom and Jerry” slapstick violence if it is not considered disturbing.

• PEGI 7+ games flagged with a violence descriptor may include “non-realistic violence towards fantasy characters” or “implied violence”. (294 occurrences in 2013)

• PEGI 12+ will have the Violence descriptor to signpost “violence towards human like characters” but this must be non-realistic so that bodies don’t remain when killed. This may also include violent sports like boxing providing there is no blood. (262 occurrences in 2013)

• PEGI 16+ games are flagged for “violence towards human characters” who react to being shot as they would in real life. This will often include blood and bodies will remain once they are dead. (211 occurrences in 2013)

• PEGI 18+ games are flagged for including violence towards humans that may make you “wince” or your “stomach churn”. This includes gross depictions of heads, arms, and legs being removed by way of chain-saw or shotgun. It also includes sexual violence such as rape and mass killings of civilians. (149 occurrences in 2013)

This detailed account of video-game violence actually goes further than ratings for film or music, and dispels blanket concerns by clarifying who the violence is appropriate for. It enables parents to actively curate what is played in the home and avoid these choices being snap decisions.

Talk and about games - and play together

Once we have a clear understanding of video-game violence, attentions turn to its effect on young people. Measuring this is more difficult however because it varies from player to player. While many in the media quickly link playing violent games with violent behaviour the reality is not as clean cut.

We spoke to Andy Phippen, Professor of Social Responsibility in IT at Plymouth University. “Research is extremely patchy and inconclusive. Certainly from my own experience the vast majority of teenagers who play violent video games I have spoken with are well adjusted, likeable individuals who happen to like playing videos games.” However Phippen went on to reference the importance of using PEGI ratings because “some can be badly affected [scarred, nightmares, etc] by these things"".

Younger children will certainly be shocked by on-screen violence intended for adults, as suggested in the ratings. The effect on older players is more complex and needs to be distinguished from watching films or reading books containing similar scenes.

Although the graphics in video games edge closer to photo-realism, their interactive nature does more than simply intensify the experience of violence.

BBFC’s 2007 “Video Games Report” highlighted that being in control mitigates the player “losing themselves” in the violence because their suspension of disbelief is constantly interrupted by the need to take action. “The victims of violence [in video-games] have rarely been brought to life, no matter how realistic they may look; they do not have any stature – they are just a threat to the gamer and an obstacle to progress.”

Don't let consoles migrate to the bedroom

However, there are exceptions that use violence as more than a puzzle to be solved. Games like Shadow of the Colossus and The Last of Us work harder on context and character so that older players will find an emotional response to the loss, shock and sadness of violent scenes.

“On the whole young people can differentiate between video game violence and reality but where PEGI ratings and common sense is ignored alarm bells start to ring,"" said Phippen.

""I have concerns when I hear primary aged children playing games like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty. My advice would always be to check out the game prior to the child playing it to decide whether you feel it is appropriate.”



Unlike film and books, video-games are a new technology that we don’t yet fully understand, particularly in their potential for health or harm. That means that it is even more important for parents to accurately understand video game violence and the context in which it exists.

Playing games together as a family, stopping technology migrating to bedrooms, making use of PEGI ratings and having open conversations about these topics creates a healthy environment to maximise the enjoyment of this aspect of family life whilst avoiding potential pitfalls.

1183,"Customers are just as likely to click on natural search results as paid ads, a US study has found, raising questions about the efficacy of the multi-billion dollar search advertising market

Adverts in search engines have ""no measurable benefits"" to the advertiser, researchers at eBay claim in a paper published in conjunction with Berkeley and Chicago universities.

The auction site gave its own researcher Thomas Blakey, as well as Chicago's Chris Nosko and Berkeley's Steven Tadelis, the ability to experiment with how and when the company bought search adverts.

The researchers found that most search adverts on most search terms had very little affect on sales at all – and warn that the medium may be ""beyond the peak of its efficacy.""

Many companies buy adverts on searches for their brand. eBay, for instance, may buy adverts on searches for the term ""eBay"", as well as for terms such as ""eBay shoes"". But confirming what customers have long suspected, those adverts do little other than encourage users to click on the advert where they would otherwise have clicked on the normal search result to the same site.

""The results show that almost all of the forgone click traffic and attributed sales were captured by natural search,"" the researchers found.

""That is, substitution between paid and unpaid traffic was nearly complete. Shutting off paid search ads closed one (costly) path to a company's website but diverted traffic to natural search, which is free to the advertiser.""

Generic search results do better

The researchers had slightly better news for advertisers who buy space on search results for generic terms, such as ""memory"", ""cell phone"" or ""used gibson les paul"".

""Unlike branded search, where a firm's website is usually in the top organic search slot, organic placement for non-branded terms vary widely,"" meaning that a site can't guarantee it will show up on the front page for a search term unless it pays.

But the researchers wanted to test whether dropping off the front page for generic terms actually matters to sales.

Working with eBay, they stopped advertising entirely on non-branded search terms to 30% of the US for a period of 60 days, and found that it had ""a very small and statistically insignificant effect on sales… on average, US consumers do not shop more on eBay when they are exposed to paid search ads.""

eBay customers 'unaffected by the presence of paid search advertising'

Looking further, they found that the ads did have an affect on a subset of eBay users: those who had only just signed up for an account, or who had made fewer than three transactions.

""Consumers who have completed at least three eBay transactions in the year before our experiment are likely to be familiar with eBay's offerings and value proposition, and are unaffected by the presence of paid search advertising,"" they conclude.

The findings raise significant questions about the value of the search advertising market.

""Of the $31.7bn that was spent in the US in 2011 on internet advertising, estimates project that the top 10 spenders in this channel account for about $2.36bn… our study suggests that much of what is spent on internet advertising may be beyond the peak of its efficacy.""

Google is the biggest seller of search adverts in the world. In 2013, the company made $37bn from its various websites, a full two thirds of its gross revenue. The company doesn't break down revenue beyond that, but it is believed that the majority of its income comes from search advertising.

1185,"The Visual Arts Center in Austin, Texas, currently has a very unusual exhibit: a vintage girl's bedroom, perfectly preserved. There's a chunky monitor pegged to a Nintendo Entertainment System, all dove's breast gray and violet.

Pom poms decorate the television as a pink pinata slumps alongside; a pearly Polly Pocket toy, Judy Blume novels and posters depicting the romantic heroines from popular anime series Sailor Moon complete the picture. It's presented in the museum as a ""typical girl's room"" from the early 1990s. Also in the museum is another exhibit: a set of plastic digital Barbie game capsules under glass, hushed and precious. It looks like a priceless slice of history.

Except none of it's real, exactly. The little girl's room never happened. And the Barbie games are virtually worthless.

This is the art of Rachel Simone Weil, who has reimagined the nostalgic digital past as it might look if girly things had mattered then. A digital artist, programmer and rom-hacker, Weil found herself increasingly drawn to obsolete technology and collector culture – where she was surprised to learn that the traditionally feminine had no real value, financially or otherwise.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Game Room installation imagines that experiences of ""girls' games"" are valued as much as conventional classics like Mario

Nostalgia is somewhat obligatory for video game fans, who loyally subscribe to the iconography of 1UP mushrooms, blocky space invaders, neon power-ups and the wistful bleeps and bloops of Link and Mario. But rarely in that 1980s boy-hero vocabulary is there room for hearts, frills and dolls. While she liked computers and going to arcades to play Skee-Ball, Weil herself didn't have much interest in console games as a young child; the advertisements for the NES made it seem tough, competitive, and ‘for boys.’

""I remember different instances in my childhood of watching boys playing the NES, and feeling I couldn't interrupt,"" she reflects. ""I didn't have the courage to have a turn at the controller. I don't know what possessed me to behave that way, but I internalised this idea that girls didn’t play video games.""

Discarded icons



Once the games became vintage objects, the pressure was off. Nobody wanted a Sega Megadrive or a NES anymore; cartridges cost 49 cents. Little by little, Weil became passionate about collecting older games. She browsed dusty garage sales in fascination, at last with the full permission to touch, buy and try.

""When I was about 12 or 13, I got the internet for the first time, and I was able to go online and read about games that had never made it to the US from Japan,"" says Weil. ""They were really cutesy and girly, these Sailor Moon and Hello Kitty games. It opened up a whole new world for me – and this area of inquiry led me to ask other sorts of questions.""

She began hanging out in collector forums online, among other devotees of the obsolete who focused on cataloging and collecting old cartridges and logging and discussing every entry both grand and obscure in the history of video games. She fell in love with the cute, pink sensibilities of Kirby's Adventure, a well-regarded platformer where an adorable, marshmallow-like ghost sucks in and swallows objects in his environment.



Judy Blume books stacked up against a TV monitor and games console, with Mario peeking in the background

At the same time, Weil had begun hacking and emulating old games online, flexing a programming vocabulary which helped her learn to love old games and their palette swaps and sprite sheets even more; artifacts viewed from intimate angles.

But Weil remained interested in learning more about the Japanese girl-games about teen soldiers in sailor skirts, about the dollhouse oddities filigreed with princess crowns and Barbie branding. She wanted to know where to find them, and how much they might be worth. And when she asked the collector community about Barbie games, or princess games, she found they were not valued.

""That got me interested in researching more about these games,"" Weil says. ""Collectors were very dismissive of them, and I thought that was interesting.""

Weil soon realised the only way she was going to learn more about pretty, cute old video games was to collect them herself. She found vast amounts of missing or incorrect information online, and often there was a lack of interest or even outright derision regarding games about domesticity and girlhood.

In order to address this, she launched the Femicom Museum project in 2012, an ongoing catalog of the cute, pink and girly in obscure gaming history. Some of the museum's catalog lives on a massive shelf in her personal collection, others are digital listings maintained by Weil and contributors. In particular, the Japan-only games offer a uniquely fascinating space, where gender expression doesn't always map directly to the ways it's understood in the west. Often in Japan, games that look like they're aimed at women enjoy a majority-male audience.

When she borrowed imagery from those games for her audiovisual projects – chiptune music shows often feature handmade mashups of old game iconography by artists like Weil – audiences responded positively, but many would tell her they thought her aesthetic choices were ""funny"" or ""ironic."" She wondered why. When she included one of her personal flowery favorites, Kirby's Adventure, in the Femicom Museum collection, she received protests from male collectors who thought the action title didn't belong. How, they asked her, could something they enjoyed be thought of as feminine?

Weil's joyful embrace of corny 1980s fuschia girlhood seems, at a glance, to run counter to the most vocal feminist messaging about video games right now: that princesses are sexist, that pink is just cynical pandering that reinforces gender roles, and that such a binary history embarrasses the medium. Sometimes passionate feminism online forgets not to be legislative, forgets that there are plenty of girls who just like pink, or who want to wear tiaras, and that their agency and their experience deserves permission and respect.

""It’s a little challenging,"" Weil admits. ""I understand where this feminist critique is coming from, the concerns about stereotypes, but I think it's important not to erase girls’ and women's experiences, either. I think it's important we don't throw all these girly games and cultural artifacts in the trash and pretend they never happened. It’s part of a recurring theme, I think: works by or for women are so often deemed marginal or embarrassing or inadequate or inappropriate, and therefore omitted from history. And then decades later, we're wondering, ‘Where were the female writers, politicians, artists? Where were the girly games?’""

And game culture is so often interested in and entertained by the quirky, the ugly, the failures. Some collectors and historians are devoted to elements of games that were never quite finished or are legendarily rare (Ninja Turtles pretender Cheetahmen II is a favorite), or to famous legendarily awful or silly commercial busts.



Why shouldn't the awkwardness of a Barbie mermaid game get to join this circus of the strange? Especially in the modern age, as games that let players exploit glitches, record hilarious mistakes, and otherwise enjoy games in ways that weren't necessarily intended are subjects of popular visitation. One of Weil's old Barbie games lets players build their own short films, well ahead of its time.

""We can really give these games a cultural consideration that's more nuanced than, 'oh, it's pink, it definitely really sucks,'"" Weil says.

""I hope what will happen with the Femicom Museum is that boys and girls alike can look back at these historical games and interpret them in their own ways, in perhaps nontraditional ways,"" she adds. ""I'm interested in that sort of play: authenticity and truth and accuracy are things that, over time as a collector, I've become sort of wary of, and I think there's a lot of value in our ability to read new things into our past – and to make new things from it.""

Weil has even begun tucking her own hand-made interlopers into gaming's ""history"" – games that repurpose or simulate vintage graphics, games she might have wanted if they really had been available in her childhood. Recently, she did a subtle but striking hack of Capcom's classic Mega Man 2: ""The only thing I changed about the game is I replaced the typeface with the typeface from an NES Barbie game, which was just slightly curly and italic.""

Just a subtle change to such a lionised classic feels profoundly disruptive, even disturbing.

Taking a cue from old fortune-telling devices and Nintendo's old Game & Watch portable machines – the folding plastic cases of which were modeled after cosmetic compacts – and influenced by tacky teen-girl magazine horoscopes, Weil also created an NES game called Electronic Sweet N Fun Fortune Teller, which allows players to enter their birthday and blood type, and hiccups out a ""horoscope"" made out of glitchy sentence fragments. It also includes a love compatibility test, inspired by similar online tools such as the Love Calculator.

Sweet n Fun Fortune Teller is also part of Weil's exhibit at Austin's Visual Arts center, which posits an alternative, girly history for game culture, complete with narrational placards. The Barbie For Girls Portable Arcade Collection, six LCD handhelds still in their little blister packs, live in their fine museum glass vitrine, lit dramatically and treated as important historical artifacts.

""The reality is these games were purchased very, very inexpensively on eBay,"" Weil laughs. ""They're not considered to be collectible or valuable. What was really exciting to me was seeing, on the exhibit's opening night, younger girls and women who were just running over to the case and going, 'whoa, that's cool,'... something as simple as putting them in the case gave them value.""



Exhibition as criticism



These examinations of what does and does not have value – both monetary and cultural – in game history and collection is how Weil does videogame criticism. It's important to her that her work is additive, and comprises a critique that doesn't tear down or punish the legitimately sweet childhood memories of the world of video games that people hold dear.

""I'm hopeful that in this work, I can inspire people to think about other ways to do criticism, and one of those ways might be to create these utopias and reimagined histories,"" she says.



As gaming diversifies in the future, and includes more and broader experiences of race, gender, culture and class, it's fascinating to see in Weil's work an example of how it's possible to rewrite history so that underrepresented or undervalued fans may see themselves in it. Weil cites the 2010 addition of Kevin Keller to the Archie Comics universe – an openly gay young man in the Riverdale world of quaint 1950s Americana and letter-jacket masculinity – as another example of using an old, established aesthetic to reimagine the past and how it is remembered and valued today.

""I want to build something new,"" Weil enthuses.



It's worth wondering whether, in another 50 years, onlookers and researchers will even be able to tell the difference between true history and this type of surprising, subversive reimagination. Many things may have little to no value in gaming's history now, but what would the world look like if they had?

1187,"SecureDrop platform allows sources to submit documents and data while avoiding most common forms of online tracking

The Guardian has launched a secure platform for whistleblowers to securely submit confidential documents to the newspaper’s reporters.

The launch comes a year to the day since the Guardian posted the first of a series of NSA documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, sparking a worldwide debate on surveillance, privacy, and civil liberties.

Free speech and privacy groups alongside popular sites including Reddit, BoingBoing and Imgur, are marking the day with a Reset the Net campaign, encouraging internet users to take direct action to secure their privacy online. Several technology companies are also expected to announce new steps to protect users’ privacy over the course of the day.

The SecureDrop open-source whistleblowing platform provides a way for sources, who can choose to remain anonymous, to submit documents and data while avoiding virtually all of the most common forms of online tracking.

It makes use of well-known anonymising technology such as the Tor network and the Tails operating system, which was used by journalists working on the Snowden files.

The New Yorker, the US not-for-profit investigative newsroom ProPublica, and the Pierre Omidyar-backed startup The Intercept are among the newsrooms already making use of the SecureDrop system.

The SecureDrop platform was initially developed by the US developer and activist Aaron Swartz, who killed himself in 2013 when facing charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for the mass downloading of academic articles.

The platform was finished after Swartz’s death, and is now maintained and promoted by the not-for-profit Freedom of the Press Foundation.

Sources who wish to consider using the system to contact the Guardian can find information on how to use the SecureDrop platform at https://securedrop.theguardian.com.

“Protecting sources is at the core of journalism, and as the Guardian’s revelations from the Edward Snowden documents over the last year have shown, it’s getting ever more difficult,” said Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian.

“We’re pleased to be able to use the best technology available to make sure we’re doing everything we can to let sources talk to our journalists securely, and hope as many other outlets as possible do the same”

The Guardian’s SecureDrop system is installed outside of the UK. Last year, the UK government was criticized by international press freedom organisations for applying pressure to the Guardian over its publication of the NSA documents leaked by Snowden, leading to the news organization relocating its reporting on the files to the USA, and destroying all copies of the documents stored in its UK headquarters.

Trevor Timm, the director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the development of SecureDrop was part of a wider response to government crackdowns on journalists and whistleblowers in the US and across the world.

“In an age where governments are increasingly using surveillance to uncover sources and chill investigative journalism, technology can help whistleblowers and reporters safely get important stories to the public,” he said.

“SecureDrop is designed specifically for news organizations so they can receive tips and documents in a much more anonymous and secure way than email or phone calls.”

SecureDrop was given an extensive security audit by a team of cryptographers in July 2013, and updated in response to many of the concerns raised at the time. The system was also updated to address the widely reported Heartbleed security vulnerability.

While the system is far more secure than, for example, emailing information to a reporter, SecureDrop specifically does not promise 100% security.

“[A]ny organization or product that promises 100% security is not telling the truth,” says the Freedom of the Press Foundation website. “SecureDrop attempts to create [a] significantly more secure environment for sources to get information than exists through normal digital channels, but there are always risks.”

The steps taken by the system include secure browsing advice to potential sources, making use of the Tor network, which anonymises internet traffic by bouncing it through a series of intermediate computers, requiring “air-gapped” – a term mean disconnected from all networks – computers to open documents, and use of secure operating systems to analyse any documents.

The system also allows for secure two-way communication between sources and journalists after the initial contact is made, if the source so wishes.

1189,"The company's attempt to give mobile devices the ability to understand the layout of the real world will come to tablets as well as phones

Google's Project Tango, the company's attempt to give mobile devices the ability to understand the layout of the real world, will come to tablets as well as phones.

The company has revealed the development kit for the tablet version of the project. It's a 7"" tablet, the same form factor as the company's Nexus 7, but with vastly more powerful guts: NVIDIA's quad-core Tegra K1, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also has the all-important motion-tracking camera and integrated depth sensing.

Project Tango is run by Google's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) division, with the aim of making the most of depth sensors and 3D cameras to produce fully three-dimensional maps of interior spaces. It's akin to strapping Microsoft's Kinect to a phone, and then waving it around the room to build a map of the space it's in.

But although Google's provided developers with a slight hint as to the sort of thing they are expecting, suggesting that users ""could capture the dimensions of your home simply by walking around with your phone before you went furniture shopping"" or ""search for a product and see where the exact shelf is located in a super-store"", it's eager to give developers the chance to guide where the software goes.

As with Google Glass, wannabe early adopters can sign up for the chance to buy the Project Tango tablet when it goes on sale ""later this year"", for the round (if you're a developer) price of $1,024 (£608.50). It's already fairly close to shipping quality, according to Engadget's Brad Molen, who writes that ""the tablet actually looks like it could pass as a consumer device"".

1191,"Researcher claims that newly uncovered weakness could be used to directly spy on people's communications

More critical weaknesses have been uncovered in the OpenSSL web encryption standard, just two months after the disclosure of the notorious Heartbleed vulnerability affecting the same technology.

Tatsuya Hayashi, the researcher who found one of the critical bugs, told the Guardian that the latest flaw ""may be more dangerous than Heartbleed"" as it could be used to directly spy on people's communications.

Heartbleed was deemed to be one of the most critical internet vulnerabilities ever when it was uncovered in April. OpenSSL is supposed to protect people’s data with digital keys but has been exposed as flawed numerous times in recent months.

The latest vulnerability was introduced in 1998 and has been missed by both paid and volunteer developers working on the open-source project for 16 years.

Meanwhile, one of the other severe vulnerabilities in OpenSSL detailed this week was introduced by the same man responsible for the Heartbleed flaw, researchers said.



Using the vulnerability found by Hayashi, attackers sitting on the same network as a target, such as on the same public Wi-Fi network, could force weak encryption keys on connections between victims’ PCs and web servers.

With knowledge of those keys, the attacker could intercept data. They could even change the data being sent between the user and the website to trick the victim into handing over more sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. This is known as a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack.

“Under the public Wi-Fi network situations, attackers can very easily eavesdrop and make falsifications on encrypted communications,” Hayashi added. “Victims cannot detect any trace of the attacks.”

The vulnerability affects all PC and mobile software using OpenSSL prior to the latest version, believed to include the Chrome browser on Android phones, and servers running OpenSSL 1.0.1 and the beta version for 1.0.2.

Many website owners will be running OpenSSL 1.0.1 as it fixed the Heartbleed vulnerability. Fixes have been issued by the team managing OpenSSL, which encrypts people’s internet traffic going to and from millions of web services around the world.

Internet users running vulnerable versions have been urged to install the patches, as detailed on the OpenSSL advisory, which included fixes for range of other flaws.

One of those other vulnerabilities, which could have allowed an attacker to send malicious code to affected machines running OpenSSL and therefore have them leak data, was introduced by the same developer as Heartbleed, Robin Seggelmann, four years ago, according to an HP blog post.

The job of fixing the bug found by Hayashi is likely to be far bigger than Heartbleed, warned Nick Percoco, vice president of strategic services from security firm Rapid7.

“From a remediation standpoint it is actually worse for organisations running OpenSSL on the server side. Heartbleed only affected versions back about two years,"" he said.

""This issue goes back to the first release of OpenSSL in 1998. That means there were likely many people running version that were not affected by Heartbleed that didn’t patch last time.""

Many popular browsers appear to be safe from attack, however, noted Google security engineer Adam Langley, in another blog post. “Non-OpenSSL clients (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome on Desktop and iOS, Safari, etc) aren't affected. None the less, all OpenSSL users should be updating,” he said.

Prof Alan Woodward, security expert from the department of computing at the University of Surrey, said he wasn’t sure the bug was as bad as Heartbleed due to its constraints - for example, both the server and the client must be vulnerable at the time of the attack. But the flaw has been left open for so long and affects so many servers that it showed OpenSSL was heading towards its death as a reliable form of protection, he said.



“It’s been there all along since OpenSSL first launched and no one has found it before, which tells you something about how thoroughly these open-source tools are checked,” Woodward told the Guardian.



“It does seem like another nail in the coffin for OpenSSL. It may not be dead but this must be another blow to people’s confidence.”

1195,"Scam emails want your personal details and passwords, but there are some common-sense tips to stay safe

Phishing as a concept – scammy electronic communications trying to steal personal data and passwords – has been around for nearly 20 years, but people still regularly fall victim to it.

In June 2013, security firm Kaspersky Lab estimated that 37.3m people had encountered phishing attacks in the last year, including more than 1m people in the UK alone. Symantec, meanwhile, estimates that phishing accounted for one in 392 emails per day in 2013.

Phishing is all about convincing you to divulge information that could help criminals steal your money and/or install malware on your computer, potentially also selling your passwords on to others.



It works by impersonating communications from companies that you trust: banks, online payment firms like PayPal, social networks, online retailers and other technology companies, as well as government bodies (tax authorities, for example). According to Symantec, 71% of phishing attacks in 2013 were related to financial organisations.

A lot of phishing attacks are fended off without you ever seeing them, thanks to the spam filters used by companies and webmail providers. But for those that make it through to your inbox, there are some common-sense tips to ensure you don't fall victim.

If it looks wrong, it probably is wrong

Phishing often looks, well, fishy. Typos can be a sign that an email is dodgy – yes, The Guardian may be on thin ice with this point, but typos in an email from your bank really are a red flag – as are all-capitals in the email's subject and a few too many exclamation marks.

Check the email address carefully

If you often get emails from a particular company, they'll usually come from the same address – for example, the vast majority of my PayPal emails come from service@paypal.co.uk. Another address, especially one that looks strange, should raise suspicions.

Watch for impersonal introductions

Your bank, PayPal, Amazon etc know your name. A phisher sending out masses of emails doesn't. That's why real emails from these companies often address you by name. ""Dear Customer"" or variations on it may sound polite, but it's a definite warning sign, especially if the email is trying to get personal details from you.

Beware of threats and urgent deadlines

Sometimes a reputable company does need you to do something urgently – eBay was recently forced to ask its customers to change their passwords quickly after a cyberattack, for example. But usually, threats and urgency are a sign of phishing: if you're being asked to do something to prevent your account being shut down, or within a tight deadline, its cause for caution.

Don't fill in embedded forms

If an email comes with an embedded form for you to fill in personal details, financial data and/or login details, don't do it. Trustworthy companies will never ask you to do this in an email.

Be cautious about phone numbers and web links

If an email asks you to call a number to give your personal details over the phone, dig out some official correspondence from the company and use the number given there instead. And if you're asked to click on a link that looks legitimate, hover your mouse over it to see if you're actually being sent to a different site – don't click on it if so.

Beware of spear phishing

The advice above is for traditional email-based phishing attacks, which target a large number of people and hope that a few will fall victim. But in recent years, a new variant has emerged called spear phishing, which is much more personal.

Spear phishing targets individuals: instead of ""Dear Customer"" an email might address you by name, refer to a recent transaction you've made and/or draw on other information that you've shared online – often on social networks.

Spear phishers may even impersonate one of your friends, asking for a password which – if you share it – can then be tested on a range of other sites to see if the criminal can gain access to your accounts.

Most advice on avoiding spear phishing involves urging you to be more careful on social networks: the kind of ""could this information be useful to a cyber criminal"" caution that may not come naturally when tapping out a tweet or Facebook status update.

Even so, it's important – for plenty of reasons beyond spear phishing – to be familiar with privacy controls on sites like Facebook, so you know when something is being published to your friends only rather than the wider world.

It's also important – even though it may seem onerous – to use different passwords for the various retailers, financial services and social networks that you use regularly. Spear phishers thrive on the kind of password laziness that comes naturally to many internet users.

As for spear phishing that seems to come from a friend or known work contact, the same rules apply as for phone numbers in regular phishing emails. If someone you trust seems to be asking for a password, ring them up and ask if it's really them.

Don't think phishing is just about email

Phishing may be closely identified with email, but that's not the only way phishing attacks happen. In fact, that Kaspersky report in June 2013 claimed that only 12% of registered phishing attacks were launched through spam emails.

The rest came from fake websites, instant messaging software and other channels. Whatever you're doing on a computing device, be alert when seemingly-trustworthy companies or contacts are trying to get you to divulge any data that could compromise your online security.

1197,"Exploring the proud history of educational board games, Alex Hern is charmed by Class Struggle - which uses the roll of the dice to explain the dilemma of workers, capitalists and revolution

Terrible educational board games are a blight on us all. Everyone's played them: invariably, the game itself is little more than a reskinned snakes-and-ladders, but rather than climbing ladders, informative captions combine learning with fun. In theory.

""Witches have prophesied that no man of woman born can kill you! Move forward three spaces.""

""Archduke Franz Ferdinand has been assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip. Move backwards five squares.""

""You've arrived in the uterus, but there's no egg to fertilise. Skip a turn.""

It's not hard to pin down why the games are so unfulfilling. For one, they're basically pure chance, to the extent that even an eight-year-old on a rainy Thursday afternoon can tell that nothing they do has any effect on the outcome. For another, the actual game has little to do with what it's professing to teach: you're all just rolling dice.

But sometimes, people go the extra mile, and it makes all the difference.

Class Struggle is a faintly ridiculous educational board game, created by the New York University politics professor Bertell Ollman in 1978. Its aim, according to the basic rules available on Ollman's site, is to teach students ""aged 8 to 80"" about Marxism. ""The object of the game is to win the revolution… ""

""Until then, classes – represented by different players – advance around the board, making and breaking alliances, and picking up strengths and weaknesses that determine the outcome of the elections and general strikes which occur along the way.""

The game is still not exactly fun, but it approaches its goal with such charm that it's hard not to be won over. Take the chance cards – a different deck for the workers and capitalists, representing random events in the game.

""You have just been laid off from work,"" reads one worker card. ""If you blame yourself, or foreign competition, or the Blacks, or Jews, move two spaces back. If you blame the capitalists, move two spaces ahead.""

""You are caught feeling sorry for the workers,"" says a capitalist card. ""Victory in class struggle comes to people who think about their own class. Miss two turns at the dice.""

Impressively, even the rules of the game serve to underscore the message it's trying to send. Take how the players decide who is to play as the capitalist:

""Individual players cannot choose their class,"" the rules state. ""In real life, this is usually determined by the kind of family into which one is born. In ""Class Struggle"" too it is chance that decides. Throw the genetic (or luck-of-birth) die, the one with the symbols on it, to see who plays what class.""

In the full rules (the game includes a ""basic"" and ""full"" rule book, as well as a booklet designed to expand on the lessons imparted within), the order that the players roll the luck of birth die is determined by their social privilege. The whiter, straighter and more male you are, the more chances you get to become the capitalist. Just like in real life!

In its own way, Class Struggle makes a good case for the advantages of using games, not just to teach, but also to persuade. Playing a game involves playing inside a rule-set devised by someone else. If those rules mimic the real world, they can embed simplifications which would never pass muster when laid out in a more straightforward manner.

Take Class Struggle's rule that only the capitalists can trigger nuclear war, never the workers or, in a subtler fashion, Sim City's modelling of crime (poverty makes crime, and police stop it).

The fans the game has won - which include libertarian economics blog Marginal Revolution - are drawn to it by the the charm and sensibility of a slightly eccentric professor from the 1970s. However gently persuasive its message and skillfully crafted its game dynamics, it seems unlikely to have won many people round to the cause of revolutionary marxism.

1199,"Apple surprised developers by unveiling a successor to Objective-C, the programming language used across the Apple ecosystem, but what are the benefits?

Apple took developers by surprise on Tuesday by announcing Swift, a new programming language for developing apps across Apple’s platforms.

Until now, most apps on Apple devices have been built using Objective-C, the language almost exclusively adopted by NeXT corporation years ago and subsequently by Apple.

Objective-C now seems to be on its way out, superseded by a language that looks to be ""safe, modern and powerful"", according to Apple’s engineering chief, Craig Federighi. But how powerful is this new language, and what difference will it make to the global community of developers building for Apple products.

What is Swift?

Swift is Apple’s new programming language, which has been in development for the past four years and which looks to replace Objective-C as the main language for app development on Apple’s platforms, OSX and iOS.

It’s a major departure from the syntax of Objective-C and takes a lot of cues from other languages, such as Haskell, C#, Ruby and Python, which Apple presumably hopes will make it appealing to bright young coders, keen on modern languages.

Although it’s a major departure, Apple have taken a lot of trouble to make the transition to Swift as painless as possible. It is fully binary compatible with existing Objective-C libraries and maintains a close relationship with the Cocoa frameworks.

That means that developers can introduce Swift into their apps at their own pace, by writing discrete modules that should seamlessly interoperate with their existing Objective-C code.

But I’m good at Objective-C. Am I a dinosaur?

Objective-C has been very useful for Apple because it has allowed them to maintain full control of of their entire technology stack and to adapt it by adding features over the years, such as Automatic Reference Counting.

Unfortunately, the language is rather stuck in the past – it's C, on steroids. Developers that use modern languages tend not to spend time on the minutiae of memory management or fixing bugs, due to referencing pointers to the wrong memory address. C is inherently unsafe in these terms and this is the primary thing that Swift is trying to fix.



Safety is good, but what else is new?

Apple has decided to prioritise language readability in this first release, although I imagine that may change as it gets more adoption – programmers tend to value short, concise code. But they have introduced a special type, the ""tuple"", which wraps a number of values into one, adding generics, closures and operator overloading. There are many features missing that are benefits of other languages, but Swift makes a convincing version one.

What are the other improvements around Objective-C?

Type Inference



In Swift there is no need to annotate variables with type information as the compiler can infer type based on the value a variable is being set to. Due to the dynamic nature of Objective-C, type is not truly known at compile time because methods may be added to existing classes, entirely new classes added or instance type changed all at runtime.

Type Safety

With Swift, the compiler can be more helpful in catching subtle type related bugs. As the compiler knows more about type in any method call, it can optimise certain call sites and jump directly to the implementation using C++ style vtable dispatch, rather than going through dynamic dispatch as in Objective-C. This enables smart optimisations that can make code run faster.

Control Flow

The humble switch statement has undergone a radical overhaul in Swift and can now match against ranges, list of elements, boolean expression, enums amongst others. It doesn’t fall through by default, and is further enhanced by Swift’s flexible pattern matching.

Optionals



An optional type is a type that might contain a value of a type. It allows you to more easily convert between types and avoid null checks. Optionals can be chained together to protect from exceptions when calling multiple methods or properties in a chain where one call might return “nil”.

Strings

Strings are now easier to deal with in Swift, with a cleaner syntax than Objective-C, eg: concatenate strings using “+=“.

Where next?

Apple have made a big step by introducing Swift, which has largely been well received by developers at WWDC. The real test will be the response from developers in the real world, and whether this change motivates non-Apple developers to migrate. Judging by the emphasis that Apple is putting on promoting this language (with lab sessions all day, every day at WWDC) they are betting on it being a success.

1201,"The grandfather of addictive puzzle gaming, Tetris, is 30 years old. Share your tetromino-related memories in our open thread

I can't remember life without Tetris. Those tetrominos have been invading my dreams since early childhood - falling, falling, forever falling. The game turns 30 years old today, and with it comes the realisation that it's been there for me for almost my entire conscious life.

When Nintendo, in their infinite wisdom, introduced multiplayer Tetris via their Game Boy and high-tech link cable technology, I was able to share my addiction with friends via the medium of emotionally demanding block combat. Nothing is more pleasing to a young mind than cluttering your opponent's screen with unruly blocks: creation leading to chaos and victory. It remains one of the most satisfying multi-player games ever made.

I've never bought any Tetris-related pop singles, won a Tetris world championship or written any Tetris fan-fiction. But it's always been there, as sure as background radiation.

Aged 11, I was hit by a car during a school trip to France. The rumour that immediately did the rounds was I had walked into the road, backwards, while playing Tetris on my Gameboy. Entirely untrue - apart from the bit about being hit by the car - but entirely plausible.

Last winter, I travelled with a friend to Mount Kōya in Japan, to stay with some young monks in their remote monastery, to learn about Shingon Buddhism. We went to bed early in our traditional Japanese room, as there was nothing else to do. All was peace and tranquility.

We ended up playing Tetris.

1203,"Row escalates between Virginia and ridesharing taxi disrupters as Uber fights cities, states and drivers across the globe

Transport services Uber and Lyft have been ordered to shut down their operations in Virginia, the US's 12th most populous state, in yet another tussle with authority for the internet-based companies.

The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issued cease-and-desist letters to the two companies. It joins a long line of cities and states in the US and elsewhere, including London, where Uber in particular has faced legal challenges to its operations, which connect drivers and would-be riders via an app. Opponents say it is running an unlicensed taxi service - but Uber describes itself as a ride-sharing service, as does Lyft.

The motoring authority in Virginia, which has 8.2 million residents, previously fined both Uber and Lyft more than $35,000 (£20,800), claiming they were operating without proper permits under Virginia’s passenger carrier laws, which the state says applies to ""any business that receives compensation to provide or facilitate transportation”.

“I am once again making clear that Uber must cease and desist operating in Viriginia until it obtains proper authority,” Richard Holcomb, commissioner of the Virginia DMV said in order sent to Uber on Thursday. Lyft was simultaneously sent the same letter.

“The DMV will issue civil penalties to Uber’s drivers that do not have authority to provide transportation for compensation,” Holcomb warned.

‘Uber’s operations are not ridesharing arrangements’

Uber, which has raised over $300m in venture capital, has long portrayed its business as being based on ride-sharing, and that it is simply “connecting riders to drivers”.

Uber approves drivers, and issues them with equipment in the form of an app. But they do not have in-car meters, which the company argues exempts it from taxi licensing laws. Riders choose a pickup point and destination; the driver takes them between the desired places, at which the rider leaves the car without paying the driver. Instead, Uber bills the rider, based on time and distance. Uber pays the driver.

However Holcomb says that Uber and Lyft must be licensed as a traditional taxi company.

“Uber’s operations are not ridesharing arrangements as defined in Virginia law because Uber receives compensation for its services,” said Holcomb.

But in a statement released to the Washington Post, Uber said: “Uber has been providing Virginians with safe, affordable and reliable transportation options for months and has continued to work in good faith with the DMV to create a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We look forward to continuing to work with the Virginia DMV to find a permanent home for ridesharing in the Commonwealth [of Virginia].”

Lyft said in a statement to the Washington Post: “We’ve reviewed state transportation codes and believe we are following the applicable rules. We’ll continue normal operations as we work to make policy progress.""

Fighting on many fronts

Virginia is not the first state or city in the US to take action against Uber and other app-based services. It has been banned in Portland, New Orleans and Miami. Houston, the US's fourth-largest city with 2.6m people and the biggest not to allow Uber, is currently in a battle with the company, which has started to operate in the city but only on a no-fee basis. Houston legislation currently prohibits the app-based services operating for profit, and politicians there have not been pleased with Uber's tactics.

Uber is also facing opposition in Maryland, with 5.2 million people, where the state’s chief public utility law judge said it must file an application to operate as a for-hire carrier – a traditional taxi company.

Outside the US Uber’s reception has been mixed. London’s cab drivers are currently in a row with the company and Transport for London (TfL) over what is and isn’t a taxi meter, which has been pushed to the high court.

Only London taxis can charge using a meter, but black-cab drivers claim Uber’s app - which tracks rides using GPS - is tantamount to a meter. TfL says it is not because the smartphone using the GPS is not physically attached to the cars.

The outcome at the high court will not only affect Uber’s London operations, but also its recently launched Manchester service.

Uber and Lyft had not responded to a Guardian request for comment by the time of publication.

1205,"When consumers have been promised powerful, life-changing new software, delays and postponed launches can be excruciating.

Mac OS X was first demonstrated under the code-name Rhapsody in 1997, yet version 1 release didn't arrive until a full four years later. Windows Vista was originally planned to ship in 2003, as a minor release between Windows XP and the true follow-up, but that release date slipped by three years.

However, both of those pale in comparison to ""Project Xanadu"", which was released without fanfare at an event at California's Chapman University in late April. Development on Xanadu began 54 years ago, in 1960, making it the most delayed software in history.

Xanadu's developer Ted Nelson is the man who coined the term ""hypertext"" to describe the clickable links that were created for his project: the word lives on most prominently as the ""ht"" in the internet abbreviation ""http"".

At its simplest, Xanadu lets users build documents that seamlessly embed the sources which they are linking back to, creating, in Nelson's words, ""an entire form of literature where links do not break as versions change; where documents may be closely compared side by side and closely annotated; where it is possible to see the origins of every quotation; and in which there is a valid copyright system - a literary, legal and business arrangement - for frictionless, non-negotiated quotation at any time and in any amount.""

The version released on the internet, named OpenXanadu, is a simple document created using quoted sections from eight other works, including the King James Bible and the Wikipedia page on Steady State Theory. Users navigate with the spacebar and arrow keys – the directions warn users ""don't touch the mouse!"" - and can skip between the original works and the finished document.

Superficially, it resembles the web itself, and that's no coincidence. At one point, Xanadu had potential to beat Tim Berners Lee to the invention of the world wide web. But the project carried on slipping, and the web got there first.

""The web trivialized this original Xanadu model,"" Nelson argued in 2004, ""vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking one-way links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use.""

Having missed the chance to be the web, Nelson now sees Xanadu as a potential replacement for formats that spend too much time trying to be like paper, and not enough time trying to be something new for the digital age.

""We screwed up in the 1980s, and missed our chance to be world wide hypertext (the web got that niche). However, we can still compete with PDF, which simulates paper, by showing text connections.""

In 1995 - with the project already 35 years in development - Wired's Gary Wolf profiled Nelson, painting a portrait of a man whose execution never caught up with his ideas. But those ideas themselves went on to become hugely influential.

""Out of Nelson's discombobulation was born one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century,"" Wolf wrote. ""And Xanadu's goals - a universal library, a global information index, and a computerised royalty system - were shared by many of the smartest programmers of the first hacker generation"".

Watch Dogs is a very easy target. It lumbers into view as the biggest and most heavily promoted Triple A title in a release window where its only rivals for attention are the new Wolfenstein game and maybe Murdered: Soul Suspect. No, Mario Kart 8 isn’t in competition here. Everyone with any sense is buying Mario Kart 8 anyway.

It’s not just the timing of its release that presents problems. Watch Dogs arrives creaking under the weight of two years' of hype. It was the belle of the E3 2012 ball. It was the first glimpse of next generation tech a year before either Sony or Microsoft had announced their new consoles. It was prescient, presenting a world where the electron and the switch had evolved to gift a backdoor to prying eyes and exploiters. Where the high-end gadgets we’ve all come to rely on have become liabilities and weapons.

But now that Watch Dogs has arrived, some of its sheen has been stripped away. The knives initially came out when a trailer released back in March showed the game’s graphics had been downgraded. The last couple of weeks of reviews haven’t helped. While many critics have been complimentary, there is the lingering sense that a game as hyped as Watch Dogs should blow minds with the same force as Darryl Revok in Scanners – and it simply hasn’t. There have even been accusations that its content is racist, sexist and misogynist.

Perhaps it’s an indication that we expect more from developers on this generation of hardware. Critical views have hardened. Aspects that were largely skirted over in reviews of games like Far Cry 3, Batman: Arkham City and Grand Theft Auto 5 may be in for shorter shrift as the gaming audience matures. About time too.



Lead character as dead-eyed sociopath



I confess, though, that my experience with Watch Dogs didn’t send me into fits of indignation. In open-world games I’m used to developers painting with broad strokes when it comes to narrative and characters. It’s what made keeping company with Trevor Philips in GTA 5 just about bearable. Aiden Pearce, the all-powerful hacker at the centre of Watch Dogs, isn’t as hateful as Trevor, but he’s initially rather bland - apart from his voice, which is a throat-shredding growl.

Over time, though it becomes quite clear that Pearce is a dead-eyed sociopath. He is out to avenge the murder of his niece and he pursues this goal with a commitment that is as disturbing as it is blinkered. It’s not just the trail of corpses he leaves behind him that makes him hard to identify with; at one point his sister – the mother of the child he’s seeking revenge for – begs him to let his quest go and to move on. He refuses and as a result, he throws her and her one surviving child into the firing line. Pearce is driven to such a degree that when the player runs over the odd civilian by mistake it doesn’t seem like behavior that would be out of place for the character.

The story that drives the action in Watch Dogs isn’t exactly groundbreaking, hitting the familiar beats – revenge, death, kidnapping - but it’s covered in quite a substantial amount of grit. The one aspect that saves it is that it eventually sets out the notion that the single-minded pursuit of something – especially something that involves criminal activities – has a rather heavy cost attached to it. Without going into spoiler territory, the denouement in Watch Dogs isn’t what you’d call a happy ending, and this seems fitting; after the misery, pain and violence Pearce has visited on both his enemies and loved ones, he doesn’t get to ride off into the sunset like so many other open-world protagonists.

On the way to his date with retribution, Pearce will hack, drive and shoot his way across the city of Chicago in a fashion that’ll also strike players as familiar. The feature that bestows Watch Dogs a sense of uniqueness is Pearce’s magical phone, which allows him to wreak chaos using the city’s operating system. Once players plough enough experience points in Pearce’s talent trees, they’ll be able to use his smartphone to steal cars, scramble traffic lights, raise bridges, deploy bollards and even send the odd manhole cover shooting up into the sky.

They’ll be able to help themselves to the details of the smartphones of the NPCs in his environment, reading text messages, listening in on phone calls and ripping bank account details – that last aspect comes in handy when the player’s low on funds and needs to buy some hardware. The smartphone also gives them a window into the personal details of the people around Pearce. Initially this feels like a nice touch, positing the player with the odd moral conundrum – do you rip off a woman who is down to her last farthing and clinically depressed? – but eventually it blurs into background noise.



Hacking and sneaking



Before the player is able to unleash the full capabilities of Pearce’s phone, they need to hack the local ctOS hub. There’s an open-ended quality to these encounters; players can charge in guns blazing, or they can opt to sneak in and out without using any bullets. In some instances, they’re able to dot through these facilities simply using the CCTV network. Once the hub’s hacked, new players will see the local ctOS towers in the area. Once those are hacked quests and missions open up on the map.

These range from missions that result in their own mini-narratives, to fetch quests, to criminal take downs, to augmented reality games. There’s also the opportunity to invade another player’s game and engage in a rather gripping game of cat-and-mouse where one hacks the other’s phone and tries to make off without getting killed. We were concerned this would fall apart on public servers, but aside from the reported troubles on the PC version, it holds up well and offers something very interesting and possibly indictative of where seamless interconnectivity is going.



There’s a wealth of activity for players to sink into in Watch Dogs, some of it innovative, some of it not. What there isn’t, sadly, is any overall comment on the real-world technological panopticon that Pearce uses to smite all and sundry. You could argue that it isn’t the job of developers to illuminate and educate when all they want to do is entertain. But given how forward-thinking Watch Dogs appeared to be when it first showed up on the radar, the fact that its most compelling hook is simply a useful tool is more than slightly disappointing.

That said, Watch Dogs is solidly entertaining and a lot of fun to play. And while it could’ve achieved true greatness if it had followed through on its most ambitious promises, it is still better than a lot of what’s been released this year. The hype seems already to be benefiting the sales figures. Everything about Watch Dogs tells us that we are all susceptible in the digital age.

1209,"Search engine considering alert at bottom of results pages to show links have been removed after landmark EU privacy ruling

Google is planning to flag up search results it has censored following a controversial ruling that allows European citizens the right to demand information on them be erased.

The search engine is considering placing an alert at the bottom of each page where it has removed links in the wake of the landmark ""right to be forgotten"" ruling last month.

The decision by Europe's highest court allows people living in Europe to ask for links to ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" material to be removed from search results, although it will still be available on the original web page.

Google has since been deluged with tens of thousands of requests from internet users to take down sensitive information on them since the ruling by the European court of justice (ECJ) on 13 May.

It is understood Google is planning to flag censored search results in a similar way to how it alerts users to takedown requests over copyright infringing material. For example, a Google search for ""Adele MP3"" shows that it has removed a number of results from that page after receiving complaints under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Google is also planning to include information about ""right to be forgotten"" removals in its biannual transparency report, which reveals the number of government requests worldwide to remove material from its search results.

Google said last Monday that it had so far received 41,000 requests to take down sensitive material from people in Europe since the landmark ruling, including a politician with a murky past, a convicted paedophile and a man who had attempted to murder his family and wanted to remove links about his crime. Google chief executive Larry Page has said that nearly a third of the 41,000 requests received related to a fraud or scram, one fifth concerned serious crime, and 12% are connected to child pornography arrests.

The search company, which launched an online form two weeks ago for people wanting to airbrush material about their past, does not have to comply with every request, but must consider whether removing information is in the public interest.

Google has set up an advisory committee to issue recommendations about where the boundaries of the public interest lie in the requests, made up of seven people including its executive chairman Eric Schmidt and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.

Wales has described the ECJ ruling as censorship and raised concerns that news organisations would be particularly affected because Google is the primary source through which internet users find information. In an interview with the technology site TechCrunch on this weekend, Wales said: ""I think the decision will have no impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions and make it more difficult to make real progress on privacy issues.

""In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no possibility of any defensible 'right' to censor what other people are saying.""

Google declined to comment.

Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, said: ""The fact that Google plans to add 'flags' to search links it has removed does nothing to tackle the fundamental problem with the 'right to be forgotten' ruling - which is the complete absence of legal oversight in this process.

""We remain deeply concerned about a ruling that opens the door to a censoring of the past without any proper checks and balances.""",Google search results may indicate 'right to be forgotten' censorship,http://www.theguardian.com,[Josh Halliday],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/8/1402233996320/Google-search-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=61530dedd9a4eb467857de501b3dda9e,2014-06-08 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/08/google-search-results-indicate-right-to-be-forgotten-censorship
1211,"Contemporaries of Google's self-driving car research team, the founder of Anki are using the same principles of artificial intelligence for a smart racing game

Imagine playing Mario Kart in the real world using miniature, artificially intelligent robotic cars with real personality and their own weapons.



Launching on Monday in the UK, the Anki Drive racing game was created by robotics experts using the same principles as Google's self-driving cars. One player can race others cars that control themselves, responding and adapting to the real player.

“It sits at the intersection of toys, video games and mobile devices,” Boris Sofman, co-founder and chief executive of Anki, told the Guardian.



“We wanted to kick off this new category of entertainment where we can programme a video game on top of physical characters in the real world for the first time.""

Anki Drive is an advanced slot car racing game that uses an artificial intelligence (AI) engine in its remote control - which is an app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.



But Anki Drive is much more than a toy. Sofman and Anki’s two other founders, Mark Palatucci and Hanns Tappeiner, are graduates from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where the startup was jump started in 2008 during their doctoral research projects into machine learning, AI, robotics and self-driving cars.

‘A situation that’s not vastly dissimilar to what Google is doing’

The technology is similar to Google's software for self-driving cars, which has to identify objects and entities in the real world. Beyond that, the mathematics and computing is very similar.

“We’re doing motion planning in a 2D space and thinking about the four-dimensional problem of lateral position, forward position, speed and time, to figure out how to sneak up behind you and use a weapon or ability to cause mischief, but it’s the same family of algorithms Google is using,"" said Sofman.

Sofman admits he is a fan of the classic Japanese racing game Mario Kart, which resonates in the Anki Drive game.

“It’s got this beauty, elegance and simplicity where you can pick it up and play easily and you only need about 30 seconds to figure out the rules of the game.”

‘Equivalent of driving down a motorway at 250 miles an hour’

The race cars themselves are deceptively powerful, with a 50MHz computer, a camera reading the track and two electric motors, one in each rear wheel.

The car senses and interprets the track 500 times a second, correcting and reacting to its changing position and relaying that information back to the smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Each car contains a computer, camera and two electric motors. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian

'Corax is like the jerk in the bunch, akin to Wolverine from X-Men'

Up to six cars can race on the track together. The robotic opponents know where the player is on the track and can react and adapt, thinking two or three seconds ahead to challenge the player. Each one has their own personality and style: some beat the player using weapons, others cut them up, while others just go faster.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cars on track. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian

“Corax is the most offensive and aggressive character in the game with extra weapons and fire power,"" said Sofman. ""He won’t let you control him until you’ve beaten him in combat and proven you’re worthy.”



Players can visit virtual garages to upgrade their cars or fit more powerful weapons, but have to pay for improvements by winning credits as they win races.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Upgrade your car to enhance its speed, agility or weapons system with points won from races. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian

The pairing of a hardware frame to a software-driven experience also allows the system to be upgraded rapidly without having to buy new components. Since launch in the US in October 2013, Anki has pushed out two major updates, one adding a new racing mode and another adding support for more personality, new cars and new tracks.

‘A vision to be ‘the’ consumer robotics company’

Anki Drive is the robotics startup’s first product, but the company has ambitions beyond racing games.

Anki is exploring using Drive and its robotics platform for education, allowing others to programme on top of the small robots. The company is working with Carnegie Mellon, using its founders’ alumni contacts. It is planning a software development kit, to allow players to send commands from Raspberry Pi computers and other devices.



“We have a broader vision to be ‘the’ consumer robotics company, not just on the hardware side but on the AI side,"" said Sofman. ""Robotics is just an extension of computer science, and when you have something that can sense the environment around it, the next stage is all software to bring it to life.""

1213,"Since its launch January 2013, Twitter's Vine smartphone app has been used to share a wide variety of up-to six-second looping videos. But never from space.

Now Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman has changed that, posting a video shot on the International Space Station (ISS).

""1st Vine from space! Single Earth orbit. Sun never sets flying parallel w/terminator line,"" he explained in the clip, which he posted over the weekend, sharing it on Vine and also with his 67.2k Twitter followers.

Wiseman has been tweeting photos regularly since beginning his stint on the ISS in late May: the latest use by Nasa staff of social media, in order to raise awareness of the agency's work.

Fellow astronaut Chris Hadfield had a viral hit in 2013 with a video of his cover version of David Bowie's Space Oddity, filmed on the ISS. It was recently made private on YouTube, after a one-year copyright licence ended.

Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover mission has also been a hit on Twitter, with 1.57m followers on the social network for tweets purportedly sent by the unmanned rover vehicle as it goes about its research.

1215,"Luxury online retailer Net-a-Porter has announced a new collection for the designer smartglasses which will go on sale in the US at the end of June

Luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter has announced it will sell a selection of a new limited edition Diane von Furstenberg Google Glass collection in the US, making Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter the first third-party retailer of the wearable tech item.



Can the designer who introduced the wrap dress into millions of women's wardrobes give Google Glass the style makeover it needs?

“I have always been fascinated by technology and as a brand, DVF embraces technology,” says von Furstenberg, commenting on the collaboration. “It is a very natural fit for us and we are delighted to be on the forefront with Glass.”



It's not von Furstenberg's first dalliance with the smartglasses. Glass made its catwalk debut during the American designer's spring/summer 2013 runway show in New York. Models strutted down the catwalk wearing Glass, recording video footage of the show, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin sat in the front row alongside the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker.

Neither is it the first time that Google has attempted to make Glass more stylish - although this is its first collaboration with a fashion designer. This year, it was announced that Google would be teaming up with Ray-Ban maker Luxottica, though the new styles would not be available until 2015.

This month, Net-a-Porter will start selling a limited number of the DVF Made for Glass optical and sunglass styles, consisting of five new frame designs and eight new shades. The full collection will go on sale on the Google Glass site. Meanwhile men will be able to choose from three styles within the Titanium collection, which will also go on sale on 23 June on Mr Porter.

But the styles don't come cheap. Prescription lenses from the premium collection will set you back $1,725 (£1,026) while sunglasses will cost $1,620 (£964). It was announced in May that a consumer version of Glass is expected to go on sale to the general public at the end of 2014 but fans in the US are able to buy a pair for $1,500.



“We are thrilled to offer Glass to our tech-savvy customers who are true leaders and innovators in style and lifestyle,” said Natalie Massenet, founder and chairman of the Net-a-Porter Group, who also expressed excitement in the online retailer bringing Google Glass to their US customers months ahead of the global consumer release.

1217,"The first four Halo games to be released on a single Blu-ray disc with enhanced Halo 2 Anniversary edition and live-action series from Ridley Scott – plus access to the Halo 5 beta

Microsoft has made a major announcement regarding its sci-fi first-person shooter series Halo – and it's not quite what fans were expecting.

While rumours suggested that a special Anniversary Edition of Halo 2 would be revealed at E3 this year, marking the tenth anniversary of the hugely successful sequel, Microsoft is, it seems, several gigantic leaps ahead of its fanbase. At its press conference in Los Angeles on Monday, the company instead announced the Master Chief Collection, a bumper Xbox One release containing every Halo title from Halo: Combat Evolved to Halo 4, all running in HD 1080p.

Along with the four games, the package will also include a live-action digital series produced by Ridley Scott, which fills in the story between Halo 4 and Halo 5. Furthermore, Purchasers will get access to a competitive multiplayer beta of Halo 5: Guardians, the latest instalment of the series, due in autumn 2015.

Set for release on 11 November, the entire collection is delivered on a single Blu-ray disc. All the original co-op, campaign and multiplayer modes will be included, which means gamers will have over 100 competitive multiplayer maps to fight on. Developer 343 Industries has also added that everything will run at 60 frames-per-second, with multiplayer maps taking advantage of dedicated servers.

""Each of the experiences is contained within a single unified user interface,"" said creative director, Frank O'Connor. ""It will allow you to select any of the levels from any of the games at any difficulty setting in single-player or co-op.

We also decided to curate, in a museum fashion, interesting takes on the gameplay. So if you want to play all the Warthog missions consecutively or in any order, that's a curated campaign playlist that you can select.""

Multiplayer is apparently handled in a similar way, allowing purchasers to play custom matches from any game and any mode. ""We've had to take unique approach to matchmaking,"" said O'Connor. ""When the maps and the modes come up, players will be able to vote on what they want to play. So if most people select Team Slayer from Halo 2, that will instantly launch, it's all completely seamless.""



Halo 2 remastered



The collection includes the Anniversary Edition of Halo 2, which has been augmented in a similar style to the re-release of Halo: Combat Evolved, complete with terminals to provide new backstory snippets. ""It will have two engines running simultaneously,"" said O'Connor. ""The original and the Xbox One version of that engine; and you can switch back and forth in the middle of a game, as you could in Halo Anniversary."" Meanwhile, the soundtrack has been re-recorded by the Skywalker Orchestra, and six maps have been re-designed and updated by original multiplayer designer Max Hoberman.

""I think the thing we're most excited about is our new live-action digital series, Halo: Nightfall,"" said studio manager Bonnie Ross. ""It introduces some new characters and a story that drops you off at the doorstep of Halo 5.It's a tool that allows us to show how the past and future of Halo are moving together.""



Halo fans will remember the previous live-action content, Halo: Forward Unto Dawn. ""This is aimilar in format but the scale is much bigger,"" said O'Connor. ""It's a standalone story, but it introduces a brand new character who's going to feature quite prominently in Halo 5 Guardians. It connects the stories in an interesting way, but it's also more engaged in the current Halo universe than Forward Unto Dawn, which was almost a historical piece, it was showing you the origins of the universe. This is a snapshot of what's happening right now.""

In May, Microsoft announced Halo 5: Guardians, which will take the multimillion selling sci-fi series into the next-gen console era. The new game features series hero Master Chief, an augmented super-solder who saves humanity from an alien aggressor, alone and disillusioned with his past.

The new collection is, according to O'Connor, specifically designed to bring gamers up to date with his journey. ""It's kind of a big ask to require players to follow one single storyline through three console transitions,"" he said. ""It's always been frustrating that you can't have the whole story in one place, so new players have an onboard point. But now you can play it how you want. Everything is unlocked.

""That's a huge amount of content. And everything is going to run at 60fps on dedicated servers, and at 1080p; it's higher fidelity across the board thanks to a number of polish passes we're taking on the graphics.""



According to Ross, fans will notice that not only have there visuals been enhanced, but there is also extra cinematic story content. ""Xbox One gives us the ability to create a cohesive, connected experience like we've never been able to before. There's a new prologue and epilogue that seeds the story up to Halo 5.

""We think this is a pivotal point in who MC is. If you pay much attention to the Hero's Journey, MC is really at the very start. He is the augmented hero, but he's also human - that's a story we're interested in. His past plays a critical role in his future, we wanted to think about how we could connect his past to the future. What he thought of his past may be different than what it really was.

Although the price wasn't confirmed during the event, Xbox spokesperson, Larry Hyrb later tweeted that the price will be $60 or £50.

1219,"It sounded like a mea culpa. Xbox boss Phil Spencer took to the stage at Microsoft's gigantic press conference, on the eve of the E3 video game show in Los Angeles, and told the thousands of attendees that this would all be about games.



Broadcast live over the internet to millions of viewers the world over, the message couldn't be more clear: last year's emphasis on the strength of the Xbox One as a multimedia and live TV platform was a mistake. This is a games machine that also does other stuff that no one here really wants to hear about.



At the end of a pummeling 90 minutes of game announcements and confirmations, Spencer took to the stage again and said, ""thank you for making your voice heard, thank you for helping us shape the future of the new Xbox."" Basically, it's what Microsoft has been saying for the last six months – we listened, we changed, now eat this.

So now that it's all about the games, what are the games actually like? Here are the key messages from the conference.

The big guns are firing



There were lots of huge Xbox console exclusives that we knew would figure highly, that did indeed, figure highly. There was a short Halo demo, showing Master Chief flying a space bomb into an enormous craft. There's a suggestion the player will also take control of another Spartan investigating the series hero – more on that later. There was also Forza Horizon 2, complete with day/night cycles ""dramatic"" weather, the new Lamborghini, and the ability to set up driver clubs. It's out on September 30.

We also had a very lush, vibrant Fable Legends demo, showing four playable characters battling through a lush woodland. The key innovation is a new Villain role, which allows one player to take on the role of a Dungeon Master, arranging enemy traps and attacks. Oh and there was a new digitally distributed instalment of the Dance Central series, Dance Central Spotlight, which boasts a new technology allowing the game to feature new tracks much faster.

The most surprising exclusive, perhaps, was the new title from Japanese studio Platinum Games, responsible for Vanquish and Bayonetta, and now Scalebound, which appears to be a game about a dudebro who fights giant monsters while wearing fashionable headphones – although Observer writer Matt Kamen said, ""it looks like a cross between Panzer Dragoon and Devil May Cry, and there is nothing wrong in that sentence"". And heck this is Platinum Games!



Xbox One exclusive content

To back up its own brands, Microsoft also employed the familiar tactic of securing timed downloadable content exclusives on key multi-platform releases. It looks like the Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare maps will hit Xbox One first, and both Dragon Age: Inquisition and Tom Clancy's The Division will have unspecified DLC content available on the Microsoft machine before PS3. In an interesting twist, the next game from Playdead, the creator of atmospheric platformer Limbo will appear first on Xbox One. Named Inside, the project looks to be another fascinatingly moribund endeavour, set in a dark Orwellian world of traipsing monochrome men trapped in a vast retro-futuristic edifice.



Voices from the past

There were some big retro treats for longtime Xbox fans. First, Dave Jones, founder of DMA design and Real-Time Worlds, made a surprise appearance to announce that his new studio is working on a re-boot of Crackdown. The cult open-world adventure will retain its stylised look with rich cell-shaded visuals, and a city that looks like it's constructed entirely out of '80s neon night club signs. Also, as the E3 demo showed one character driving a giant fuel tanker bomb into a building, bringing it crashing down in a super nova of fire, it seems there will be no attempt to add subtlty to the series. Thank goodness. No firm release date yet.

We're also going to see a return of Xbox title Phantom Dust, a card-based action strategy romp developed for the original Xbox by Panzer Dragoon creator, Yukio Futatsugi. With its emphasis on building decks of weapons and items, it's a timely return, considering the growing fandom around Heathstone and Netrunner. The project will be overseen by Ken Lobb, creative director on the Killer Instinct reboot.

As one last little retro nod, Rare's much-loved squirrel character Conker will be available in Project Spark, the game creation package. Which means you'll be able to make your own Conker's Other Bad Day.



Developers are getting the hang of this next-gen console business

The first wave of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 titles were hamstrung by cross-generational development regimes (supporting both the old PS3 and Xbox 360 as well as the new consoles) and the usual lack of experience on new platforms. But the demos and trailers shown this morning in LA hint that developers are getting into their stride. A dramatic sequence from Assassin's Creed: Unity, set in revolutionary France, revelled in the blood, guts and chaos of the era. Shoing off the new co-op gameplay it had two players running through the streets of paris, taking out soldiers, before starting a riot that ends in a marquis being beheaded. There are sword fights, revolting peasants and a severed head on a stick, it's eyes flickering horribly. Beautiful stuff.

Elsewhere a short sequence from the next Lara Croft game Rise of the Tomb Raider (due out Winter 2015) had the young archeologist speaking to a psychiatrist about the experiences of the first game, while flashing to a variety of action sequences. And though bludgeoningly familiar right now, the demo for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which showed a street battle in a Futuristic Korean city, has super detailed visuals, including generous use of smoke and particle effects and a giant walking tank. Which is nice.

There was a lot of colour too – in Sunset Overdrive, of course, but also Crackdown and Fable Legends. Colour is good.

Obligatory indie section is obligatory

Yeah, but there was some good stuff in Microsoft's blipvert run-through of indie titles – all coming to the console courtesy of the ID@Xbox programme, which seeks to help smaller studios make and distribute games on the platform. Among them was Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time, Hyper Light Drifter, Might No 9 from Comcept, Fenic Rage, Aztez and Threes, which is just about the only game on this whole article that my wife would recognise. Add in Below from Capy Games, Inside from Playdead and the haunting-looking Ori and the Bling Forest from Moon Studios, which was given a longer trailer and looked gloomily gorgeous and you have a decent line-up to face Sony's own inevitable onslaught.

Verdict

Phil Spencer promised games and he delivered lots and lots of games, some of them really rather beautiful to look at. It was a noisy, somewhat relentless event, that had some crowd-pleasers, some interesting smaller projects and a few glimpses at what the big publishers are pulling out of the development bag for the second wave of next-gen consoles (well, they're current-gen now, of course, but that is way too confusing). The fact that gamers knew they could expect a little Halo, some Forza and a smattering of Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, as well as one or two retro returnees, meant that the atmosphere at the cavernous Galen Center never quite reached fever pitch. Or maybe it just couldn't be heard abover the bellowing sound system which was turned up past eleven to ""apocalypse"".



Really, Microsoft did what it needed to do, it showed its core audience that it still loves them, and it has plenty of games with guns and swords and dragons, and you won't have to wave at the screen or shout ""Xbox: make it stop"". Microsoft had to seduce its fanbase all over again, and anyone outside of that demographic may have felt slightly overlooked or under-addressed. ""Indie"" definitely is a part of this vision, and there are snatches of real innovation, but for this E3, there's a feeling we need more than a glimpse at something new. We need original IP from the vast mega-studios that stretches these big, powerful machines, and stretches what we mean by games.

Or maybe that's just me.



Microsoft has done enough, easily enough. But in this explosive and unpredictable industry is enough really ever enough? Over to you, Sony.

1221,"Minecraft's creator, Notch, has revealed his newest commercial game (sort of), Cliffhorse, in the process giving cryptocurrency Dogecoin its biggest platform yet (sort of).

Cliffhorse gives players control of a horse on a cliff, and gives them a horse-sized ball to push around which uses the same skin as the horse. That's… pretty much it. It is a very silly game.

""The entire thing is a joke,"" explains Markus Persson, better known as Notch, the creator of Minecraft. ""It's about two hours of work in Unity, using standard and free assets. But maybe being a joke is ok?""

""The game started out with me hanging out in PewGeminiLive's livestream of a blind Skyrim playthrough, where I kept referring to the game as Cliffhorse because of the sometimes funny horse physics. People in the chat asked me to make that game, I said sure, and a couple of hours later, Cliffhorse was done. It's basically Big Rigs, but there's a ball, and you're a horse.""



But Notch, put the game on Twitter, he also asked users who want ""early access"" to the game to send him Dogecoin.

Markus Persson (@notch) Buy Cliffhorse ""early access"" by sending Dogecoin here DMbE53XpM3RR4cnHnVoTPZzjBUwHogdYBe then downloading here http://t.co/dBagZctq3w

""I was going to just release it to the people in the chat, but by the time the game was done, the stream had stopped,"" Notch said, ""so I made a joke about 'early access' and accepted payments through Dogecoin, a crypto currency that has a definite joking edge to it. All the things referenced are things I love, and things that take things a little less than serious.""



Gamers don't have to send Notch Dogecoin to play Cliffhorse, but enough people have that he has received more than $100 in donations – which makes it his first commercial game since Minecraft was released in 2009. It went on to sell more than 35m copies across all platforms.

""Somehow, my first commercial game after Minecraft ended up being Cliffhorse. Hopefully that will take some pressure off my next game,"" Notch added.

Taking voluntary donations for a joke game is hardly a killer role for Dogecoin, but it underlines its reputation as the fun cryptocurrency.

Unlike bitcoin, whose supporters are increasingly likely to be working for a Wall Street bank or preparing to declare themselves immune from the government, Dogecoin's fanbase seems to be mostly made up of people who like the idea of doing things like sponsoring a Nascar driver, sending the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the olympics, or just paying a video game developer a few cents for a ridiculous game about horses and cliffs.

1223,"It's an incongruous sight, some of Buckingham Palace's most opulent reception rooms playing host to the fastest-rising stars of the UK tech industry. But under an impressive chandelier and overlooking the palatial gardens, a modest table of wares is being nervously demonstrated by some of the team behind Raspberry Pi, the Cambridge-based mini-computer project.

Raspberry Pi has nearly sold 2m units, co-founder Eben Upton explains, outselling the BBC Micro, outselling the Amstrad and rapidly closing in on Clive Sinclair's iconic Spectrum computer.

""I've lost count of the number of people I've met in the tech industry who started out on a BBC,"" says the Duke of York, who's in a lively mood, getting hands-on with the tech demonstrations.

He appears fully versed with the Raspberry Pi already. ""What people are applying the Raspberry Pi to outstrips any of the things you intended it for, doesn't it?"" he says, surveying a table showing the mini-computers running a game of Minecraft and Space Bear – a computer-equipped teddy bear that relived Felix Baumgartner's near-space jump in August 2013.

More than 350 of the UK's most successful and most promising technologists have been invited to Buckingham Palace by the Queen and the Duke of York for Tech at the Palace. As a special treat, guests are allowed to keep their mobile phones with them so they can tweet about their power networking experience.

Some of this forward thinking might be down to the Duke of York himself, who appears very well versed in the handful of tech companies presenting here. He's promoting his own awards scheme launched in March, iDEA, which has set the ambitious target of providing one million young people with support and skills around digital entrepreneurship. Launched in March 2014, the scheme is oversubscribed in its trial phase, says the duke, with 1,000 young people signed up and a waiting list. Musician Will.I.Am, whom he met at a Royal Academy of Engineering event, is a launch partner, alongside the creators of the project the Nominet Trust.

Having recently ruled out a return to his role as special representative for trade and industry, what does the iDEA scheme mean to him? The shadow of the Duke of Edinburgh's own 58-year-old awards scheme looms large, but he quickly dismisses the suggestion that iDEA is any attempt to create the same kind of legacy.

""No, never. Imitation might be the greatest form of flattery, so I stole that from him freely,"" he said. ""But this is about giving young people the digital skills they need for the 21st century … I don't care if these young people come from Hackney, Harvard or Oxford – this is for anybody, just like the devices that are ubiquitous … This is not about me.""

In promoting British tech, the duke says he ""unashamedly"" pushes UK tech companies in the US, while telling them to make sure they come back. ""It's not wrong to compare ourselves to Silicon Valley but the ecosystems are different. The east coast of the US and London are where the financial capitals are, and the thought process around risk is about financial risk, not entrepreneurial risk."" Veteran investor Marc Andreessen, he says, told him that the UK must encourage its own ecosystem and let it grow organically.

In the realm of tech startups, almost anything and everything goes – an unorthodox industry that might well appeal to the Duke of York. Even iDEA he describes as operating like a startup. ""We have no idea where this is going or where all the pieces are going to come from,"" he says, gleefully. ""We are talking to government because they think we are, perhaps, a little further along in this journey than we actually are, but we want to come up with a solution.""

This could mean a collaboration between iDEA and the Government Digital Service, the government's award-winning digital design team, to build a site that can show off the achievements of iDEA's young people.

The significant cultural challenges of the digital age are not lost on the duke, who talks to the right to be forgotten case. ""The law around the postal service grew up very, very slowly, so legislation could keep up with it. But the internet has grown so fast that no legislator can keep up with it. It's going to be an ethics problem far more than a legislative problem, and though 99% of the world's population are ethical, you're going to have to find the very small minority and make sure they use [these services] wisely and correctly.""

And what of privacy and sharing data with companies who may not be ethical? ""You're asking the wrong person, because as a member of the royal family we have already given up our right to privacy, with you guys [the press] around,"" he said. ""It's something that's happening and people are going to have to get used to it.""

Some of the UK's smartest but lesser known technology companies were exhibiting their products, including Bristol OC Robotics, which manufacturers 'snake-arm robots' for work in confined, hazardous spaces including nuclear decommissioning, and Intelligent Textiles of Surrey, which is working with the US department of defence to develop uniforms that can heat the body, carry batteries or include body armour.

Annika Small, CEO of the Nominet Trust, had been battling to gain attention for social projects that use technology to help people and provide new skills. Its Task Squad project matches capable but inexperienced young people looking for work with small businesses who can offer short, paid assignments. Another project, Speakset, adds a video call feature to TV set top boxes which allows the elderly to speak to family, or to services including their GP.

""We have been trying to build support across the industry, in local businesses that play a key part, with both formal and informal educators and policy makers. We know that there is a real disconnect with today's curriculum, with kids who don't identify as entrepreneurs and often struggle in formal education,"" she said. ""We set a very ambitious target of getting one million young people building digital entrepreneurship skills, but we have to start with the things that interest them – music, fashion and games – and show them that it's not all about programming and coding. These are the arts and crafts of the 21st century."" It won't hurt that the steering committee for the iDEA scheme includes Will.I.Am, entrepreneur and model Lily Cole and Michael Acton Smith, founder of the globally successful Moshi Monsters game.

Eben Upton said the UK tech industry has a powerful base of high quality engineers and academic research, investment funding and business networks, but that the government could do more regionally.

""A lot of effort has been put into east London, but there is more that could be done to sustain the regional clusters we already have in Cambridge, Oxford and Bristol,"" he said. ""Those clusters of tech businesses feed into the local economies and are very powerful. ""Funding tech startups is what the venture capital firms are for. Instead the government should be funding the infrastructure network, around which startups will be built.""

1225,"The Turing test has been passed by a robot named Eugene. It may be time to pledge fealty to the machines

Programmers worldwide are preparing to welcome our new robot overlords, after the University of Reading reported on Sunday that a computer had passed the Turing test for the first time.

But what is the test? And why could it spell doom for us all?

The Turing Test?

Coined by computing pioneer Alan Turing in 1950, the Turing test was designed to be a rudimentary way of determining whether or not a computer counts as ""intelligent"".

The test, as Turing designed it, is carried out as a sort of imitation game. On one side of a computer screen sits a human judge, whose job is to chat to some mysterious interlocutors on the other side. Most of those interlocutors will be humans; one will be a chatbot, created for the sole purpose of tricking the judge into thinking that it is the real human.

On Sunday, for the first time in history, a machine succeeded in that goal.

Or a Turing test?

But it might be better to say that the chatbot, a Russian-designed programme called Eugene, passed a Turing test. Alan Turing's 1950 paper laid out the general idea of the test, and also laid out some specifics which he thought would be passed ""in about 50 years' time"": each judge has just five minutes to talk to each machine, and the machines passed if more than 30% of the judges thought that they were human. Those somewhat arbitrary, if historically faithful, rules were the ones followed by the University of Reading.

It remains impressive that Eugene had 33% of the judges ""he"" spoke to convinced of his humanity, but the robots still have a long way to go to pass the gold standard of modern Turing tests, using rules laid out in 1990 by the inventor Hugh Loebner. Those rules call for the computer and a human to have a 25-minute conversation with each of four separate judges. The machine only wins if it fools at least half the judges into thinking it's the human (though every year there is a ""bronze medal"" awarded to the machine that convinces the most judges).

The hardest Turing test described so far is one set up as part of a $20,000 bet between the futurologist Ray Kurzweil and the Lotus founder, Mitch Kapor. Kapor bet that no robot would pass the test before 2029, and the rules call for the challenger and three human foils to have two-hour conversations with each of three judges. The robot must convince two of the three judges that it is human, and be ranked as ""more human"" on average than at least two of the actual human competitors.

How do the robots win?

Turing test competitions have been held for more than 20 years, and the strategies the robots employ have changed over time. Where originally the stumbling blocks were simply understanding the questions asked by the judges, now the bigger challenge is in answering them in a human-like manner. In recent years, winners have started changing the subject, asking questions of the judges, and simulating moods and typos.

The big breakthrough behind Eugene, the University of Reading's winner, was in giving the robot the persona of a 13-year-old boy. ""Our main idea was that [Eugene] can claim that he knows anything, but his age also makes it perfectly reasonable that he doesn't know everything,"" said the robot's creator, Vladimir Veselov. It also makes affectations like misspellings look more plausible than they would coming from an ""adult"".

What does a conversation with Eugene look like?

Here's the transcript of a 2012 conversation with a judge which resulted in them picking Eugene over the human interlocutor on the other side of the screen:

[16:11:25] Judge: what music do you like? [16:11:32] Eugene: I like Eminem – because he doesn't have a thing to do with ""polite-correctness"". [16:11:46] Judge: OMG i love eminem, he's my favourite artist! [16:12:00] Eugene: I wonder what Eminem's nick mean. I associate it only with a word ""enema"". But he is a cool guy, I like his ""The Real Slim Shady"". [16:12:55] Judge: i know what his nick name means, his real name is Marshall Mathers. From the initials M&M phynetically sounding like Eminem. [16:13:06] Eugene: Eminem is a famous crapper. No, raper... ripper... Yeah, I mean - rapper. I like his ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"". [16:13:32] Judge: I like ""Hailies song"" [16:13:46] Eugene: Interesting tastes. I like science fiction books, by the way. Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live? [16:14:22] Judge: Epsom, home of the derby. yourself? [16:14:27] Eugene: My guinea pig says that name Derby sounds very nice. [16:14:41] Judge: i shopuld talk with him sometime [16:14:48] Eugene: I think you should take some typing lessons. Or just type more accurately. [16:15:04] Judge: that's very rude? [16:15:09] Eugene: Ummm... Frankly, I didn't get your question:-( [16:15:49] Judge: ""Ummm"" isnt a word. i think you need typing lessons [16:15:58] Eugene: My thoughts are same. By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?

At the time, Eugene passed 28% of such conversations. Two years on, that extra 5% has made all the difference.

Is it time to pledge allegiance to our new robot overlords?

Probably not. For one thing, winning a competition by pretending to be a child with gaping holes in their knowledge does not exactly reinforce the idea that machines are something to be scared of.

But moreover, chatbots are a fairly limited application of the sort of artificial intelligence which science-fiction authors have been imagining for decades. By having to pretend to be human, they are prevented from being more than human.

They still offer new problems and possibilities for the future, from automatic scambots which carry out phishing attacks to customer support algorithms that don't need to reveal that they aren't actually a person.

But really, these machines say more about us than them. ""You don’t write a program, you write a novel,"" explain Eugene's creators. ""You think up a life for your character from scratch – starting with childhood – endowing him with opinions, thoughts, fears, quirks."" When the best way to pretend to be human is to imitate our foibles and weaknesses as much as our strengths, the victors of Turing tests will continue to be the least scary output of artificial intelligence research.

1227,"A US security company claims that a hacker group based in People’s Liberation Army offices was responsible for the attacks

A Chinese hacker group thought to be based in People’s Liberation Army offices was responsible for attacks on US and European satellite companies, a security company has claimed.

The report comes just weeks after the US filed charges against five members of a cyber division thought to be working out of the same military organisation, known as Unit 61398, for alleged breaches of six US organisations.

The attacks, detailed on Monday, are said to be the work of Unit 61486, and primarily sought to steal trade secrets of private and public bodies operating in the satellite, aerospace and communication industries, according to US firm Crowdstrike.

Two separate sources familiar with the activities of the group, which is known as Putter Panda and has been operating since at least 2009, told the Guardian it had attacked companies within the UK.

It’s also believed Units 61486 and 61398, the latter also known as APT1, are closely linked. “We do track hundreds of threat actors and this group [Unit 61486] would be covered in our attribution – they are very close to APT1,” said Jason Steer, director of technology strategy at FireEye.

Putter Panda hackers sent emails to targets, attempting to lure them into clicking on attachments that promised information on upcoming conferences, the Crowdstrike researchers said. When the attachments were opened, bespoke malware known as remote access trojans would be surreptitiously downloaded on recipients’ systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office.

Crowdstrike went as far as to name Chen Ping, aka cpyy, as one of the main operators within Unit 61486, as he was named as the registrant of the internet domains used to manage the attacks. The company said it was not sure if that was cpyy’s real name.

Yet his operational security may not have been up to snuff, as researchers found various clues that linked him to the PLA. These included personal pictures posted across his internet accounts, including an “office” file that included images linked to PLA facilities in Shanghai, as well as what appeared to be photos from his dormitory room showing two PLA army officer peak hats.

The domains he was thought to have registered were linked to an address corresponding to the physical location of the Shanghai headquarters of Unit 61486, in the Zhabei district of Shanghai, the researchers said.

Another person was linked to the group, known as httpchen, who had claimed to be attending the School of Information Security Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a “recruiting ground for the PLA to find personnel for its cyber intelligence gathering units”, the Crowdstrike report read.

Unit 61486 is part of the PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD) Third Department, the primary intelligence collection and analysis group within China, Crowdstrike said, and supports China’s space surveillance network.

Such specific attribution could be incorrect. Security expert Jeffrey Carr said in a blog post the Crowdstrike attribution was not based on sufficient evidence, whilst Steer said it was “very hard to be able to state with 100% confidence that any group or individual is behind an attack just because of the ease at which it is able to make yourself look like someone else on the internet”.

Aviv Raff, CTO of security firm Seculert, which has been tracking the attacks since 2012, said he had also uncovered links to China, but could not prove they emanated from the PLA.

A separate report on Tuesday from security company FireEye suggests Chinese hackers are also using social media in their targeted attacks on critical infrastructure providers.

It detailed a case involving an unnamed energy company and a fake persona called Emily, a purported job applicant, which was used to contact an employee over social media in an attempt to gather information from the firm.

The resume sent by 'Emily' via email also included malware, which would install a backdoor on target computers to allow the hackers access. The attacks have been linked to a group called Clandestine Fox, which FireEye believes is based out of China.

Some sectors of the security industry and within government are calling on the US and others to apply more pressure on China to curb its digital espionage activity, which the Asian superpower denies ever carrying out.

“We believe that organisations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold China accountable until lasting change is achieved,” the CrowdStrike report read.

“Through widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every part of the globe.”

The Chinese Embassy in London had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The Chinese government has previously declared the US charges against its officials “ridiculous” and demanded that it rescind the indictments.

1229,"Music service Deezer was down for hours over the weekend, but the French music site assures users that personal information is safe

Paris-based music service Deezer reports that users' data is safe after it was taken down by a hacking attack over the weekend.

The site, a streaming music service that competes with companies such as Spotify, was hit by two distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Friday and Saturday.

""The first small attack was detected on Friday morning, but it did not impact the service,"" the company said in an email to users. ""On Saturday 7th June, at 4pm GMT a large scale attack via a botnet (a group of compromised computers controlled by the attacker) resulted in a downtime of several hours.""

While some DDoS attacks are aimed at forcing services to reveal personal data, Deezer says that the attack didn't target user information, and only affected whether or not the service was actually available.

The company says that users personal information ""has been, and will remain, completely secure"".

A DDoS attack involves sending requests from multiple computers – often tens of thousands are involved – to one server, in an effort to overwhelm it with traffic. Because of the low costs and lack of risk involved, such attacks are favoured by ""hacktivist"" groups.

You don't know where it is, you can't tell if the sounds are getting closer or further away. A shadow flickers past, and then an immense black shape. You don't want to look at it, you don't want to breathe. Then silence. Has it gone?

Suddenly, the whine of a hydraulic door opening and closing. There are muffled thuds, then silence again.

Has it gone?

Creative Assembly isn't messing about with Alien: Isolation. The demos the studio has shown so far – short claustrophobic cat-and-mouse sessions with a single xenomorph on a tiny space station – aren't mere interludes in a standard gung-ho bug hunt. Alien: Isolation really is an interactive approximation of Ridley Scott's original film. It really is focused and terrifying.

Just to re-cap, the action takes place 15 years after the movie Alien. A small space station named Sevastopol has picked up he flight recorder from the Nostromo, but now contact with the facility has been lost. Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen and now a Weyland Yutani employee, is part of the investigation party.

""Get out of the medical centre!""



The E3 demo starts with Amanda, entering the station's trashed and now largely deserted San Cristobal medical facility. A male voice crackles into life on her radio, telling her to get to a makeshift operations point – probably set up by her Weyalnd Yutani colleagues. Pressing the shoulder button brings up the motion tracker, which also highlights the direction toward each subsequent objective point; there's also a handy map accessible via the options button. These are vital resources.

In typical Alien style, the place is a warren of blind corridors and cluttered rooms, the striplights strobing, the darkness at times all-encompasing. There are operating theatres smeared with blood, and staff quarters littered with abandoned personal trinkets. There are dead bodies propped against walls, slick with viscera.



The set design is brilliantly reminiscent of the movie, a mixture of retro-futuristic interior design and grungy lived-in details. Some areas are lit only by flashing red lights, while others are in pitch blackness, requiring the use of the torch, which once switched on, will provide alert the alien to your whereabouts.



""It's coming, it's getting nearer…""



Make no mistake, the motion tracker is of central importance – it's your life line. Any movement is shown in the triangular distance display, but if the reading is coming from behind or to either side, the direction indicators flash, so you can quickly orientate yourself to the incoming threat. Knowing exactly where the alien is becomes an obsession; you can't kill it, no matter what weapons you're carrying. We start the demo with a pistol and soon find a flamethrower, but if the alien attacks, these will only buy you a few seconds to scramble away – evasion is always the preferable option.

Most rooms have hiding places. You can clamber into lockers, or under tables. If the xenomorph is near you have to stay out of its line of sight and remain totally silent. It is a hunter with keen AI-driven senses, it can distinguish between sounds, it can see you, and if it knows you're near, it won't go away.

This is stealth gaming taken to its spine-tingling extremes and the hide-and-wait mechanic provides moments of nerve-shredding tension. From beneath a bed or desk, you can hear the alien stomp past, you can see its feet, its curling, savagely pronged tail. If you get into a locker, it may even approach right up to the grill, at which point you'll get the option to hold your breath and push your back right up against the rear of the enclosure. It is terrifying.



The fear of giant space monsters



""The heart of horror is the fear of the unknown, that was one of the early challenges for us,"" says the game's creative lead, Al Hope. ""If you've watched the films you already know what this creature is so there are no surprises in that. We were always going to stay true to the original so we weren't going to start inventing different types of alien creature to throw something new at you.

""It all had to come back to creating an opponent that you couldn't predict. It meant that we couldn't script it, we couldn't pre-describe paths because, in order for it to feel intelligent, to feel like it's hunting you, then it has to just use its senses and let that drive its behaviours and drive the experience.""

In this demo, our first task is to get through a locked door into the rear portion of the medical facility. Progress requires a pass card, but that itself is locked in a cabinet and a code is needed - you'll have to stick around and search.



Alien crafting



Investigating the environment is a vital process anyway, thanks to the game's newly revealed crafting system. There are useful components everywhere from explosives, to ethanol, to bandages, and using a similar interface to The Last of Us, these can be crafted into a range of items, including medikits, molotov cocktails, flares and a noise maker, useful for distraction.

Once through into the new area, the demo's second big revelation becomes clear: there are other humans on Sevastopol. The voice on the radio describes them as looters – perhaps the same sort of roaming space scavengers that discovered Ripley at the start of Aliens. But these people are armed and scared. The voice warns us to stay away from them. So here's a new challenge; as well as the monster, you're also having to avoid small gangs of trigger happy survivors. If they spot you from a distance, they'll usually shout a warning for you to get away – stay in their sights, or leap out on them unexpectedly, and they'll open fire.

But these aren't standard FPS encounters; they're quick an brutal – and a couple of hits is all it takes to kill Amanda. Even if she survives, the noise of a firefight quickly attracts the alien. Shoot outs tend to be a really bad idea.

It's up to the player how to get past. Melee weapons are silent an effective, but you need to get close. Crouching behind abandoned gurneys and using the darkness for cover can work, but it is slow and nervy. Fortunately, the installation is riddled with under floor air ducts, which can be accessed in key locations, allowing you to bypass looter patrols completely. But you really don't want to meet the alien while crawling along in this total claustrophobic darkness.



Emergent cinematics



The beauty of the game is the emergent nature of each encounter. Through the combination of the explorable environment, smart AIs and plenty of improvised weapons, every player gets their own moments of cinematic action. After demo sessions, journalists are pouring out, hearts pounding, hands shaking, telling tales of the time they just – just – evaded the alien. My favourite moment is when I hide behind a trolley and lob the noise generator at two looters, hoping to distract them – instead the noise attracts the alien which makes short, bloody work of its human prey before scampering off, leaving me free to progress.

Alien Isolation also cleverly subverts some of the key evasion and stealth features of standard first-person games. There's a sprint option, which will get you to safe areas quickly, but running makes a lot of noise; your trainers squeaking on the polished floors (yeah, the alien can hear that), and you're more likely to crash into nearby objects. Similarly, you can peek around corners, but you don't remain invisible to the alien or other humans – they can see your head.

Near the end of the demo, we enter a large generator room where Amanda has to re-boot the system in order to open an escape door. Reconnecting the power has the side effect of releasing an android from some sort of recharge chamber – its a terrifying biomechanical being, a sort of malevolent crash test dummy with glowing eyes. Intriguingly, it's not a Weyland Yutani model, instead it's the work of Seegson Synthetics, a rival tech company introduced for the game.



If the clearly malfunctioning unit spots you, it gives lumbering chase, all the while calmly repeating reassurances and instructions - when it is close enough it tries to beat Amanda to death. Creative Assembly understands the original movie's dread of intelligent machines.



Shock and hacking



So the tension ramps up; a hacking mini-game is required to get into the system – it's all about replicating an onscreen pattern sequence with the correct icons. The door opens; Amanda races through. There are looters, there is darkness, there are abandoned gurneys littering the corridors, and the alien is close. Just as we're about to escape, the xenomorph looms up in front, and a portion of the corridor explodes. The screen blacks out.

It's pulverising stuff.

Is this how the whole game is going to work? At this frantic level of tension? Hope confirms there aren't going to be any mass colonial marine shoot-outs, but he also says it won't all be about sneaking around facing constant nerve-shredding tension.



""I don't think X number of hours of that is going to be particularly fun,"" he says. ""We can't make a game that's unrelentingly oppressive, and keep up that pressure, this game has to be about tension and release, you have to have those intense moments where you're dealing with everything, but then we have to give you the opportunity - even if it's very short - to breathe again, to loosen the grip and take stock before embarking back into the unknown.

""For me, the game is very much about the whole of the journey. The station itself is almost a character - it's very broken and physically dangerous and just navigating your way through it is kind of a puzzle so that occupies the player from moment to moment.""

Importantly, too, Hope confirms that the whole game takes place on Sevastopol. There aren't any jaunts onto nearby planets or other space craft. As he explains, ""One of the cool things about Alien is the pressure. In the vacuum of space, there is no easy way out. You're trapped. That was something I wanted the player to experience.""

We do, Al, we do.

1233,"It was the news everyone wanted and Nintendo needed to deliver: a new Zelda game for Wii U, harnessing the power and possibilities of the maligned console. And that's not all the company had in store

After a year of falling console sales and revenue losses, Nintendo may have just pulled itself from the brink of disaster. In a pre-E3 event, streamed across the web, it announced a new Legend of Zelda title, which will arrive in 2015. This was the news its fans wanted and its console – the struggling Wii U – desperately needed.



Press responses have already been overwhelmingly positive. It looks rather beautiful. Nintendo explained that the game, which was hinted at way back at E3 2011, will take an open-world approach, across a huge game world. Producer Eiji Aonuma explained that when the series moved from 2D visuals to 3D polygons, the landscapes had to become more linear due to technical constraints – this is why 2003 instalment, Wind Waker, was set on a series of islands that could be loaded individually into memory. But the new Wii U Legend of Zelda will be totally open and expansive.



In terms of art-style, it had a touch of cel-shading, although a slightly more grown-up, less cartoonish feel than, for example, Wind Waker. Series protagonist Link looks to be slightly older, perhaps even teenage, and in the trailer, we see him on horseback, galloping through an intricately realised landscape.



After the success of Mario Kart 8 and the promise of the forthcoming Super Smash Bros, this is what Nintendo needed to turn around its rather miserable year.



Continuing to push the buttons of legacy fans, the company also has legendary game designer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamato working on a new title in the legendary Star Fox series. Miyamoto himself introduced the project at an invite-only event on Sunday evening.



There were also announcements of other additions and spin-offs to a variety of key Nintendo classics.

President and CEO Satoru Iwata was forbidden from travelling to Los Angeles for E3 on doctor’s orders. But at least on the Tuesday of the huge video game exhibition – when it properly gets into its stride – Nintendo will get some much-needed love from the gaming public, as it opens its stand on the show floor. It seems that all is not yet lost as far as the old stager of the games industry is concerned.

For now, here are the other key points from Nintendo's news announcements:



Miyamoto has been working on Star Fox

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto getting hands on with the new Star Fox

In a special event on Sunday, Miyamoto-san revealed that he had turned his not inconsiderable design talents to another classic Nintendo franchises: Star Fox.

Miyamoto’s theme for the event was concentrating on gameplay that could be derived from the unique nature of the Wii U’s GamePad – which has been worryingly absent from many of the console's games so far. He explained that: “On the TV, the view is similar to the traditional Star Fox view. But on the GamePad, you get a cockpit view, and you can aim anywhere using the motion controls.” Star Fox is, as ever, a flying-and-shooting game, and Miyamoto’s system worked beautifully when we tried it.

The Star Fox demo showed a game in its very early stages, albeit with plenty of original and fun gameplay – intriguingly, Miyamoto admitted that, having defined the core gameplay, he may enlist an outsider developer in a bid to get the game finished in a year’s time or thereabouts.



There were three different modes. The first, called Arwing, is classic Star Fox, and consists of an open-sky dogfight against many enemies; you can also land and transform into a tank. The second mode, Vs Wolf, is similar, but pits players against series rival Wolf O'Donnell, flying a similar ship to yours. The third, called City, put you in a helicopter flying over an urban landscape, with the GamePad screen showing a top-down view of what's below.

Miyamoto also showed two mini-games. The first, Giant Robot, being a sumo-like affair, in which players control the eponymous giant robot in a very odd manner – the motion-controls move his torso, the joysticks move his arms, and the player moves forwards or backwards using the triggers. The second game, called Project Guard, is an absolute riot. You are placed in charge of security for a building containing a maze, under assault from various types of robots. Your defences are a bank of security cameras armed with lasers that you aim using the GamePad’s motion controls – switching between cameras is vital, and it helps to have an audience telling you which camera to switch to.

Intriguingly, both mini-games were linked to the main Star Fox game, and it became obvious that they will form elements of it (an impression reinforced by cryptic comments from Miyamoto). If all the various elements are tied together coherently, Nintendo will have a truly distinctive game that really does make maximum use of the Wii U’s unique capabilities. Fans will hope Miyamoto can get it built as quickly as he suggests.

Amiibo: taking on Skylanders and Infinity

The Guardian was also invited to another event before E3 – a preview of Nintendo’s answer to Skylanders and Disney Infinity called Amiibo. This is a series of cute action figures which can be connected to forthcoming games, interacting with the onscreen activities. The first title to support the range will be Super Smash Brothers – but compatibility will also be retrofitted into Mario Kart 8. The Amiibo characters we saw included Mario, Samus, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, Peach, Kirby and Yoshi, plus a few unexpected additions such as the Wii Fit Trainer and a Villager from Animal Crossing.

You activate Amiibo by touching them on the Wii U’s GamePad, and in Super Smash Bros, they imported the characters they represented into the game – Nintendo explained that you could play with them, or use them as co-operative characters or sparring partners.



Amiibo characters in Super Smash Bros will be more powerful than the norm, and they support two-way communications, so that they can be upgraded or levelled up, with that data residing in the Amiibo itself. Turning the glorious canon of Nintendo characters into playable toys is an obvious concept, and long-overdue, but plenty of question marks remain. For example, we don’t know how they will be introduced to Mario Kart 8, nor whether they will receive their own dedicated game.

Super Smash Bros: the next big gun for the Wii U

Super Smash Bros, like Mario Kart 8, is a massively important game for the Wii U which should drive sales among veteran fans – although, alone, its debateable whether the popular multiplayer brawling game can lift the Wii U’s installed base far beyond its currently pitiful level – even with the added element of Amiibo support. But it looks vibrant and has all the frenzied single-player and online gameplay which fans of the franchise prize.

Ultimately, the 3DS version of the game could prove more significant in sales terms – it marks the first occasion in which Super Smash Bros has successfully made the leap to a handheld console, and Nintendo has lavished plenty of attention upon it, including a new mode called Smash Run which adds appeal to those who aren’t hardcore beat-em-up aficionados. Smash Run is a timed game which puts you in a platform game-like environment, studded with opponents, which give up attribute-enhancing power-ups when you defeat them.



We had a play-through and at the end of the session, even the lumbering Donkey Kong was jumping refreshingly huge distances and moving quickly, thanks to those augmentations.

Plenty of compelling new Wii U games in the works

Beyond Super Smash Bros, Nintendo showed a number of impressive-looking new Wii U games, many of which are scheduled for 2015, although if enough them arrive in time for Christmas, Nintendo could end the year on something approaching a high.



Yoshi’s Woolly World, in particular, was very appealing: it’s a Yoshi game, but in the tactile, homespun vein of Kirby’s Epic Yarn. This time around, Yoshi is three-dimensional and can unravel himself (and his surroundings) to get to otherwise inaccessible platform-style areas.

Familiar Nintendo character Captain Toad is also getting a starring vehicle of his own called Treasure Tracker, which resembles an expanded version of the popular Captain Toad levels from Super Mario 3D World.



It also turns out that Zelda fans will get a fix this year, but in an unusual setting: Hyrule Warriors is a collaboration between Nintendo and Tecmo Koei, in which the world of Zelda meets the gameplay of Dynasty Warriors.

Nintendo also revealed that Bayonetta 2, the sequel to the cult favourite brawler, will come with a free copy of the original game.

Splatoon was another stand-out title for the Wii U which proves that the console’s unique attributes can be harnessed to generate innovative gameplay. It’s an 8-player online game, pitting two teams of four against each other; players move around arenas, painting them in coloured ink sprayed from water-pistols, and can transform into squid to swim through their colour of ink. The team with the most territory at the end of each round wins. Splatoon, created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and something of a dream-team under Miyamoto’s wing, was exhilarating to play, and felt quite unlike any other game – which has always been the point behind the Wii U.

So Nintendo's current console is finally generating a solid games portfolio, that should appease fans and advertise the unique properties of the hardware. The question remains – is it too little, too late? And can Nintendo get its message across? The company’s future could depend on it doing just that.",Nintendo at E3: Zelda and Star Fox for Wii U a much-need shot in the arm,http://www.theguardian.com,[Steve Boxer],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/10/1402422934796/d132e15e-1799-49a7-9501-9362ba8089e2-1020x612.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=4b4495a69b5f953aa989ec7bead3b208,2014-06-10 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/10/e3-2014-nintendo-open-world-zelda-star-fox-yoshis-woolly-world
1235,"Social app will invite people to 'sling' annotated photos and videos to friends when it's officially released

If you can't beat 'em, try to buy 'em. And if you can't buy 'em, try to beat 'em again. That, in a nutshell, appears to be Facebook's approach to popular messaging app Snapchat.



The social network tried (and failed) to steal Snapchat's thunder with its own ephemeral-messaging app called Poke in December 2012, before reportedly trying (and failing) to buy Snapchat for $3bn a year later.

Plan C is an app called Slingshot, which was rumoured to be in development earlier this year. Those rumours were confirmed last night when Facebook ""accidentally"" launched it for iPhone in a number of countries.

The app was quickly pulled from the App Store, but not before sites including The Verge and TechCrunch had captured its promotional screenshots and marketing text, explaining how the app will work.

Slingshot is like Snapchat in that it gets people to share photos and video clips with friends, including features to scribble on the former before sending.

Twists include the ability for recipients to send a photo of their reaction back straight away, and also the requirement for them to ""unlock"" messages by sending their own in return.

""Slingshot lets you quickly share moments —little and big— with all your friends. Shoot a photo or video of what you’re up to and sling it to a bunch of people. They won’t be able to see your shot until they sling something back. Tap on a shot to react, or simply swipe it away.""

""Earlier today, we accidentally released a version of Slingshot, a new app we're working on,"" confirmed Facebook in a statement following first reports of the app's release.



""With Slingshot, you'll be able to share everyday moments with lots of people at once. It'll be ready soon and we're excited for you to try it out."" The company has not given a specific launch date.

Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has made no secret of his interest in Snapchat's growth.

""I think Snapchat is a super interesting privacy phenomenon because it creates a new kind of space to communicate which makes it so that things that people previously would not have been able to share, you now feel like you have a place to do so,"" he told an audience at Stanford university in January.

""I think that’s really important and that’s a big kind of innovation that we’re going to keep pushing on and keep trying to do more on and I think a lot of other companies will, too.""

Slingshot also fits into Facebook's evolving mobile strategy, based on more standalone apps for separate tasks, rather than the single Facebook app to do everything.

This is spearheaded by a division called Creative Labs, which is working on apps like news-reader Paper and now Slingshot. ""What we’re doing with Creative Labs is basically unbundling the big blue app,"" Zuckerberg told the New York Times in April.

""I think you’ll see a combination of us making some of these things that have been products for a while into first-class experiences. And you’ll see us exploring new areas that we felt we didn’t have the room to do before.""

1237,"New website promises advice on how to make pitches stand out from the crowd

Kickstarter has launched a new ""Creator Handbook"" in an effort to help more of its users successfully hit their crowdfunding targets.

Launched as part of the company's website, the handbook offers advice on first steps, what sort of rewards to offer buyers, feedback on the most efficient ways to market a project, and tips on fulfilment once it's funded.

The handbook appears to be inspired by YouTube's Creator Playbook, a regularly-updated online document explaining how people can build audiences on Google's video service.

""It’s your one-stop guide to designing a solid Kickstarter project, presenting it effectively, finding backers, and delivering on your plans,"" explained Kickstarter in a blog post announcing its handbook.

""It has insights and articles from Kickstarter veterans on how they pulled off successful campaigns. It has tips, tricks, and best practices on everything from making a project video to sorting out schedules, working with backers, and fulfilling rewards.""

The handbook's launch is part of a wider effort by Kickstarter to get more people launching successful projects on its service.

Earlier in June, the company announced that it had ""boiled down"" its rules into three key principles: ""Projects must create something to share with others. Projects must be honest and clearly presented. Projects cannot fundraise for charity, offer financial incentives, or involve prohibited items.""

It has also debuted a feature called ""Launch Now"" which enables people to launch Kickstarter projects without having to get feedback from one of the company's staff beforehand.

Since its launch in 2009, Kickstarter has generated nearly $1.2bn of pledges for projects, with more than 63,000 successfully funded.

Music is the most popular category in terms of funded projects, with more than 16,000 success stories. However, games is the most lucrative category, with $219m pledged for just over 1,300 successfully-funded projects.

Rivals include Indiegogo, which recently raised more than $40m in venture capital funding, and sector-specific sites like PledgeMusic for musicians, Unbound for authors and Distrify for filmmakers.

1239,"Publishing platform Medium has relaunched its subsidiary Matter as the focus of its publishing efforts, admitting for the first time that it is a publisher as well as a publishing platform.

The original version of Matter, a British science and technology journalism startup acquired by Medium in April 2013, has been quietly closed after the relaunch. Its former editor, Bobbie Johnson, previously a Guardian reporter, remains involved with the project and still works at Medium, but Matter will now be edited by Mark Lotto, formerly a senior editor at GQ.

Founded by the Twitter creator, Ev Williams, in August 2012, Medium has long confused commentators with its hybrid nature. While it resembles a blogging platform like Williams' first start-up, Blogger, it also commissions and publishes paid-for content. That led the tech CEO Jonathan Glick to coin the term ""platisher"" to describe firms like Medium.

Announcing the relaunch of Matter, Williams tried to ""clear things up"", under the heading ""Yes, we’re a publisher.""

""Medium is unquestionably a platform,"" he said. ""We have a top-notch product team working hard to make Medium the best place for people and organisations to publish their stories and ideas to the world. More than 10,000 were published just last week.

""One of the publishers on the platform is Medium, the company, as we have been from the beginning. Sometimes we find a writer we like who has a story we think should be told and commission them to tell it… The relaunch of Matter is our most ambitious publishing effort to date, but it’s likely not our last.""

Matter was formed after a successful Kickstarter campaign in March 2012, with the goal of launching a new journalism startup featuring readers paying directly for long-form reporting on technology and science. It was acquired by Medium in April 2013, and initially Matter founders Bobbie Johnson, a former Guardian and GigaOm journalist, and Jim Giles, formerly of New Scientist and Nature. ""We have no immediate plans to alter the team, the places we publish… or how much we charge for each article,"" they announced at the time.

Under Mark Lotto, Matter's focus will expand to cover topics ""from science and tech to pop culture and politics."" Lotto adds that ""what we’re doing is hard to explain: We’re not a news site, but we’ll cover the news, often, and in provocative and playful ways. We’re not another longform publisher, but we’re going to be publishing a lot of longform. We’re not going to be Wikipedia-broad, but we’re not going to be niche either.""

""Mostly, Matter is going to try stuff.""

GigaOm's Matthew Ingram praised the boldness, saying that ""while there’s a natural tendency to want to fit Medium into a specific kind of box, or to get it to answer the question of what it is once and for all… I think it’s sort of admirable that the site is experimenting with a bunch of different models – not just for finding or publishing content, but for compensating writers and tracking metrics around how that content engages readers.""

The relaunch of Matter follows an insight into the workings of the site from editor Arikia Millikan, whose LadyBits blog became one of the first high-profile collections on the Medium. Millikan described the experience of putting together a publication on the site as ""frustrating"", but said that ""what they are developing is still, sadly, leagues beyond almost every other online publication.""

1241,"In Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, war happens for the same reasons it always does: to exert power, to protect and expand territory. To make one’s mark on history. But the ways in which war is waged have changed beyond recognition.



Set 45 years into the future, soldiers wear exoskeletons which grant them superhuman strength, allowing them to carry great loads, to take lingering leaps into the air and to clamber up the side of buildings. Smart grenades hover in the air for a few seconds, pick out their targets before they launch toward them with a scream. Soldiers can switch between incendiary, flash and other types of grenade with a squeeze of the thumb. There are laser guns. Not only can soldiers flick a switch and become invisible: kilometre-wide digital canopies mask chemical warehouses from Google satellites’ prying lenses.

These visions are, according to Glen Schofield, one of the founders of Sledgehammer Games (the studio tasked with taking the Call of Duty series into the formula-freshening future) based in not in science fiction but reality. “Everything in the game is based on technology that we know will be out there,” he says. “It’s all based on research. The game is grounded in truth.”



It is, nevertheless, a speculative realism that is designed to make Call of Duty a more interesting, relevant game in 2014. Activision’s juggernaut series, released in annual instalments, boasts of being the highest grossing entertainment brand across all mediums. There is, however, a challenge for its wealthy custodians: how to maintain interest in a series that is becoming ever more familiar without alienating the gigantic fan-base (around 10 million players log in to play Call of Duty every day, more than six months after the most recent title’s release).

Being radical



The futuristic setting is Sledgehammer’s answer to the problem; the accompanying scope for new technologies in the game brings with it more than just a fresh setting – it changes the way in which participants play the game. This is, according to Schofield, “the most radical change to Call of Duty you’ve ever felt on the controller.”



It starts with the exoskeleton (dubbed the ""exo"" in game) and the raft of new interactions that it brings. There’s the ""exo climb"", the ""exo push"", the boost jump, magnetic gloves, the ability to hover… all moves that transform Private Mitchell, the game’s protagonist whom players follow from green private across a decade-long storyline to hardened veteran.



With the suit Mitchell can pull the doors from cars and use them as impromptu shields. He can cloak himself to blend in with foliage and become invisible to enemy soldiers (but not, crucially, seeker drones, which can see through the electromagnetic fakery). He can push an upturned ice cream van down the street to provide cover for his allies. In Call of Duty the protagonists have always been one-man armies who triumph against overwhelming odds. Here, the subtext is made explicit: you play a superhero.

Taking a sledgehammer to Call of Duty



This is the first time that Sledgehammer has taken control of Activision’s flagship series – and the publisher’s investment is clear: the team has had a three year development cycle for what was once intended to be a revitalising reimagining of the series. The senior members of staff at are best known for their work on Dead Space, a Ridley Scott-esque space horror series.



Advanced Warfare bears some familial resemblance: there is almost no HUD on screen. Your ammunition count is displayed on the gun itself, removing screen clutter. You’re also awarded points for how you perform in a stage (although these are currently not displayed on screen) and you can allocate these points into upgrading different aspects of you suit – faster running, quicker reloads and so on – allowing for customisation that is entirely new to Call of Duty’s single player campaign. Schofield estimates that players will need to play through the game two and a half times in order to fully upgrade Mitchell’s abilities.

There’s a renewed focus on storyline too, as evidenced by Kevin Spacey’s involvement as one of the key characters. This will be, according to Schofield, a story about “life, hope, friendship, pain and loss,” even if it is one that’s told primarily down the scope of a gun.

Reality, fantasy and war



Call of Duty has never been a series to offer solemn commentary on the nature of war. It is, rather, a reality built for spectacle and play. But as young British jihadists reference the series as they head to Syria to join in the civil war there, the futuristic setting and the fact that the enemy in the game is paramilitary group, rather than a nation state moves Advanced Soldier yet farther away from the perilous present toward something more remote, removed and, at least for the game’s PR teams, less controversial.

That spectacle rivals, as ever, the loudest Michael Bay blockbusters (one of the game’s scenes sees your character tear through a dark, abandoned, rain-pitted city while pursued by an attack helicopter; another ends with the grim destruction of the Golden Gate bridge). These scenes still have a certain, fleeting power and effect – even if we are deadened and wearied by the pornographic thrill of spectacular screen violence. But it's in the hands of players where Advanced Warfare manages to convince of its urgency and relevance. It is very much a game about now.

1243,"The great society-building sim returns, but the setting is now the hostile surface of an alien planet, and the old rules do not apply

The name of the game in the Civilization series has always been ""conquest"". While players build up their burgeoning society through research, farming, road-building and architectural endeavour, the core goal in each of Sid Meier’s great strategy games has been ultimately to subjugate the competition or leave them behind once the dust off to Alpha Centauri has been completed.

Sid Meier’s Civilization Beyond Earth doesn’t tinker really with this end goal. What it does do is toss players into an alien environment with a skills and a vastly different set of requirements for survival. They’ll still build units, cities, farms, and roads and conduct research, but the world around them will have a lot more of an immediate effect on how they progress.

The environment in Beyond Earth is hostile. Not only is it filled with pockets of ""miasma gas""– which peel health of any unit that ends a turn in them – it’s also dotted with alien hives that produce copious amounts of hostile xenomorphs. If the player’s city sits in close proximity to the hive, players will experience waves of attacks until it’s destroyed. This is an alien world – and it doesn’t like you.

Oribits and affinities



There are two big tweaks to the structure of the traditional Civilization template. The first is the addition of orbital platforms. Players can launch satellites to augment ground operations based on the amount of orbital coverage they have – and this is dictated by the size of their cities. Not only does this provide them with a useful tactical advantage, it also can lead them into conflict with the AI because as their cities grow, their coverage begins to overlap with their neighbours. This will prompt the AI to issue ultimatums and attack because the player is essential taking their aerial turf.

Second, political and governmental structures have been replaced with Affinity. This is a philosophical and political aesthetic that not only provides a governmental framework for each race, it also dictates what sort of units and buildings the player can construct.



There are three Affinities to choose from: Harmony, Purity and Supremacy. Harmony dictates that human society adapts and becomes a part of the alien world around it. Supremacy adheres to the ideology that humankind should evolve through technology and cybernetic augmentation. Purity does what it says on the tin – it rejects both other Affinity in the interests of maintaining the human state of evolution.

Depending on which Affinity players adopt for their society, the structures and units they build will take on a certain visual aesthetic. Supremacy cities will be filled with gleaming pillars of metal and glass, while Harmony structures take on a more organic and otherworldly appearance. Units, too, will copy the look and feel of their surroundings and, over time, will be endowed with abilities unique to each Affinity.



At high levels, for example, Harmony civilisations can summon up giant worms and bi-pedal beasts to squash their enemies while Purity societies can construct giant floating towers bristling to the nines with guns.

The politics and philosophies contained in Beyond Earth are great new additions from a mechanical and structural standpoint, but more than any game in this series, they strip away the polite veneer of diplomacy. Beyond Earth feels positively Darwinian and that’s fitting in a way; on a hostile alien world, only the strong survive and only the brutal thrive.","E3 2014: Civilization Beyond Earth – shock, awe and space war",http://www.theguardian.com,[Nick Cowen],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/11/1402482451347/269dd7dd-25ff-4c13-9222-4b31109e0d83-1020x612.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=f8280a61e1ccb795cd818fbb7c86ca52,2014-06-11 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/11/e3-2014-civilization-beyond-earth-shock
1245,"As a city, Los Angeles was built to look forward. During the 1950s its architecture took on a futuristic sheen, all swooping rocket ship angles, like a giant piece of concept art from The Jetsons. Now the buildings have a quaint nostalgic look – they are relics, and that is what a lot of people have come to desire. The future is kind of hard to face these days. Looking back is so much easier.

It's fitting then that this is where E3, the biggest show in video gaming should live. Because right now, the games industry is looking backwards too. Although both Sony and Microsoft have launched shiny new consoles, that are selling well and doing okay, there is a lack of self-confidence about the way games are going. The traditional industry, with its multimillion dollar budgets and boxed games made by hundreds of people is in a quiet crisis. What do people want? These guys aren't sure anymore.

Witness Sony's pre-E3 press conference on Monday night. There were a few original announcements – a gothic chiller from Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki, entitled Bloodborne; a gruesome horror romp from Suda 51 and Grasshopper Manufacture; something fresh and beautiful from the art director of Journey in the form of undersea odyssey, Abzu. But the revelations that got everyone cheering were the ones that looked back.

Grim Fandango, a cult PC adventure from the 1990s is returning, courtesy of its much-loved creator, Tim Schafer. The game, a joyous, clever and eccentric take on various afterlife myths, follows spiritual travel agent Manny Calavera whose job is to guide souls through the Land of the Dead. It is funny and eccentric, and it always threatened to come back. Many veteran gamers, who idolise Schafer and his colleagues at the old LucasArts development studio, are utterly overjoyed that it is happening. And that's great, really it is.

But Sony also leaned heavily on the announcement that Grand Theft Auto V is being remastered for next-gen consoles and the PC, and that the streaming games service PlayStation Now is to get hundreds of PS3 titles, as well as older classics from the PS1 and PS2 eras. Familiar, proven titles being repackaged and re-sold.

Something old, something borrowed…



At the Microsoft conference earlier in the day, some of the biggest cheers were for nostalgic rediscoveries – the Xbox title Phantom Dust is coming to Xbox One. Crackdown, the open-world adventure from 2007 is to get a reboot, with original designer Dave Jones (responsible for Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto) at the helm.



This is natural in a way. Games look back as well as forward, constantly re-purposing established genres and ideas for a new generation. Much of what we call innovation in the mainstream industry today is about combining familiar genres. The giant space opera Destiny, for example, which is on course to be the most expensive game ever made ($500m and counting), is essentially Bungie's Halo mixed with Gearbox's RPG-flavoured shooter, Borderlands. Meanwhile, long-running series' and sequels totally dominate the development landscape for what's left of the Triple A studios. Tomb Raider, Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed… these titles dominated the chatter from the press conference day at E3 2014. They have been there for years.



There is a wider malaise, perhaps. As William Goldman famously said about the movie business, nobody knows anything. And in an era of $100m game development budgets, not knowing anything is a super expensive and destructive way to exist. Add in the fact that smartphone games have ripped the established norms apart, introducing new business models and diluting the user-base, and you have the most challenging era since the great gaming crash of 1983.

Games publishers aren't sure what people want; they don't know who gamers are anymore. They have never been so unsure. Sequels were always the safe route, but now they have been codified into a factory-like production rota. Big publishers like Activision and EA rotate development teams on mega franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield to ensure regular iteration. And Ubisoft mass-produces game mechanics across its range, so that Far Cry, Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed share identical methods of progression and environmental unlocking. What the traditionalists have learned from the mobile industry is that iteration works – iteration is good. Try something and if it works, reproduce endlessly, if it doesn't, kill it. Kill it right now.

Video games and nostalgia



E3 is all about nostalgia really. The industry it represents - with boxed games and big old publishers – is a relic of another era. EA gets much of its revenue from selling digital goods and downloadable content now – games are actually adverts for the content to follow. A big announcement at Sony's press conference was that the PlayStation 4 would be able to easily handle free-to-play games and that dozens are already in development. You could almost see the tumbleweed blowing across the stage. Core gamers don't want to hear that. Core gamers, weirdly, cry for innovation then cheer loudest for old stuff they recognise. You know, when games were games and you paid once and they were yours forever.

As Philip Larkin once put it: ""Never such innocence again"". Grim Fandango speaks to us about another era in which clever people made games they wanted to make in small teams and they were funny and challenging, and you had to be good at them. Big games don't want you to master them anymore. They're desperate for your affection. They look at Candy Crush Saga and think, oh right, people want us to do the game for them now? Remember when Uncharted started to solve the puzzles for you if you struggled over them long enough? That's the future, guys, that's probably the future.

The industry is well into its digital age, but it hasn't worked out how to sell that vision. All the talk of cloud-based server infrastructures and seamless campaign multiplayer and second screen enetrtainment aren't chiming with anyone. The Wii U has tanked because a lot of people just don't get it. Just don't get why you need a personal screen - even though later that day they'll sit watching TV with a tablet on their lap. No games company has worked out how to communicate that three-way relationship yet.

It is no wonder Sony and Microsoft are crawling over each other to sign the indies. No wonder they're looking at the procedurally generated space game No Man's Sky and Capy Games' adventure Below with awe and wonder. These are innovations they understand - they're not about business models, they're not about new audiences who are hard to predict, they're about new ideas within the scope of traditional games. Indie developers are nostalgic but they have the freedom to take the mechanics forward and play with them, just as Tim schafer played with the idea of point-and-click adventures in the 1990s.



The industry of fear



All around the industry there is fear and loathing, simmering beneath the forced smiles of corporate optimism. Microsoft mis-read its core audience so badly last year it almost killed Xbox One before it was born – those guys are terrified.

New stuff will come, but it's almost like the industry has to rediscover itself through its past, a sort of purging reconnection with a time when everyone knew what they wanted – clever, challenging games that took you days of work to master.

Outside the E3 convention centre, the crumbling freeways buzz with life, carrying people though this city of lost dreams and curtailed ambitions. Los Angeles is the perfect place for the traditional games industry – a city built on a future that once seemed so appealing, so exciting, so tangible. People felt they could reach out and touch it. But the future isn't like that. It doesn't look like the Jetsons. It is a vast shadow looming over everything. And it has never seemed so hard to grasp.

1247,"""Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,

Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.

Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments

Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices

That, if I then had waked after long sleep,

Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,

The clouds methought would open, and show riches

Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked,

I cried to dream again.""

William Shakespeare, The Tempest

Nintendo games are about the ruthless and efficient production of joy. Every interactive system is designed and then tweaked by single-minded experts to wring out from the player a rising sense of pleasure. There is no escape; there is only submission. Whatever has gone wrong for Nintendo in the past two years, the doom-mongers have never been able to take that away. If you don't understand it, you'll never truly understand games.

And so after the triumphant announcement of fresh Zelda and Star Fox titles, came Nintendo's E3 showfloor collection. It is pretty delightful. Yoshi's Woolly World is a handicraft platformer that takes the aesthetics of Kirby's Epic Yarn and applies them to a saccharine co-op platformer, as rich, plump and delicious as homemade fruit cake. Here players control the cutesy dinosaur and friend as they travail worlds built out of stretches of felt and fluffy wool, discovering hidden passages and collecting items.

By hitting one button, Yoshi's tongue shoots out, which can either trap enemies, or it'll gobble up the other player character, allowing you to spit your pal at out-of-reach goodies or nearby foes – it can also be used to grab pieces of yarn, unravelling walls to reveal secret passageways. It's a familiar mechanic, harking back to the eat-and-shoot interplay in Bobble Bubble, but it's so wonderfully implemented and every animation is a delight.



Kirby's claymation kingdom



Kirby and the Rainbow Curse uses a similar hand-crafted 2D platformer look, but employs it in a different way. Here the lead character becomes a ball of modelling clay in a plasticine world, and players must guide him through increasingly tricky levels, by tapping the stylus on the screen to make him move, then drawing rainbow ropes across the screen to climb up on to higher platformers. Collecting 100 stars provides a boost which lets the malleable hero bash through denser obstacles and collect bonus items; there are spring boards to jump on and cannons to be shot out of.

There are also tank levels where Kirby becomes an armoured vehicle able to shoot enemies out of the sky while rolling relentlessly forward. On water stages, ropes must be drawn to keep the character submerged rather than bobbing to the surface. It's sickly sweet again, a gaming equivalent of a French Fancy, but underneath, the interface allows for subtle puzzles and delicate experimentation.



Toad in the role



The cute just keeps on giving. Captain Toad: Treasure Hunter is a compactly designed three-dimensional puzzler, in which the character from Super Mario 3D world gets his own dedicated outing. Moving the gamepad rotates each multi-levelled stage, allowing you to spot traps, bridges and secret areas, while avoiding enemies and hitting a button to dig beneath plants for special items. Patrolling baddies can be momentarily stopped by putting a finger over them on the Game Pad screen allowing you to scamper past.

It's all about studying and understanding a range of intricately constructed buildings and environments – sort of Mario meets Fez. I also got to try a mine cart level, where you speed along the tracks using the GamePad to aim at enemies and bonus items at which you fire turnips. It is fun. Always with the fun.

Lemmings on a suger rush



Then I played Mario v Donkey Kong, the Wii U version of the hit DS and 3DS series of Lemmings-like puzzlers. The gameplay is immediately familiar, guiding a group of clockwork Marios through a hazard littered environment by placing and removing girder bridges at key points. It's not innovative, it's not doing much that previous versions didn't do, but you still get sucked into its mechanic of satisfying pre-planning. You'll also be able to build your own levels using the construction tool.



Splat happy



And then the ridiculous Splatoon – a four-v-four team-based shooter, in which players have to paint as much of the area as possible in their side's colour before the timer runs out. As well as the messy paint cannon, you also get a mine that splatters enemies and sends your paint gushing all over the blast area, and a bazooka that takes out rival painters from afar.

The skill is in using the map on the GamePad screen to get to unpainted areas fast. Hitting the shoulder button in any area that's been painted allows the player to dip under the surface and zip along unnoticed. If there is paint on the walls, you can use this mechanic to get to higher areas, and there is real strategy involved in covering the most surface area, then defending converted sections.

The control method, which allows both the right analogue stick and the motion sensors in the GamePad to control the camera, takes some getting used to and is not perfectly exectured right now, but this is a truly compelling take on the arena battler.

All of these titles are coming to Wii U in the next year, all are stupidly adorable yet filled with challenge. Some people get so frustrated with Nintendo for not moving beyond its historic collection of characters and environments, but then, there is something to be said for continually manipulating and experimenting with familiarity. And elsewhere on the stand is Bayonetta 2, which I have yet to play, but which will look and feel very different to these titles.

Over the course of two hours on the E3 showfloor, I worked my way through these bright games, with their plump plasticine trees, their bobbing flowers, their bumbling enemies, and unselfconsciously enjoyed every moment. There are more innovative titles on display elsewhere – barely 50 yards away, the Microsoft and Sony stands are fileld with treasures like Ori and the Blind Forest and Hyper Light Drifter – but this is show is about Nintendo doing what Nintendo does: delivering surgical strikes of pleasure.

Amid the simulated gunfire and pounding rock music, how thrilling it is to find this oasis; how utterly like Nintendo to face misfortune and doubt, with child-like enthusiasm. As I was playing Kirby, the voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, sloped over and asked what I thought of the game, breaking out into voices from the games, enthusing over the titles he'd played. Sure, Nintendo probably employ him to do this, because his excitement and humour are infectious, and OMG, he's the voice of Mario! But this is the sort of thing that happens here.



Zelda and Starfox alone may not save Wii U, but it looks like there are understudies ready to help buoy up the machine. These games give delight and hurt not. When you stop playing, you awake from the dream, and you want to go back.

1249,"Nominet says that if you receive any compensation from your site, you're classed as a business and must have your home address made public

Since Tuesday, running a personal website has become a privacy minefield for people using .uk domain names. A recent rule change by Nominet, the company which manages the .uk registry, means that domain name owners whose home addresses were previously kept private may now be publicly visible in online searches. People setting up domain names through Nominet must now also show their full legal personal or business name on the public registration database.



Nominet was previously liberal in allowing individuals who had registered domain names to opt out of having their postal addresses shown in WHOIS search, but now a new broader policy is being strictly enforced. It reads, in part:



Only domain name holders who are ""non-trading individuals"" can opt out of having their address details published on the WHOIS. In other words, if the registrant is not a business or organisation and – in the case of domain names registered to individuals – you do not use or plan to use your domain name for business, trade (such as pay-per-click advertising, etc.) or professional transactions, you may opt out of having your address display

Andrew Norton, who blogs about politics and statistics on his website at ktetch.co.uk, fell foul of this new policy in May. Nominet raised its concerns with Norton about the content of his site - he includes the email discussion on his site - and shortly afterwards revealed his home address in the public WHOIS search while the matter was still being investigated.

Norton rented a PO Box address to use as his public address while Nominet wouldn't let him keep his details private; but the organisation has now recanted, and hidden them, presumably accepting that his site is - as he said all along - non-commercial.

Nominet’s treatment of Norton suggests that its definition of commercial and professional activity is broad and includes activities where no contracts are made or money changes hands between the website owner and their visitors.



In Norton’s case, Nominet was concerned that he included a link to Amazon for a book he’d written, a pay-per-click banner and a free email list subscription widget on his site. None of these involved Norton entering into contracts with his website visitors, nor directly receiving money from them. It’s very hard to see how any visitor to Norton’s site would be reassured to buy a book from Amazon, click a banner or sign up for a free newsletter by being able to obtain his home postal address.



Norton has made a complaint to the information commissioner over Nominet’s release of his private information.



As many internet businesses are strengthening their customers’ privacy features in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations it’s surprising to see Nominet moving in the other direction. But one clue might be in its use of language. In an email to Andrew Norton, a Nominet representative wrote:



To opt out, you must be a ‘consumer’ i.e. an individual who has registered and is using the domain name for a purpose unconnected with any business, trade (this includes the registration of domain names for monetisation purposes, e.g. pay per click advertising etc) or profession.

This unusual use of the word “consumer” suggests a binary view of the world: website owners are either businesses, or they’re customers. They’re either selling, or (potentially) buying. It’s either all business and professional content, or none at all.



But many people, Andrew Norton included, don’t fall neatly into one category or another. Many bloggers include affiliate links to related products or web hosting on their sites to try to offset their running costs but they’re not set up to be businesses or to turn a profit. And there are many professional people in full time employment who write about their profession or industry, sometimes pseudonymously. Would Nominet insist that the teacher or police officer who blogs on their own .uk domain must reveal their home address to the world?



On Twitter, the organisation has indicated that it won't be absolute.

Nominet (@Nominet) @adrianshort @jimmy_wales @ktetch 1/2 it is not our intention to apply policy over zealously & undermine privacy.

Nominet (@Nominet) @adrianshort @jimmy_wales @ktetch 2/2 We'll reconsider marginal cases & update approach

""It is not our intention to apply policy over zealously & undermine privacy,"" Nominet's official Twitter account tweeted on 6 June. ""We'll reconsider marginal cases and update [our] approach.""

In a statement to the Guardian, Nominet said:

""The WHOIS opt-out exists to protect consumer privacy when using UK domain names for your website and it is widely used. In fact over 2m of our 10.5m registrations have successfully opted out, so it is incorrect to draw the conclusion that our rules are prohibitively tight. You have to be an individual to qualify to opt out. Individuals can chose to opt out unless they are trading. ""However, we have always felt that when you traded with a website, you have a right to know who the proprietor is. Ensuring these registrants are “opted in” gives recourse in cases of fraud, missed delivery, etc., - and other things you’d expect of trading organisations – any consumer can look up the registrant of a website in the WHOIS and contact them if necessary.""

It added:

""Our policy on WHOIS opt-out has not changed in several years. However, we totally appreciate that since these rules were drawn up, the nature of trading online has changed – and there are some grey areas- such as affiliate marketing, pay-per-click etc. In many cases, the definition of what constitutes trading, and what a reasonable threshold is not absolute. We will review our guidelines and policy around privacy opt-outs, as we want a sensible approach that is sensitive to those who rightly wish to keep their details private, and fair to consumers who expect to know who they are dealing with. We will implement any changes we consider necessary.""

Even so, independent web publishers struggle to maintain their privacy and freedom of speech online and Nominet’s new rules could make .uk a hostile environment for them. Imagine that you want to run a site or blog that could be controversial. You’re not doing anything illegal, but you have perfectly good reasons to want to keep this activity separate from your professional or family life. You can choose to use a blogging network like WordPress.com or Blogger, or perhaps a social media site like Facebook or Tumblr. But then you’ll be bound by the complex and ever-shifting content and behaviour rules of those platforms. A more reliable approach, if you want to keep your site free from interference and maintain your privacy, would be to go IndieWeb style: register your own domain name and host your site somewhere that permits any legal content.



Take Brooke Magnanti, the writer who made her (pseudo) name with the sex work blog Belle de Jour.



Magnanti hosted (and still hosts) her site on Google-owned Blogger. But imagine if she’d decided to keep more control of her content by registering a .uk domain name and setting up her own web hosting. Under Nominet’s new rules this would be almost impossible. While Magnanti was careful to protect her legal identity and her working pseudonym, arguably a blog about her sex work experiences would itself be classed as commercial. Even if it weren’t, what would happen once she’d got her book deal and linked to the Amazon page for her pseudonymous book? If she were treated like Andrew Norton she’d not just be outed with her real name but her home address too. Is there room in .uk for current and future Belles du Jour?



In a hamfisted attempt to make .uk a safe space for businesses and their customers, Nominet is squeezing out the rich diversity of social, political, cultural and creative independent web publishers. Nominet insists that domain registrants use their legal names and now verifies registrations against the electoral roll – so forget about whistleblowers, critical insiders, dissidents and radical activists setting up on .uk. Yet it's a proviso that's only being applied online. In the UK there’s no general legal requirement to use your legal name or to stick to a single name, even when doing business and making contracts. Provided you’re not defrauding anyone, you could use a different pseudonym for every day of the week. Yet at the slightest whiff of anything Nominet considers to be commercial or professional - which with rules as broad and as vague as Nominet’s could be almost anything - your home address could be revealed to the world, even, as with Andrew Norton, while you’re appealing against their decision.

Of course it doesn’t need to be like this. Nominet could limit its strict rules on legal names and public addresses to websites that literally sell off the page. If I’ve got a link to Amazon, I’m not doing that, but Amazon is. A site that uses banner ads isn’t taking any cash from its visitors. At the same time, .uk could be a genuine haven for independent web publishers with something to say who’d like to take advantage of the UK’s relatively liberal laws on freedom of expression without having to sacrifice their privacy in the process.

Instead, Nominet has made .uk a virtual emirate: open for business, closed for anonymous dissent and diversity if it links to anywhere commercial. We know that anonymity and privacy are often prerequisites for genuine free speech. How dismal that UK citizens who want to speak freely online without being outed now have to virtually emigrate to an overseas jurisdiction such as the US-based .org registry.

As Nominet moves away from being a neutral registry and becomes effectively a regulator, it’s time to consider bringing it under statutory control, making its rules clear, its policymaking democratic and its actions transparent and accountable. Unless and until wiser heads prevail, if you value your privacy, stay away from .uk.

1251,"A ""cross-site scripting"" (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered on Twitter's Tweetdeck client, leaving millions of users open to account hijacking and more.

Twitter has shut down Tweetdeck while it fixes the problem, despite earlier promising that it had been fixed.

The normal Twitter web interface, and other apps such as Echofon which use Twitter's API, do not seem to be affected. Tweetdeck is aimed at professionals and provides a web- or app-based interface to Twitter with the ability to show multiple views of different searches and users.

TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) We've temporarily taken TweetDeck services down to assess today's earlier security issue. We'll update when services are back up.

The flaw leads to vulnerable versions of Tweetdeck (3.7.1-19002e5) running javascript code contained in tweets from other sites. Most attacks using the vulnerability are no more than irritations, opening warning dialogues on users' computers - though one version created a retweet of itself, and spread 38,000 times in two minutes, and another changed the font on Tweetdeck itself to Comic Sans.

The original advice offered by the official Tweetdeck account claimed that the flaw had been fixed, and that users should log out and back in to their accounts to get the update.

TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) A security issue that affected TweetDeck this morning has been fixed. Please log out of TweetDeck and log back in to fully apply the fix.

But others found that the flaw persisted, despite following the official advice.

Matt Rosoff (@MattRosoff) Welp. Logged out of Tweetdeck, logged back in, and got this: So clearly Twitter's ""fix"" does not work! pic.twitter.com/Sv7bpvaqfQ

""Logged out of Tweetdeck, logged back in, and got this,"" tweeted journalist Matt Rosoff, posting a picture of a harmless XSS exploit. ""So clearly Twitter's 'fix' does not work!""

Tweetdeck then acknowledged that the fault had not been fixed:

TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) We've temporarily taken TweetDeck services down to assess today's earlier security issue. We'll update when services are back up.

""We've temporarily taken TweetDeck services down to assess today's earlier security issue,"" it tweeted. ""We'll update when services are back up.""

Theoretically, such flaws can be used to take over accounts, post tweets, unfollow and follow people, and more.



Twitter itself suffered a similar vulnerability in September 2010 that proved embarrassing after it was discovered by an Australian teenager.

Tweetdeck was originally a British company, and was acquired by Twitter for about £25m ($40m) in May 2011.

1253,"The latest Angry Birds game still involves birds battling pigs, but its gameplay has moved on from the physics-based flinging that made the franchise famous.

Angry Birds Epic, released globally today for Android, iOS and Windows Phone devices, represents the series move into a new genre: roleplaying games (RPGs).

However, it is also the latest effort by publisher Rovio to capitalise on the ""free-to-play"" business model that now dominates the mobile games industry.

It's Rovio's second Angry Birds game built from the start as a free-to-play title that explores a new genre, following racing game Angry Birds Go, which launched in December 2013.

Angry Birds Epic has been available in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore since mid-March, as Rovio used early player feedback to hone the game and its system of in-app purchases.

The game adopts a turn-based RPG format, with players taking a team of birds into battle with their pig enemies, levelling their characters up while acquiring and upgrading weapons, armour and potions along the way.

It's free to download and play, but an in-app shop sells virtual coins, which can be spent on items and other gameplay features. The costs range from £0.69 for a ""pouch"" of 15 coins to £59.99 for a ""Mighty Eagle's Treasure Chest"" of 3,000 coins.

That marks Angry Birds Epic out as a game for adults, but the franchise's popularity with children may cause concern among parents about its highest tiers of in-app purchase – just as the option to pay £69.99 for a ""Big Bang Special Edition"" car in Angry Birds Go's beta sparked questions last year.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Angry Birds Epic's in-app coins store.

Rovio's early Angry Birds games were paid titles, bought with a single upfront purchase. Over time, the company diversified by adding in-app purchases, as well as building a thriving business in toys, merchandise and other licensed products.

Even so, Angry Birds' growth has paled next to the money being made by free-to-play games like Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans on smartphones and tablets.

Rovio's financial results for 2013 revealed revenues of €156m (£128.4m) compared to $1.9bn (£1.1bn) for Candy Crush developer King and $892m (£529.6m) for Clash of Clans maker Supercell.

Angry Birds fans will be less concerned with Rovio's business, and more interested in whether Angry Birds Epic is a good game.

""The Angry Birds characters are a perfect fit for a role-playing game because they have strong personalities and individual superpowers. They are almost like character classes from the get go,"" said Rovio's executive vice president of games Jami Laes, in a statement.

RPG purists may scoff, but early indications are that the blend of birds and battles works well. A couple of hours' playing this morning revealed a well-crafted introduction to the game's features, plenty of slapstick humour, and the makings of an interesting system for crafting weapons.

The real test will come further into the game, as it becomes clear how aggressively the in-app purchases are pushed, and how the game's various virtual currencies interlock.

Coins exchangeable for ""snoutlings"" and ""essences of friendship"" used for certain tasks, although all can also be earned by playing.

Angry Birds Epic's launch comes ahead of the next big expansion for Rovio's franchise: Angry Birds Stella. Aimed more at girls and women, that game will be released in September, alongside new toys, merchandise, books and cartoons.

1255,"If the Arkham Knight demo shown at E3 is anything to go by, Gotham's greatest enemy may not be the Penguin, the Joker or any other sociopathic super villain. It may be Batman's car. At the rate this armoured wrecking machine is able to plough through the city, there won't be much left of the Dark Knight's hometown by closing credits.

The Batmobile isn’t a car. It’s hell on wheels. Not only can it smash through fences, road barriers and concrete walls, it can deploy a powerful winch to rip down steel blockades and turn sections of the road into a ramp. And that’s before you get into the vehicle's Tank Mode, which gives the player a Vulcan Cannon and a set of missiles, allowing it to reduce other vehicles to smouldering metallic skeletons.



Batman was always a pretty formidable character, but with Rocksteady’s version of his classic ride, he's a one-man mobile army, causing carnage on the streets, then using the car’s ejector seat to land a flying kick into the face of some ne’er-do-well.

By all accounts, Batman is going to need these new abilities, as well as his new combat prowess, which allows him to use pieces of his environment to floor opponents. Not only has the Scarecrow threatened to detonate a fear toxin bomb that’ll cover the entire eastern seaboard, but most of Gotham’s more colourful villains have taken control of the streets and there’s a brand new villain in play – the Arkham Knight. This new rogue is hell-bent on the Dark Knight’s destruction and from the snippets of conversation in the E3 demo he seems to know Batman quite intimately; his hatred seems personal and he knows enough to direct his henchmen to fire at the weakest parts of Batman’s body armour.

The E3 demo showed that a lot of what made the Arkham series great is still in place, such as the brilliant way the game switches from stealth to combat to puzzle solving without missing a beat. But it also shows that the new features – the Batmobile, the new takedowns, the ability to launch higher and glide for longer – compliment both the existing mechanics and the game’s sprawling open-world structure. Nothing here seems done for the sake of it. Everything clicks together beautifully. Players may be in for a grim time in Gotham, but they’ll probably love every minute of it.

1257,"A Twitter user trying to code an emoji heart inadvertently discovered a vulnerability which forced the service to temporarily shut down its Tweetdeck client.



Twitter has now reopened Tweetdeck, having verified its security fix, but some users are still reporting issues due to caching of the web-based application.

TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) We've verified our security fix and have turned TweetDeck services back on for all users. Sorry for any inconvenience.

The Austrian teenager, who goes by the name Firo online, was experimenting with Tweetdeck, trying to get the service to display the unicode ♥ character.

Firo Xl (@firoxl) € © ♥ ü ♥

In the process, he found that anything in a tweet ending with the heart symbol would be treated by Tweetdeck as though it was HTML code, which could be used to change the formatting of tweets, or put an alert on users' screens. Just 14 minutes after discovering the flaw, Firo told Twitter of its existence, but by then it was too late: the vulnerability was in the wild.

Ninety minutes later, the first worm – the name given to a computer attack which is self-replicating – was created using the flaw, by German IT student @derGeruhn. The tweet uses the same vulnerability to make any user of an affected version of Tweetdeck retweet it automatically. At publication time, it has 81,500 retweets.

*andy (@derGeruhn) <script class=""xss"">$('.xss').parents().eq(1).find('a').eq(1).click();$('[data-action=retweet]').click();alert('XSS in Tweetdeck')</script>♥

Although Twitter has announced the flaw is fixed, some users are still reporting issues. The Political Scrapbook blog was hit by derGeruhn's worm on Thursday morning, more than 12 hours after Twitter confirmed the fix. The persistence seems to be related to caching issues: on web-based services, both users' computers and their internet service providers occasionally deliver old versions of webpages to save on bandwidth.

Twitter has been asked for further comment on what users can do to be certain they are protected from the vulnerability, but has not responded at publication time.

1259,"The World Cup will be unavoidable over the next month, even if you loathe football and everything that's wrong with the game. The tournament will be everywhere, from the high street, to the pub, to your gran's living room.

Cyber criminals are very happy about the febrile atmosphere around the beautiful game right now. For them, the World Cup is a perfect storm of scamming opportunities.

That means trouble for internet users and businesses relying on the tournament for revenues, and should be a warning to be careful who you trust when it comes to football-related online activity.

Or, as Rahul Kashyup, head of security research at security firm Bromium, puts it: ""Make 'paranoid' your default setting when you go online during this World Cup.""

Phishing emails and scam sites

The most prevalent threat this World Cup comes in the form of phishing attacks. These see messages sent over email and social networks promising all kinds of attractive content, from tickets and merchandise to footage of highlights or footballers behaving badly.

Clicking on the links in these messages may put you at risk of infection or identity theft. “Victims are redirected to websites that trick them into revealing personal information or downloading and installing malicious software,” says Tom Cross, director of security research at Lancope.

A common scam will present the user with a “necessary” software update that is supposedly required in order to play the video, notes Michael Sutton, VP of security research at Zscaler. Yet that update is just malware in disguise.



These kinds of attack are common and they work. GFI, a security company, claims that between 70 and 100 new phishing malware websites appear every day related to the World Cup.

In one case tracked by anti-virus firm Trend Micro, it uncovered a hoard of stolen credentials sold online by one of the cybercriminals using such phishing. “We believe that this particular cybercriminal has approximately 5,000 credit cards available to sell at any given time,” Trend researchers explained in a blog post.



The best advice is to use simple common sense. “As always, it pays to exercise street smarts when you use the Internet. If you get an unsolicited email with a suspicious attachment, don't open it. Don't enter personal information into websites if you're unsure of who operates them. And if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is,” says Cross.



Sutton adds: “The best way for users to protect themselves is to apply some common sense to their browsing habits – just as we avoid walking down a seedy alley, we should avoid suspicious links and websites.



“Users should be wary of downloading any unsolicited content or providing financial information to sites not officially affiliated with the FIFA World Cup. Looking for live coverage? Stick with one of the official broadcast partners of the FIFA World Cup for the country that you're in.”



Exploiting Cristiano Ronaldo love

One subtle twist on this kind of phishing is to create sites that users will likely search for. Instead of sending people links, criminal hackers can rely on people to flock to their site in search of World Cup content.



Intel-owned security company McAfee recently claimed that for this year’s competition, Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo is the world’s riskiest footballer to search for online. Crooks have created reams of websites claiming to offer screensaver downloads and videos around the Real Madrid star, but inside lurk threats.



Searching for the latest Ronaldo content brings a more than 3.76% chance of landing on a website that presents some kind of danger, whether that’s malware or aggressive adverts that access more data from your computer than they should, McAfee said.

For Lionel Messi, that drops to 3.72%, followed by Iker Casillas on 3.34%. There were no England players in the top 10, which tells you something about how cybercriminals see the team's chances of success at this World Cup.



“Maximising on Ronaldo’s popularity, cybercriminals have laid a number of malware traps for fans who search for the player,” says Ashish Patel, McAfee's regional director for network security in the UK and Ireland.



“Employees and home PC users should use tools to run a quick check on the legitimacy of the site, and try where possible to stick to official sites for downloads.” A good anti-virus product should come with a tool that checks website safety.

Attacks on World Cup business

For companies that are relying on the World Cup for business, now is a time of heightened danger. What if official sites go down so no one can check up on scores? Or merchandise websites stop working, meaning shoppers can’t buy kits and sellers miss out on significant revenue opportunities?



In the past, hackers have been known to call businesses and hold them to ransom, threatening to knock them offline with denial of service attacks if payment is not received. Retail sites are a regular target for such targets, so anyone selling football gear this summer needs to take heed.



Protesters might cause problems for business too. Hacktivist group Anonymous has said it will be targeting World Cup sponsors in protest at the sums of money being splurged on the competition, rather than on poor parts of Brazil. It has already claimed a successful attack on Brazil's Foreign Ministry networks, leaking apparently confidential emails.



“There is no doubt that being able to successfully attack the World Cup network would appeal to a hacker looking for publicity, and there is a risk from people with specific geopolitical agendas,” says Jane Wainwright, PwC consultant and former head of corporate security for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.



Wainwright, with obvious credentials in dealing with threats facing massive global events, recommends businesses take a collaborative approach to dealing with online targeting of their systems.



“Organisations should be working together to identify whether the World Cup is being targeted, as they will have intelligence that they can share to help collectively defend the event. They also need to test their own organisation's resilience to an attack or incident,” she adds.



""The media is a useful channel for organisations to communicate to the public about the potential risks, and what to look out for in relation to rogue websites when buying merchandise or tickets online, or sharing their information on World Cup websites.''



Intelligence-based systems, which should pick up on any strange activity on the network, will help uncover nasties on the network too, adds Patel.

“The sophisticated nature of advanced evasion techniques means companies could be unaware their networks are compromised, so it is important that businesses take serious measures to identify threats and remove them as soon as possible.”



Dodgy World Cup Wi-Fi

For anyone lucky enough to actually be at the World Cup in Brazil, there are many digital threats to watch out for. One likely avenue for attack will be via public Wi-Fi points either controlled by attackers, or monitored by them.



When users get online via these Wi-Fi networks, their traffic can be intercepted. If it’s not properly protected, with things like encryption, attackers can pick up useful data, such as usernames and passwords.

Insecure Wi-Fi hotspots, which don’t require proper authentication or provide decent protection around the data passing over the network, are rife in Brazil.

Russian security firm Kaspersky recently went to Sao Paulo, where many games will be held, in the middle of May 2014. It found more than 5,000 different access points in the city and “some of them are clearly not secured at all”, with 26% completely open and without encryption. These kinds of Wi-Fi points should be avoided.



The same researchers warned about fake charging points. These will charge your battery over USB, but will also silently steal data from your smartphone and in some cases will upload viruses. Again, the advice is to only use points you’re fairly sure you can trust.



“Anyone attending connecting a device to a public Wi-Fi hot spot, even at a trusted brand outlet, should be wary of the fact they could be opening the doors to a hacker and avoid accessing sensitive personal and work websites,” says James Nunn-Price, UK cyber security lead at Deloitte.



Credit card skimming

Kaspersky has also warned about the potential for credit card cloning and point of sale attacks, where people’s card data can be pilfered and used to steal funds. This can be done via skimmer devices attached to ATMs, whilst others have installed entirely fake cash machines.



The best protection here is simply to keep your wits about you, says Kaspersky. “keen eye - if you see something that doesn’t look right, notify the bank or owner of the machine, and go somewhere else to withdraw your cash.”



Hackers have found ways to get malware on to PIN pads, where the information is gleaned and sent to the criminals’ computers.



“There is not much you can do to avoid falling victim to this, so please keep a close eye on your credit card statement to check all transactions and inform your bank immediately if you see something suspicious. Wherever possible try to pay using a wireless point of sale device – they’re a bit more secure than the older ones connected to serial or USB ports,” Kaspersky recommended.



Whether you’re wrapped up in the World Cup hysteria or not, taking any of this advice on board will help you avoid digital attacks, whatever their form.

1261,"Artists and technologists are collaborating in a 24-hour hack the Tate Modern this weekend, celebrating the launch of digital art platform The Space

Ai Weiwei's voice is shrill and rhythmic, echoing against the walls of the Tate Modern. His chants in Mandarin could almost be poetry, but in translation, he is reciting the names of all 5,196 children and young people who died in 2008's Sichuan earthquake in China.

Ai originally created the piece as part of his Nian, or remembrance work, on the second anniversary of the earthquake in 2010. It took the efforts of 3,500 people on Ai's blog and through Twitter to collate the names of all the victims; the Chinese government refused to release any information and was accused of causing the tragedy through badly-built schools and government buildings.

But Ai's new recording, as well as the text names of all the victims, is now being made available to a group of technologists and artists at an ambitious art hack this weekend, alongside contributions from fellow artists including David Hockney, Marina Abramovic and Jeremy Deller. Web inventor Tim Berners Lee has also contributed data.

The video, audio and text data they contribute will be used for the creative coding event. Nearly 150 rival coders and artists will use parts of the data to create their own digital works during an intense 24-hour hack, with prizes award tonight for the winners.

The hack in the Tate Modern's main Turbine Hall is being used to celebrate the launch of The Space, an online arts platform created by the BBC and the Arts Council of Britain.

Speaking by video message Ai, who has not been allowed to leave China since 2012, said he welcomed a new platform for artists to explore. ""Let's make an effort: a world with more possibilities and new ways to communicate and express ourselves,"" he said.

An excerpt from Ai's recording.

The Space

The event tasks participants with the brief to ""take any data and turn it into a work of art."" As well as Ai Weiwei's data, other organisations offering up information include the Tate, the Open Data Institute, and the Guardian, which is also sending a team of 14 developers to take part in the hackathon.

The Space will showcase the work of digital artists from across the world, commissioning 50 works a year from artists, both known and unknown, putting out an open call for applications.

""We ask anyone over the age of 18, anywhere in the world, who has a brilliant idea, to send that idea to us,"" says Ruth Mackenzie, The Space's launch director. ""'Out of the best ideas, we'll commission projects, and share them back with the world. We believe in talent wherever it may come, anywhere in the world.""

One of the first pieces to be showcased on The Space is a collaboration between Ai Weiwei and Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson named Moon, an interactive digital work on which users are invited to leave their own mark, drawn or written, on a virtual moon's surface. The piece, which will be presented as part of Hack the Space, hearkens back to Eliasson's monumental installation The Weather Project, the very first artwork installed in the Tate's turbine hall.

""It's interactive, which means that anyone anywhere in the world can post their own art,"" said Mackenzie. ""They can contribute to transforming the moon, they can go to the moon in an artistic sort of way. And we hope that we may get the chance to post some work in progress from the hack up on the moon.""

The data-driven theme of the hack day was underscored by another backer of the event, the Open Data Institute's Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt. ""One of the privileges and thrills of my life is to have worked with Tim Berners Lee, who invented and actually gave us the web, and made it an open space. In the research we do we're trying to develop the next generation of web technology. But Tim's vision, and what we're trying to achieve, was to see the world as humanity connected.""

1263,"Apple has begun a ""voluntary exchange"" of southern European-style USB adapters shipped to 37 countries between October 2009 and September 2012, because they could overheat and pose a safety risk.

The company says it will offer a free exchange of the adapters, which were provided with the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S in countries ranging from Albania to Vietnam - though not the UK. But the move is not defined as a recall because it has not been ordered by any official body.

""We have voluntarily decided to exchange every affected power adapter for a new, redesigned adapter, free of charge. We encourage customers to exchange any affected adapter for a new one as soon as possible,"" the company says.

Apple hasn't described the nature of the fault, or how many chargers were found to have the problem. While there have been a number of cases of fires and even electrocutions linked to the use of Apple-style adaptors in Asia, they have been linked to use of almost identical counterfeits which lack sufficient insulation systems to protect users.

In 2008 Apple ran a USB adapter exchange program affecting ""ultracompact"" adapters used in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico and a number of Latin American countries. In that case the problem was that the flat ""blade"" plug pins could pull out too easily.

• Customers who have an affected charger - identified by the numbering ""Model A1300"" on the top right and the ""CE"" mark being outlined in grey - can swap it at an Apple Store or via an authorised service provider. Claimants will need their iPhone for verification of purchase, Apple says.

1265,"Ubisoft has come under fire for its lack of playable female characters in the latest Assassin's Creed game. Tell us which games you think have the best female characters

Ubisoft has come under fire after first axing the inclusion of female playable characters in their latest Assassin's Creed game, Unity. They later claimed their inclusion would have ""doubled the work"" on the game.

In an interview, Ubisoft technical director James Therien told VideoGamer.com it was a ""question of focus and production.""

A female character means that you have to redo a lot of animation, a lot of costumes [inaudible]. It would have doubled the work on those things. And I mean it's something the team really wanted, but we had to make a decision... It's unfortunate, but it's a reality of game development.""

Their reasoning hasn't gone down too well.

creeping horror (@redfivetwo) ""Female bone structure is just different,"" says Joe Ubisoft. ""Are there spiders in there? We just don't know.""

This is by no means the first, nor will it be the last time, a game has come under fire for its lack of female representation. But the ""women don't play video games"" excuse doesn't fly anymore – in fact, nearly half of gamers are women.

It would take for ever to list all the times games were a bit sexist, so we thought we'd shine a light on those games which have some great female characters. Which games do you feel represented women the best? Here are a few to get you started:

Portal

Portal is one of those games when you play a female character, but it doesn't really make a difference either way. The only time you really see protagonist Chell outside of game art is if you catch a glimpse of her through portals during the game. Then there's the sadistic antagonist, the eerie robot GLaDOS, who's responsible for some of the funniest bits in the game.

Metroid

It's not until the end of the original Metroid on NES that the player realises Samus Aran is a woman. A woman who single-handedly wipes out an enemy race, no less. While it's a big twist at the end of the 1986 game, developers didn't have to do much to convince gamers Samus was pretty cool. Nearly 30 years later, she remains a memorable and popular character.

Beyond Good and Evil

Part of the reason Ubisoft's move to remove playable female characters has annoyed so many is that they've often stated they're committed to diversity in their games. Case in point: Beyond Good and Evil, with its reporter/martial artist protagonist Jade. Ubisoft developer Michel Ancel set out to create a game with a well-rounded female character. As a result, Jade has been featured on countless lists of top female characters in video games.

Here are some of your suggestions...

And she may *technically* be a robot, but GLaDOS is a definite favourite.

1267,"The news that Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the seminal dark fantasy video game Dark Souls would take a supervising role on its sequel in order to focus on a new title was met with consternation by some. But it was a sensible decision by From Software, the Shinjuku-based company of which Miyazaki is now president. As the Japanese video game industry groans with the dead weight of so many sequels, Miyazaki’s fidgety creativity and vision should be put to use in crafting new games, rather than, as with many of his aging contemporaries, merely attempting to perfect or freshen old ones.

This is not to say that Bloodborne, the result of Miyazaki’s post-Dark Souls project, doesn't share similarities with his previous fantasy-inspired work. The aesthetic is entirely different: all uneven cobblestones, flickering oil lamps, mist-cloaked grates and spindly iron fencing. Its stratospherically tall churches owe more to Nicholas Hawksmoor and Christopher Wren than the catholic intricacy of Dark Souls’ cathedrals. Likewise, the game’s protagonist struts and rolls in leather and cloth fabric rather than burnished armour: he moves quicker and more freely, something that suits his tall frame.

But the feel of the game, as seen behind closed doors at the E3 conference in Los Angeles this week, is entirely Dark Souls. This is most readily seen in the combat which is familiarly weighty and considered, where fighters heave and reel, where a misjudged swipe of a sword can prove deadly to both player and foe. Fools rush in, and if you’re outnumbered you’ll struggle to make it out of a skirmish alive: better to pick enemies off one by one. Nevertheless, there appears to be a great deal of room for player expression and theatrics in combat. Fire the gun into the gut of an incoming monster for example and, if the timing’s correct, you’ll be able to follow-up with a grisly melee attack.

While any HUD had been cleaned off the screen for this demo, downed enemies seemed to give up a mist like spirit, and some cadavers were lit up where they lay by glowing items ripe for picking. But in contrast to Dark Souls, the Lovecraftian characters, who glare out from under the brim of leather hats, wield blunderbusses. Your own character holds a sword cleaver in one hand (which can be extended with a flick of the wrist) and a musket in the other. Here, the steampunk inventor appears to have more value than the blacksmith.

Years ago, Sony worked with Miyazaki on Dark Souls’ predecessor Demons Souls, and it has given this new game its full-throated support, presenting Bloodborne front and centre at its E3 press conference. That the Japanese publisher would be enamoured with the game is understandable: it looks exquisite on PlayStation 4. A full moon casts shadows over the city of Yharnam’s streets; light rises from the flickering flames of burning monsters hoisted onto crosses in the town centre. The population is, according to Miyazaki, suffering from a mysterious illness, which keeps them in a state of shuffling, heightened paranoia.

Miyazaki and his designers’ talent for creating disturbing but never grotesque monsters is evident again here. As you cross one bridge you’re attacked by a group of belly-flopping oversized crows, too fat to fly, but who peck at your character with chunky beaks.



In one house you find an old man sat in a wheelchair. As you turn to face him he starts firing an old, gramophone-like pistol from his lap, the gunpowder blast sending his chair creaking backwards with each violent shot. In another area, your character comes to another non-player character that appears to be fighting the bedevilled townspeople. You can choose to help him, an action that will supposedly have repercussions later in the game.

On this showing Bloodborne is a bleak, affecting proposition. Its themes are depressing, its execution violent and urgent and yet, as with all of his work, there is the promise of something hopeful in amongst the darkness. Miyazaki is one of the most vibrant, imaginative and skilled designers working in video games today. Bloodborne appears to both confirm and redouble his reputation.

1269,"Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear series has always presented a curious blend of serious themes (nuclear war, military corruption) with action-movie humour and theatrics. The Phantom Pain, Kojima’s forthcoming blockbuster entry to the series, is no different.



It’s a game that, among other things, takes aim at the US detention of terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay. It’s also a game in which the protagonist, Snake, lives on a giant oil rig surrounded by a private army he calls the ""Diamond Dogs"". While the juxtaposition in theme and tone may jar, the inclusion of this sea-bound base allows Kojima to revisit one of the strongest game design elements yet seen in the series, the ability to airlift enemy soldiers that Snake tranquilises back to this base during missions in order to swell the ranks of his army.

In The Phantom Pain, it’s not only downed foes that can be airlifted to safety (using a mechanism called the Fulton recovery system, which attaches a balloon to the soldier’s foot, yanking him into the air before floating him back to base). Enemy vehicles, gun turrets, weapons, diamonds and shipment containers can all be sent back home. During a studio presentation behind closed doors at the E3 conference this week, one developer demonstrated how even the local wildlife can be airlifted back to base: a tottering sheep was yanked into the sky with a yelp and a shower of fluff. Indeed, every mission in the field presents a new opportunity for Snake to scavenge for resources.

Once soldiers have been returned to your base they can be assigned different research roles there; the more men you have on a certain research team the quicker you’ll unlock new items that can be airdropped by the R&D department into the field during a mission (a carefully placed airdrop will even knock out an unsuspecting soldier if you manage to land it on his head). Eventually, you’re able to call in airstrikes and other mission-transforming back up.

Unlike in Peace Walker, the Metal Gear spin-off in which the Mother Base debuted, you are now able to visit your burgeoning fortress in the ocean, spending accrued GMP (the game’s currency gained from completed missions and airlifting diamonds and other valuable resources back to the base) on defences such as UAVs and even new add-ons to the base. Kojima boasts that no two bases will be identical and, as you make this rig your home you’ll want to show it off to other players. On the rig, both Snake and your captured soldiers are able to train and upgrade their proficiency in shooting and close quarters combat.

The base itself is also susceptible to attack. From time to time an alarm will sound and your troops (who salute every time Snake passes them) will rally to their designated positions. In this way, the Mother Base becomes something akin to a tower defence game: the more defensive items that you airlift from the field the better prepared it will be to withstand any attacks.

Away from the base on the field, this is a technological marvel, a vast pen world filled with interactive possibility. Clouds wheel through the sky casting dynamic shadows, coming together and parting in unrepeated patterns with the passing of time. The Phantom Pain’s dynamic weather system even plays a role in the Fulton recovery system. During a sandstorm, for example, it’s best not to attempt to airlift a soldier or military hardware from the field as the recovery balloon is influenced by weather and may be blown off course en route back to base.

The tonal juxtaposition that defines Kojima’s work is in full effect here in the expansive wilds. As you trot on horseback into one of the first areas of the game, the reeds tilt in the wind and the sand whips up in tiny clouds. On cue your horse lifts its tail and defecates with a nasal harrumph. That's probably one asset that Snake needn’t airlift back to base.

1271,"Google is in talks to buy a stake in Virgin Galactic, Sir Richard Branson's space tourism business, that would give it access to satellite launch technology, according to reports. The deal, estimated to be worth £17.8m, has not yet been sealed, but negotiations are thought to be at an advanced stage.

Sky News has reported that negotiations between the two companies have been going on for months and, according to anonymous insiders cited by the channel, the talks are likely to lead to a deal with two main elements.

First, Google would provide hundreds of millions of dollars to help fund a joint venture, with Virgin Galactic contributing the technology that it has developed while trying to build its space tourism business.

Second, Google would buy a small stake – likely to be around 1.5% – in the Virgin Galactic holding company. The sum of £17.8m would suggest that Branson's business is valued at around £1.2bn.

Virgin's space tourism business has suffered from a number of teething problems, but it insists that it will be ready to launch later this year. It could gain some much needed credibility from a deal with a firm like Google.

It emerged on Tuesday that Google has also set its sights on buying the satellite company Skybox Imaging. The $500m (£298m) acquisition will enable Google to improve the quality and immediacy of the imagery used in its digital maps, it was reported.

Skybox's satellite is already in orbit.

1273,"Latest forecast suggests deceleration in emerging markets such as China as smartphones, 'phablets' and tablets take over

Bad news if you're a PC maker: the research company IDC's latest forecast says that total shipments this year will fall by 6% compared to 2013 to 296.3m, itself a year when shipments fell by a record 10% to 315.1m.

IDC's latest longer-range forecast to 2018 is also gloomy about PC prospects in emerging markets – previously the source of growth.

But there's bad news for tablet makers too. IDC has slashed its forecast for future tablet sales, based on slowing replacement cycles which put them closer to PCs than smartphones.

Nor is there good news for those making ""2-in-1"" devices – PCs with detachable keyboards such as Microsoft's Surface or Lenovo's Yoga range. IDC forecasts that only 9.9m will be shipped in 2014, and that even by 2018 they will only comprise 27.4m - equivalent to 8% of the tablet market (in which it classes them), or 9% of the PC market for laptops and desktops.

IDC's forecast for 2014 was released before Intel raised its forecast revenues for this year, on the basis of expected higher business PC shipments, and said that it thought there would be ""some"" revenue growth this year rather than its previous ""approximately flat"" outlook.

Although IDC's forecast goes out as far as four years into the future, it has consistently guided downwards on PC sales - and those lower estimates have tended to be correct, according to a time series of the forecasts collected by the Guardian.

IDC's forecast for mature market desktop/portable and emerging market desktop/portable, and tablets (including 2-in-1s). Photograph: /Guardian/IDC

In the graph above, each vertical line is a forecast made at a different time; earlier forecasts for each year are on the left of each series. The trend has been towards lower PC sales (the aggregate stack of blue, green and red) - and, now, lower forecast tablet sales (the orange line).

Whereas emerging markets such as China and Africa have previously been the source of growth for PC sales, IDC is now lowering its future forecasts both for desktop and portable machines. Those point to sales of both desktops and portable machines being lower in 2018 than in 2013 in those countries; in aggregate they will be almost equal with 2014's forecast total of 163m units.

For developed markets such as the north America and Europe, the story is even worse: they will fall from around 133m units in 2013 and 2014 to 123.4m in 2018, says IDC.

The PC market has slowed dramatically since 2011 as it has moved to a ""replacement"" market for the existing install base of around 1.6bn machines, while smartphone sales in particular have taken off, passing PCs at the end of 2010 and now on course to ship 1.2bn units in 2014 alone.

Emerging shifts - away from PCs

""2014 represents an important shift for the PC market in emerging regions,"" said Jay Chou, IDC's senior research analyst. ""Shipments in these parts of the world are expected to contract in double digits - nearly 20m units fewer - compared to 2013. Political and economic instability in many of these markets are key factors affecting short-term intake, but a fundamental shift toward computing across the device spectrum represents a broader transition.""

The problem for PC makers is that smartphones and tablets - and especially large-screened phones known as ""phablets"" - are eating into the potential for PC companies.

The problems are evident in the financial results of PC makers such as Taiwan's Asus and Acer, which each saw revenues from their PC divisions fall by 20% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2014 on shipments that were down 10% and 20% respectively. Japan's Sony is exiting the PC market completely, while Korea's LG is believed to be cutting back substantially. Dell, once the world's largest PC maker, went private last year amid growing pressure on PC margins. Only China's Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC business in 2005, has shown consistently improving profit margins on PCs.

But PC makers that had hoped to find refuge in tablets might also be discouraged by IDC's forecast on tablets (including 2-in-1 models). While it is forecasting 19.4% growth in 2014, that is down from an explosive 51.6% in 2013 - suggesting that the market is already hitting saturation of sorts in some areas.

IDC's expectation that tablet sales would outstrip those of PCs in the last quarter of 2013 didn't come to fruition - and now it seems that replacement cycles for tablets are more like four to five years, rather than the two or three years some makers had hoped.

Tablet wars: slate v 2-in-1

In data supplied exclusively to the Guardian, IDC now forecasts that tablet shipments in 2017 will hit 323.6m, of which 300m will be ""slate"" tablets such as the iPad, compared to a 2-in-1 market of 23.6m and combined desktop and laptop PC market of 289.6m units.

In that, IDC forecasts that consumer buyers will still be the largest segment of the tablet and 2-in-1 market, taking 82% - or 265m units - while the remaining 18%, or 58m, will go to commercial buyers.

But the rapid price erosion that had been seen in tablet prices seems to be slowing, IDC said, as so-called ""white box"" vendors - who offering cheap devices which tend to be used for watching video content - find that consumers prefer higher-priced devices from trusted brands.

Microsoft's investment in the Surface and Windows 8 may pay off over the long term in the commercial segment, suggests Jitesh Ubrani, tablet research analyst at IDC. ""Though Android and iOS will remain dominant, we expect Windows-based devices to capture more than a quarter of the market as its benefits become apparent thanks to growing adoption of 2-in1s.""

1275,"Discount travel company argues that there is opportunity to cross-promote between other brands it owns and that 'travellers are diners'

Discount travel and ticketing company Priceline is buying OpenTable, the online restaurant reservation business, for $2.6bn in an all-cash deal that will expand it into a new business segment.

""Travellers are diners,"" said Priceline's chief executive Darren Huston. ""It's the same customers. There's opportunity to cross-promote brands.""

Priceline will pay $103 per share, a 46% premium on OpenTable's closing price on Thursday of $70.43. Shares of OpenTable soared $33.59, or 47.7%, to $104.02 - above the offer price - in morning trading Friday.

Founded 15 years ago, OpenTable finds seats for more than 15 million diners per month at more than 31,000 restaurants in the US, UK, Japan, German and Mexico. It has 700 employees.

OpenTable, available via a web browser or app, lets users make restaurant reservations for free. Its revenues come from charging restaurants fees for the bookings. Users can also read reviews of the restaurants and view menus through the website.

Around 40% of bookings come through the mobile app in the US, and one-third in the UK and Germany. About 20 restaurants are currently piloting a direct payment model where diners' bills and tips are charged and paid via the app. That would mean diners could move on from restaurants more quickly, and thus increase the available table time for new customers.

""OpenTable is not just about making reservations online,"" Matthew Roberts, OpenTable's chief executive, told the Guardian last week. ""It's also about maximising the efficiency of restaurants, getting the maximum number of 'turns' per table.""

The table reservations company will still be based in San Francisco, and will operate as an independent business led by its current management team.

Huston said Priceline's first goal is to expand OpenTable internationally. Users can already book restaurants through OpenTable in London, Berlin, Hong Kong and other cities, but Huston said it wanted to bring it to more cities. Since Priceline already has ""offices in every major city in the world,"" doing so should be seamless, he said.

OpenTable is also working on making it easier to sign up new restaurants to its service, said Huston. The company is working on creating a cloud-based system instead of using the hardware it currently needs restaurants to install to use OpenTable.

At Priceline, an average of more than 1 million guests stay in accommodations booked through one of brands each night. It has more than 480,000 properties in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.

Based in Norwalk, Connecticut, Priceline Group changed its name in April from Priceline.com to better reflect its overall business. Its brands include Booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com, KAYAK and rentalcars.com.

1277,"A new indie video games event is coming to London – and I'm partially responsible. Last year, myself, games producer Georg Backer and James Dance, manager of the Loading games bar, decided to run an alternative to the giant E3 exhibition in London – mostly because we were all a bit cross to be missing out that year. We organised it in three weeks, cheekily calling it E-Too, and inviting dozens of small development studios, as well as the likes of Sony, Sega and Ubisoft.

It was a great succcess, with hundreds of attendees, some wonderful games and a lot of fun. This year the event is back, with the the same philosophy of showcasing games by smaller studios - but with a new more sensible name, Radius. Today, we've been able to announce the full-line-up of over 50 titles, set to be shown at the very sleek White Space venue from June 19-21.

Among the titles are Mike Bithell's historical cyberpunk stealth game, Volume, stylish gravitational puzzler orbitalis, riotous eighties-inspired co-op blaster Tango Fiesta and the bizzare Ludam Dare entry, Super Rude Bear Resurrection. There will also be surprise additions to the agenda, potentially including several big titles from mainstream publishers.



And once again, each evening will see a live chat show, set to be streamed over Twitch, where we talk to developers and surpise guests and generally do silly things for the camera and audience. Last year this included two guest apparences by comedian and actor Rufus Hound, and a musical interlude by Bafta events organiser Dave Green performing cover versions on ""upcycled"" Guitar Hero controllers.

As usual, it has been a scramble to get things organised, but thanks to the heroic efforts of Backer, the assistance of UKIE chairman Andy Payne, and the sponsorship of Sega, Mike Bithell and Mastertronic, it has come alive at the last moment. We wanted to celebrate the joy and sense of community in the British games scene, and the British games scene has come out to help in their droves. We ran a special Radius E3 press conference event at the new Loading Bar in Dalston last week and over 200 people turned up.



Radius will be free to attend during the days, but the evening event has a small charge (which will include free digital copies of up to three games). This is a totally non-profit-making endeavour, born out of our collective passion for independent game development and a lack of interest in making money. It's just fun to get a lot of nice people in a room playing, sharing and talking about video games. Please do come along if you can.

• Radius Exhbition runs from June 19-21. Entry for the day event are free, but those wishing to attend need to apply for tickets in advance.

1279,"New Galaxy Tab S is thinner, lighter and first to use a high-resolution OLED screen, but is it enough to beat the iPad Air?

Samsung has beaten Apple to a fingerprint-reading tablet with the launch of two new flagship Galaxy Tab S models, four months before Apple unveils its next iPad.



The new 8.4in and full-sized 10.5in Galaxy Tab S are also the first tablets available with a high-resolution large-size organic LED (OLED) screen showing that the new display technology, which emits its own light and does not need a backlight, has reached maturity beyond smaller smartphone screens and high-priced televisions.

OLED screens are widely expected to replace LCDs in most instances, being more power-efficient and producing more vibrant colours with deeper blacks than is possible with the LCD screens like those used by most smartphones, tablets, laptops and televisions.

The new device is Samsung's latest move to capitalise on its growing share of the world tablet market. The company claimed an 18% share of the global tablet market in 2013 with 39.2m tablets shipped, compared to Apple’s 35% and 74.3m tablets, giving them together more than half of all shipments.

“The tablet is becoming a popular personal viewing device for enjoying content, which makes the quality of the display a critical feature,” said JK Shin, CEO and president of Samsung's IT & Mobile Division. “With the launch of the Galaxy Tab S, Samsung is setting the industry bar higher for the entire mobile industry. It will provide consumers with a visual and entertainment experience that brings colours to life, beautifully packaged in a sleek and ultra-portable mobile device.”

Denise Yuan, tablet planner for Samsung, told the Guardian: ""We performed a lot of research on consumer usage and found that people mainly use tablets for web browsing, videos and gaming - entertainment mostly, which made the display the most important part and why we focused on bringing our Super AMOLED screen to the Tab S.”

Samsung claims that the Tab S's Super AMOLED screen has a contrast ratio 100 times better than LCD, which makes text easier to read on screen, but also photos and videos appear closer in depth of colour to the real world as the eye sees it.

It’s all about touch

Apple is widely expected to bring its Touch ID fingerprint sensor, released with the iPhones 5S in September last year, to its iPad Air and iPad mini tablets in October, marking a year since the Cupertino-based company unveiled the biggest design change in its tablet’s history with the iPad Air.

The Galaxy Tab S runs the latest version of Google’s Android “KitKat” 4.4.2, but uses Samsung’s ""TouchWiz"" customisations to the basic Android experience, which the Korean company also uses on its Galaxy smartphones and other Galaxy tablets.

The Tab S uses Samsung’s own Samsung Exynos eight-core processor – instead of the Qualcomm processors used in almost every other premium Android tablet and smartphone – with 3GB of RAM and 16 or 32GB of internal storage as well as a microSD card slot for adding more space for music, videos and photos. Models with 3G and 4G capabilities, able to make calls and send text messages, are also available.

Samsung hopes that the fingerprint scanner, like that introduced on the company’s flagship smartphone the Galaxy S5 in April, as well as the 10.5in Tab S’s thin 6.6mm frame and 465g weight – which is 0.9mm thinner and 4g lighter than the iPad Air – will help in its battle for dominance with Apple and win customers from rivals.

Samsung has made significant progress in marketshare for its range of tablets over the last year, making the battle for tablet sales globally a two-horse race with Apple.

After Apple and Samsung, Asus came third in the global rankings with 5% and 10.4m shipped, while Amazon came in fourth with 4.6% and 9.8m of its Kindle Fire tablets shipped, according to data from research firm IDC.

Breaking down by region, Apple claimed 34% of Western Europe versus Samsung’s 23% marketshare, while Apple dominated the UK in 2013 with 39% of the market to Samsung’s 16%. In the US, Apple is even more entrenched with a 44% share of the market leaving Samsung with an 18% share.

Fast forward to the first quarter of 2014 and Samsung has shown significant gains. Globally, Samsung claimed 22% of tablet sales compared with Apple’s 34%, while in western Europe, Samsung increased its market share to 30% with Apple decreasing one percent to 34%.

In the UK, Samsung had a 26% share of tablets, while Apple claimed a 35% share. In the US Samsung jumped to 26% of the market, while Apple increased slightly to 45%.

“Samsung is making significant progress in tablet marketshare,” explained Francisco Jeronimo, research director of IDC. “But its gains in share have not been at the expense of Apple, but of the other tablet vendors.”

He said that the cause is down to apps. “That is the result of the Android tablet app ecosystem not being as strong as it is for Apple’s iPad.”

‘Most apps are merely scaled up version of phone apps on Android’

Android tablets have struggled to garner the interest of developers, whereas Apple has persuaded developers to create apps specifically tailored for the larger screens. While Android is arguably on par with Apple’s iOS for smartphone apps, it still lags on tablets.

“Apple has effectively locked out the market for high quality tablet apps with the 475,000+ 'made for iPad' apps,” says Ben Wood from research firm CCS Insight. “Developers seem to feel it is worth the effort to optimise their apps specifically for the iPad, which means you get a great experience.

“On Android, other than a few exceptions, most apps are merely scaled up version of phone apps. This is not such a problem on a 7in screen – but once you get to 10in and above it becomes a real issue,” continued Wood.

The Galaxy Tab S is unlikely to change that status quo but provides another premium Android tablet option, joining the thin and light Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet for those that do not want to buy into Apple’s walled garden and its iPad.

The Tab S will be available between the end of June and beginning of July and costs around $399 for the 8.4in version and $499 for the 10.5in variant.

The 10.5in Tab S also adds yet another screen size to Samsung’s tumefied range of Galaxy tablets which currently span the Tab 4 7, Tab 4 8, Tab Pro 8.4, Tab 4 10.1, Tab Pro 10.1, Note 10.1, Note Pro 12.2, as well as others like the Tab 3 Kids.

1281,"Good morning! Or evening, if you happen to be reading this on the other side of the world. Our topic for today is the internet. What? You already know about the internet? No, no, I don't mean that internet, the boring old one you use to access YouTube and send Facebook updates, email and tweets and stuff. That's the internet of people and it's so, well, yesterday. I'm talking about the new internet, which is going to be the latest thing Real Soon Now.

It's called the Internet of Things or IoT and it's got everybody very excited over in Silicon Valley, where they hyperventilate a lot about technology. When you ask them what it is they say things such as ""a global, immersive, invisible, ambient networked computing environment built through the continued proliferation of smart sensors, cameras, software, databases and massive data centres in a world-spanning information fabric"".

Translated into English, that means billions of gadgets, each one of them connected to the internet and communicating madly with one another without much in the way of human intervention. So your fridge can talk to your smartphone to tell it that you're running out of milk, while your bathroom scales messages your GP's computer to let it know that you're not sticking to your diet plan, and the webcam in your living room sends you a text to tell you that the cat has been sick on the sofa, and cool stuff like that.

You think I jest? Think again. I tell you, this thing is Big. Why, only the other day, an outfit called IDC said that the Internet of Things is going to generate a staggering $7.1tn in sales by 2020. No, that's not a misprint: I meant trillions. Who is this IDC? It's a ""market intelligence"" firm, apparently. And yes I know it sounds like an oxymoron, like ""military intelligence"", but the whole of the tech industry takes these guys seriously because everyone needs numbers to justify their investments. How else would Facebook have known that WhatsApp was worth $19bn?

Like I said, everybody who is anybody in the tech business is very turned on by the IoT. It's going to make lots of money – oh, and it'll change the world, too. Of course there are some boring old creeps who keep raining on the parade. Spoilsports, I call them. There are, for example, the ""security"" experts who think that the IoT opens up horrendous vulnerabilities for our networked society. Hackers in Azerbaijan could get control of our ""smart"" electricity meters and shut down the whole of East Anglia with the click of a mouse. Pshaw! As if the folks in Azerbaijan even knew there was such a place as East Anglia. Or some guy in Anonymous could remotely jam the accelerator in your car so that you drive into your garage at 130mph even when you have your foot firmly on the brake. As if!

That's why it's sooo annoying when the media publicise scare stories about security lapses involving connected gadgets. I mean to say, how could TRENDnet have known that its ""secure"" security webcams weren't really secure at all? It's not its fault that a hacker broke into the SecurView camera software and told other people how to do it. The result, according to the US Federal Trade Commission, was that ""hackers posted links to the live feeds of nearly 700 of the cameras. The feeds displayed babies asleep in their cribs, young children playing and adults going about their daily lives"".

This is so unfair. Poor old TRENDnet makes security cameras. Why should it know anything about internet security? Same story for Toyota and Volvo and co. They make cars – bloody good ones, too. Sure, they have a lot of electronics in them, but that's just standalone engine-management kit. Nothing to do with networks. Why should they be pilloried just because they know nothing about network security?

What's that? You've found an IDC report from last October saying the Internet of Things would produce $8.9tn in sales by 2020. So the IoT has ""lost"" $1.8tn in eight months? Well, yes, I have to agree it doesn't look good, especially for the Next Big Thing, but, hey, what's $1.8tn between friends when we're talking about the future of civilisation? And no, I don't think that William Goldman's crack that ""nobody knows anything"" has any relevance here. He was writing about Hollywood, for God's sake. We're talking about the tech business. Different thing entirely.",The Internet of Things: it's a really big deal,http://www.theguardian.com,[John Naughton],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402590004225/internet-of-things-009.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=debe74065fd06434f9ba14d8ddfaf2c2,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/15/networker-internet-of-things-john-naughton-hacking
1283,"Advances in technology have long been recognised as a threat to manual labour. Now highly skilled, knowledge-based jobs that were once regarded as safe could be at risk. How will they adapt to the digital age?

Last year, reporters for the Associated Press attempted to figure out which jobs were being lost to new technology. They analysed employment data from 20 countries and interviewed experts, software developers and CEOs. They found that almost all the jobs that had disappeared in the past four years were not low-skilled, low-paid roles, but fairly well-paid positions in traditionally middle-class careers. Software was replacing administrators and travel agents, bookkeepers and secretaries, and at alarming rates.

Economists and futurists know it's not all doom and gloom, but it is all change. Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerisation could make nearly half of jobs redundant within 10 to 20 years. Office work and service roles, they wrote, were particularly at risk. But almost nothing is impervious to automation. It has swept through shop floors and factories, transformed businesses big and small, and is beginning to revolutionise the professions.

Knowledge-based jobs were supposed to be safe career choices, the years of study it takes to become a lawyer, say, or an architect or accountant, in theory guaranteeing a lifetime of lucrative employment. That is no longer the case. Now even doctors face the looming threat of possible obsolescence. Expert radiologists are routinely outperformed by pattern-recognition software, diagnosticians by simple computer questionnaires. In 2012, Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla predicted that algorithms and machines would replace 80% of doctors within a generation.

In their much-debated book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argued that we now face an intense period of creative destruction. ""Technological progress,"" they warned, ""is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead … there's never been a worse time to be a worker with only 'ordinary' skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate.""

So where does that leave the professions, whose hard-won expertise is beginning to fall within the power of computers and artificial intelligence to emulate? The efficiency of computerisation seems likely to spell the end of the job security past generations sought in such careers. For many, what were once extraordinary skillsets will soon be rendered ordinary by the advance of the machines. What will it mean to be a professional then?

""We'll see what I call decomposition, the breaking down of professional work into its component parts,"" says leading legal futurist professor Richard Susskind. Susskind's forthcoming book Beyond the Professions, co-authored with his son Daniel Susskind, examines the transformations already underway across the sectors that once offered jobs for life. He predicts a process not unlike the division of labour that wiped out skilled artisans and craftsmen in the past: the dissolution of expertise into a dozen or more streamlined processes.

""Some of these parts will still require expert trusted advisers acting in traditional ways,"" he says. ""But many other parts will be standardised or systematised or made available with online service."" In a previous book Tomorrow's Lawyers, he predicts the creation of eight new legal roles at the intersection of software and law. Many of the job titles sound at home in IT companies: legal knowledge engineer, legal technologist, project manager, risk manager, process analyst.

""Many traditional lawyers will look at that and think: 'Yes, they might be jobs, but that's not what I went to law school for. And that's not what my parents' generation did as lawyers.'"" That, says Susskind, is not his concern: whether we call these new positions lawyers or not, the legal sector will survive.

""What I often say is that the future of law is not Rumpole of the Bailey, and it's not John Grisham,"" explains Susskind. ""It's not a version of what we have today slightly tweaked. It will be people working in the legal sector but offering legal services and legal help in new ways."" It may be the end of the profession as immortalised in courtroom dramas, but as software eats the old jobs it will have to create new ones too.

""Those professions that do not change will render themselves obsolete,"" says Dr Frank Shaw, foresight director at the Centre for Future Studies. ""Those that are able to transform themselves – and I mean 'transform' – will thrive and prosper.""

No one knows for sure what the careers of the future will look like. But the people at the cutting edge are already watching old jobs disappear – and experimenting with the technology that has begun to create new ones. Here's how three of the professions – medicine, architecture and the law – could be transformed, according to the people helping to reinvent them.

THE LAW

'The future of the legal profession is not Rumpole of the Bailey and it’s not John Grisham.’ Photograph: Alexander Kozachok/Getty Images

Five years ago, entrepreneur Charley Moore founded online legal services provider Rocket Lawyer. It now boasts 30 million users. Subscribers pay a monthly fee for instant access to pre‑prepared documents and tutorials, as well as online legal advice from experts at participating firms. The work lawyers on the network do has already begun to resemble the streamlined, one-to-many roles Susskind predicted.

Moore is optimistic about the revolution computerisation has unleashed in his sector. ""I don't think of [software] as consuming the industry, as much as I think of it as supporting the industry. So with software, certainly there are mundane, routine tasks that will become more efficient, but by making those tasks more efficient, lawyers will be able to move up in the food chain and serve millions more legal transactions than they currently can.""

Even judges, he says, will need to move online. ""I think we have to have virtual courts. Australia has been experimenting with them. New York has been experimenting with online parking ticket adjudication. I mean, give me a break, who the heck thinks you should have to go to some government building when you get a traffic ticket? It's incredibly inefficient.""

Such changes would mean fewer lawyers were needed to meet existing clients' needs. But there is an upside: as costs fall and lawyers serve more clients, small businesses and private individuals will suddenly be able to afford legal advice. This is the ""latent legal market"", a disenfranchised horde of potential customers estimated to be worth as much as £27bn. ""There's really an unmet demand for legal services,"" says Moore. ""We need more lawyers, not fewer.""

ARCHITECTURE

‘The cloud means a one-man designer can access the same computing power as big multinationals.’ Photograph: Alamy

Software firm Autodesk, founded in 1982, creates virtual design tools used by millions of architects and designers every day. Last year alone, the company produced revenues of $2.3bn. British vice president Pete Baxter is responsible for its architecture, engineering and construction operations in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

He believes architects have little to fear from artificial intelligence. ""Yes, you can automate. But what does a design look like that's fully automated and fully rationalised by a computer program? Probably not the most exciting piece of architecture you've ever seen.""

Technology won't destroy the profession, but it will, he says, democratise it. ""There's a paradigm shift now: the one-man architect working from home with a bright idea now has access to an infinite amount of computing power in the cloud. That means a one-man designer, a graduate designer, can get access to the same amount of computing power as these big multinational companies. So suddenly there's a different competitive landscape.""

Baxter is keen to highlight the many new opportunities software creates for the savvy architect. Collaboration across continents is growing ever easier, opening up projects all over the world. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater specialisation: the expert in the most minute aspect of design can apply their insight in several countries in the space of a single working day.

""The architectural profession absolutely will still exist,"" he says. ""I think what's happening is we're getting a more collaborative approach. But ultimately somebody still makes the decision.""

MEDICINE

'Where this is going is that, eventually, robots will end up doing surgeries on their own.’ Photograph: Alamy

Dr Pete Diamandis is the chairman and CEO of XPRIZE, a series of competitions that offer $10m awards for inventors who manage to solve some of technology's most vexing challenges. One such prize will be awarded to the first team to produce a working ""tricorder"" – the handheld device used by the medical officers in Star Trek – capable of diagnosing a set of 15 diseases without the presence of a medical professional.

He expects someone to succeed in the next five years. After which, it will only be a matter of time before diagnosis is something done primarily by machines. ""It's a matter of providing the computer with the data. Once it has the data, it's able to consider thousands or millions of times more parameters than a human can hold in their head."" We will still need medical professionals to guide us and provide the human touch – but doctors will have to accept that computers are better at parts of the job than they are.

It's not just software and diagnosis, either: surgeons will have to make way for smarter machines. ""I think we're going to see the role of the physician changing significantly through the use of robotics,"" says Diamandis. He cites the work of Silicon Valley firm Intuitive Surgical, which has created a ""surgical system"" named Da Vinci, which an expert surgeon can control online from anywhere in the world. Just as in architecture, such developments will allow specialists to reach wider markets – but unlike with architecture there is no reason to assume they will stop there.

""Eventually, where this is going,"" says Diamandis, ""is that the robot will end up doing the surgeries on its own. I can imagine a day in the future where the patient walks into the hospital and the patient needs, say, cardiac surgery, and the conversation goes something like this: 'No, no, no, I do not want that human touching me. I want the robot that's done it 1,000 times perfectly.'""

Yet, despite the large parts of the role that technology will take from them, he does not expect a collapse in our demand for doctors any time soon – largely because we already need so many more than we have. In the US alone, for example, experts predict a shortage of up to 91,500 physicians by 2020. ""And that's low compared to the rest of the world,"" he says. ""Africa, which has 25% of the disease burden, has 1.3% of the health workers. There's no way to ever build enough medical schools or teach enough physicians for the demand that exists even today.""

""It's about the economics,"" explains Diamandis. The software and robots are already here – or well on their way – but this unmet demand will remain until the tech is not only more effective but cheaper than the equivalent doctor. ""I call this process the 'dematerialisation of technology'. You used to buy a GPS, you used to buy a camera, you used to buy records. These things which were physical have dematerialised on to your phone, and de-monetised, becoming effectively free. And finally they democratise. Healthcare is undergoing the same process: dematerialisation and democratisation.""","Robot doctors, online lawyers and automated architects: the future of the professions?",http://www.theguardian.com,"[Robert Llewellyn, Tom Meltzer]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402676417721/Robot-gestures-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=9d0144acb2ac30ee67e49b304e882810,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/15/robot-doctors-online-lawyers-automated-architects-future-professions-jobs-technology

Affronted by surly children texting or playing games at the dinner table rather than joining the family banter? DinnerTime aims to help, albeit by the somewhat draconian method of locking a child’s device for a set period of time. It can also be used for bedtime, revision-time or any other time you deem necessary.



Spydy Contacts (Free + IAP)

Spydy is apparently a “social launchpad and people organiser” – presumably for people whose social life remains defiantly land-bound and whose friends are un-organised. It promises a visual revamp of your contacts app, puling in Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, with group messaging included.



Peugeot Music (Free)

The challenge of “music discovery” – helping people find new songs or rediscover old favourites in streaming music services – is being talked about a lot in the music industry. How about help from… Peugeot? Yes, the carmaker has its own music app, offering a curated selection of streaming tunes.



TCS SocialSoccer (Free)

More World Cup – well, it is the week for it – with this app offering scores and stats, but with just as much focus on tweets about prominent teams and players. It’s also claiming to throw in some “big data analytics” to keep you posted on Twitter sentiment around the tournament. If it works, it could be fun.



Talking Progress (Free)

Finally, an app designed for adults suffering from depression. The idea being that you can record your feelings in a digital diary, helping you track the condition and discuss the results with your doctor. There’s also a medicine-reminder alarm built in, if that’s of use.



Angry Birds Epic switches bird-flinging for roleplaying game (RPG) action.

GAMES

Angry Birds Epic (Free + IAP)

The latest Angry Birds game sees no physics-based flinging. Instead, it’s a roleplaying game (RPG) that sees you building up a team of birds and attacking pigs through other means. Along the way, you craft and upgrade weapons, learn new skills and get to grips with its turn-based battles system.



VVVVVV (£1.99)

Ever played Super Hexagon? This is the new game from its developer Terry Cavanagh, and if anything is picking up even more buzz. It’s a platform game that’s been available since 2010 on other devices, with graphics reminiscent of the 1980s, and gameplay that grips you quickly then won’t let you go.



Band Stars (Free + IAP)

As someone who happily wasted many hours on a game called Rock Star Ate My Hamster as a child, I’ve always thought the music industry makes for cracking games. Band Stars is the latest attempt to prove the theory right: a fun social game that gets you hiring and firing members and racing up the charts.



King of the Course Golf (Free + IAP)

EA knows a thing or two about golf games from its stewardship of the Tiger Woods franchise. Its new mobile game takes a new direction – free-to-play – with famous courses, neat touchscreen controls and, ahem, boosts. Well, there had to be something to justify the in-app purchases, presumably…



Flick Soccer Brazil (Free + IAP)

First of a smattering of football games in this World Cup month. Flick Soccer Brazil comes from developer Full Fat: a new game in its very-good Flick Soccer franchise. You’ll be flicking balls past the goalkeeper or at the crossbar over several modes, even if the inclusion of “Brazilian bikini babes” feels a bit unnecessary.



Great Little War Game 2 (£1.99)

Developer Rubicon Development’s little and big war games have a fervent fanbase on Android, and this latest one looks like it won’t disappoint. It’s another turn-based strategy game where you take your troops into battle over 60 missions. “Just jump in and start shooting,” advises its Google Play listing. And thankfully, it really is that accessible.



Up, Down, Left, Right (Free)

Up, Down, Left, Right is probably one of the most frustrating games I’ve played on a mobile phone – up there with Flappy Bird – but in a way that means you play it more, not less. It sounds simple: tap the up, down, left, right keys on a virtual keyboard in time to a beat, switching one of them every so often in response to falling keys above. If you don’t throw your smartphone out of the window within 10 minutes, you’ll be hooked.



QuizTix: World Football (Free + IAP)

QuizTix is a new brand of “collectable quiz” games for Android and iOS, with this the third following versions focused on pop music and movies. Here, you’ll be answering football trivia in a range of categories, taking on friends or asking them for help with tricky questions.



Fluid SE (£1.19)

Fluid SE is being described as part racing game, part Pac-Man, which does a good job of describing its charms. There are 40 levels to speed through, collecting dots and avoiding spectres – yep, Pac-Man – with a well-worked star system to grade your times and keep you coming back to improve your score.



CN Superstar Soccer (£1.79)

Finally, one more football game, this one from Cartoon Network. It sees you playing as characters from shows including Adventure Time, Ben 10 and Regular Show. Power-shots, online multiplayer and spiffing visuals make it worth a look for children and parents alike.

iPhone



Line Selfie Sticker (Free)

If you don’t use messaging app Line, or think selfies are silly, this definitely isn’t for you.

Netvibes: a blast from the past for social media veterans.

Something aimed at people in social media-related jobs, then, but keen RSS users may wish to check it out too.

Fitbay (Free)

Sounds like an online auction site for people to flog unused exercise bikes and treadmills, but isn’t. Instead, this is an app aiming to help you find clothes that fit your specific body shape, matching you with the recommendations of people like you around the world. Plenty of potential.

iPhone



Musikki (Free)

Unread is the latest contender on iPad, an elegant full-screen reading app with clever touches including a persistent web browser and detailed accessibility features.

iPad



Top10 Hotels (Free)

“The ULTIMATE hotel booking app,” claims the App Store listing for this, which is quite a claim in a crowded category. What looks interesting here is its tight focus (yes, the top 10 hotels in various cities and destinations) as well as its ability to pull in photos, social network reviews and deals from other booking sites.

Broken Age (£6.99)

Known to many gamers as “that Kickstarter project that raised $3.3m” when it was known as just Double Fine Adventure, it’s since been renamed as Broken Age, and now it’s on iPad as well as computers.

Damn Little Town (Free + IAP)

This “tactical board game” is justifiably causing a stir among mobile gamers this week, with a number of early reviews mentioning it in the same breath as Carcassonne – and if you haven’t played that game, this is high praise. It sees you building a town, placing settlers, then escaping when it gets “corrupted”. It’s very addictive, with a single in-app purchase unlocking the full version.

1289,"Mayor of London sympathetic to complaints of capital's taxi drivers but says any action carries 'risk of a judicial review'

The mayor of London expressed sympathy for the capital's taxi drivers in their fight against American cab-hire app Uber.

Speaking at the launch of the London Tech Week, Boris Johnson told reporters that it would be ""difficult"" for him to ban Uber ""without the risk of a judicial review"", but that he could see the point the taxi drivers were making in their protests earlier in June.

""I think it's a very difficult [question],"" he said. ""We've gone to the high court to get a ruling on this, and the issue is basically: is the driver's mobile in the cab equivalent to a taxi meter? I can see why m'learned friends might think that it is, because it's receiving data about, or it's calculating, the distance and time and the fare.

""And there are other lawyers who say that it isn't, and that was the advice of the counsel to TfL. And so we've got a legal problem.""

London's black cab drivers pushed the capital to a standstill last Wednesday, over Transport for London's refusal to stop Uber using its smartphone app to calculate fares based on distance and time taken – something they say infringes their right to be the sole users of taxi meters in the city.

But other cabbies say that the issue goes deeper than just Uber, and in fact relates to TfL's handling of minicabs in general.

In a blog post last week, driver Richard Cudlip conceded that ""as a trade we failed to get our message across"" but suggested that the real issues are about safety in minicabs, slow issuing (and reissuing) of black cab licences, a failure to prevent minicabs from illegally touting for business, and a lack of space outside key London tourist destinations.

'The truth shall set you free'

Johnson also addressed the recent ruling by the ECJ on the ""right to be forgotten,"" saying he could see how it was ""practically possible"".

""I am on the side, basically, of history, free speech, of people's right to know what's going on in the world, and I think there are worse things in life than to have your Wikipedia entry mildly inaccurate – as mine is, at several crucial points,"" he said.

""The internet is a wonderful thing. It allows us to know what's going on. I don't want to see people effectively going through it to weed out the truth. The truth shall set you free, that is my view.""



On other tech issues, however, Johnson was less forthcoming. Asked if Londoners would see driverless cars on their streets, he said ""You already have driverless cars on the streets of London – parked. And we have no plans to remove them.""

• Uber: the app that is driving London cabbies to distraction",Boris Johnson says Uber ban in London would be 'difficult',http://www.theguardian.com,"[Alex Hern, Victoria Coren Mitchell, Mark Wallace]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402918990410/72b2eb1f-38f1-426c-be99-2336fb19505a-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8ffb410077c88d54e5ced4a23d7302aa,2014-06-16 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/16/boris-johnson-uber-ban-london
1291,"Hackers have demanded a ransom of €30,000 (£24,000) from Domino's Pizza after stealing personal data on more than 600,000 of its French and Belgian customers.

The data was allegedly stolen during a break-in last week, acknowledged by Domino’s France, which saw 592,000 French and 58,000 Belgian customer records exposed.



A posting by the hackers on text-hosting site Pastebin claims that the stolen data includes customers' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, delivery instructions and even favourite pizza toppings.

""Domino's Pizza uses an encryption system for data. However, we suffered a hack by seasoned professionals and it is likely that they could decode the encryption system including passwords,"" admitted the official Twitter account for Domino’s France.

“This is why we recommend that you change your password for security reasons. We strongly regret this situation and take illegal access very seriously.""

'Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us'

The hackers, a group calling themselves Rex Mundi, posted a sample of the stolen user data along with a demand for €30,000 to not publish the full set.

“If you're a @dominos_pizzafr customer, u may want to know that we have offered Domino's not to publish your data in exchange for €30,000,” Rex Mundi posted on Twitter before its account was suspended.

“Domino's Pizza has until Monday at 8PM CET to pay us. If they do not do so, we will post the entirety of the data in our possession on the internet,” the hackers said.

Domino’s Netherlands spokesperson Andre ten Wolde told De Standaard that the company would not be paying the ransom and that financial data had not been stolen.

'Theft of personal information is bad news'

A Domino’s UK spokesperson said that Domino’s France and Belgium are not part of the same franchise group as Domino’s Pizza in the UK, which is operated by Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, which holds the “master franchise” for Domino’s Pizza in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Monaco.

It is currently unknown whether user data from Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Monaco was also compromised.

Domino’s Pizza Group owns and operates the Domino’s Pizza franchises in the UK and Ireland as well as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.

“The data hacking is isolated to the Domino’s franchise in France and Belgium, and no customer credit card or financial information was compromised,"" said a Domino’s Pizza Group PLC spokesperson in a statement emailed to the Guardian. ""Domino’s customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland are not affected by this incident. The security of customer information is very important to us. We regularly test our UK website for penetration as part of the ongoing rigorous checks and continual routine maintenance of our online operations.”

“Once again we have an example of how customer data, if not adequately secured, can fall into the wrong hands,” said David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The fact that credit card details and other financial data weren’t stolen in this case is good, but the theft of personal information is bad news for customers too.”

The Domino’s Pizza break-in is the latest attempt by the hacker group Rex Mundi to extort money from global companies by stealing user data. In 2012, the group stole and published online loan-applicant details from thousands of users from US payday loan company AmeriCash Advance.

Belgian internet hosting company Alfa Hosting became another of Rex Mundi’s victims suffering a break-in this year leading to the names of 12,000 customers being published online.

“One of the possibly more concerning things is that in a copy of the original notice the hacker group published, the passwords appear to be in plain text,"" said Jon French, security analyst at AppRiver. ""It’s possible they cracked or used rainbow tables to get the passwords, but if the passwords were actually stored in plain text, that’s a big no-no on Dominos part.""



'Path of least resistance'

“Cybercriminals are after the money and will follow the path of least resistance to get to it. Usually this means stealing personal data which is often unencrypted and selling it on the black market, or in this case using it for cyber blackmail,” Jason Hart, vice president of Cloud Solutions at SafeNet.

“The latest breach continues to raise public awareness of the need for encryption – not just of financial data, but also wider customer information. Breaches will happen and you can’t stop them. The issue is – are you able to protect your sensitive data when a breach happens?” explained Hart.

Feedly, Evernote and many other sites and online services have recently been targets for extortion, with hackers demanding money to avoid being taken offline by distributed denial of service attacks, which overload the servers of the website or service, preventing users from access it.

“This is slightly different to what we saw last week, when Feedly and Evernote were targeted by DDoS extortion attacks,” explained George Anderson, director of security firm Webroot.

“Usually, organisations that give in and pay are spared being DDoSed – but only because following through with a DDoS attack requires slightly more effort on the hackers’ side, than publishing the data that has already been downloaded.”

“Companies that fall victim to money extortion attacks should under no circumstances agree to play by hackers’ terms,” Anderson said.

1293,"Nikki is unable to use her right arm following an accident, and wants a light machine with a touch-sensitive screen

About six months ago I had an accident, which led to me losing the functionality of my right arm. This is coming back slowly, and I am finally well enough to return to work as a teacher. My work laptop -- it's about six years old -- is too big and heavy to lift and open one-handed, so I have decided to buy myself a new one. I've found touchscreen devices easier than using a mouse. I've spent quite some time researching touchscreen laptops, but with so many out there, I feel I am lost in a minefield. I use my tablet to do most things but find it hard to type long reports. I'm looking for a laptop that has a very responsive touchscreen, is not too big, is light yet sturdy, and has a relatively good battery life. Typing one-handed, I need a keyboard that is not flat. I have looked at convertible tablets but had difficulties attaching the keyboard. I don't have a huge budget, so I am looking for something in the mid-range price bracket. Nikki

If your tablet can do most of the things you need, then the cheapest and simplest option would be to buy a keyboard for it. Tablets put a premium on thinness, so tablet keyboards tend to be thin. However, you can buy a bigger keyboard with proper keys, as long as it works with your device.

This is easy with Windows 8 tablets, which work with the thousands of keyboards that connect either via Bluetooth or a USB/microUSB cable. Android tablets also support Bluetooth keyboards and mice, and some will work with USB keyboards if they support USB On The Go (OTG) adapters. The Apple iPad doesn't have a USB port, but will also work with Bluetooth keyboards.

If your tablet runs Android, look at External Keyboard Helper Pro (£1.85). This supports a lot of different key layouts and lets you configure a keyboard to suit your needs.

At this point, I was going to mention that there are some one-handed keyboards, including the famous FrogPad. If you haven't heard of this, there are some YouTube videos that show it in action, such as FrogPad One-handed keyboard - Overview and demonstration.

However, Lilly Walters, a one-handed typist, says it is much better to use a conventional keyboard. She has developed a system of one-handed touch-typing where you position your fingers over the FGHJ keys. She says she can type at 40 to 85 words a minute. Whether it's worth developing the skill is another matter: it depends how long you think it will be before you are back to two-handed operation. Either way, there are huge benefits from learning to touch-type with two hands, and I assume this applies to one-handed touch-typing as well.

Another alternative would be to buy a version of Dragon's voice recognition software from Nuance. Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 12.0 is cheap at £36.98, with the full Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 12.0 at £90.78.

Windows 8 and tablets

Windows 8 was launched in October 2012 with two distinct modes of operation. First, there's the Start screen, which works as a touchscreen tablet running apps that have been preinstalled or downloaded from the Windows Store. The Start screen also replaces the old Windows menu and search box. (You can do most things in Windows 8 just by typing a few characters or words directly into the Start screen.) Second, there's the Windows desktop, which works like Windows 7. For a guide, watch Scott Hanselman's videos, starting with the fourth (bottom) one on his web page: Three all new Windows 8.1 video tutorials.

To take advantage of the dual nature of Windows 8, most PC manufacturers have produced innovative hybrids that can work either as a tablet or as a laptop or desktop. Some of these are indistinguishable from traditional laptops when the screen is locked into place. A leading example is the Asus Transformer Book T100, which is much like earlier (but more expensive) models running Google's Android. I suspect this is the sort of thing you've tried.

But there are alternatives. There are hybrids that convert from a laptop to a tablet by folding the keyboard back under the screen. There are leading examples in the Lenovo Yoga range. These are easier to operate with one hand. The drawback is that you still have to carry the weight and bulk of the keyboard while operating it in tablet mode. There are also ""pure"" Windows 8 tablets that are sold without keyboards, exactly like Android tablets and iPads. You can use these only as tablets or – as with any tablet – add your own keyboard.

All Windows 8 Windows tablets still run Windows desktop software, but not the ones that run Windows RT. The leading example is Microsoft's Surface RT. RT machines are – like Apple and most Android tablets, and most smartphones – based on ARM processors. These chips cannot run standard Windows software written for Intel x86 processors. This means Windows RT has not been a success. However, Microsoft's RT-based Surface tablets include a free copy of the desktop version of Microsoft Office. If you run Office most of the time, or if your school runs Citrix (which provides access to Windows software on a server), then a Surface RT might be a viable option.

Some Windows tablets also include Wacom-style screens and digitising pens that make them superb for graphic artists. Pens also enable users to annotate documents or handwrite notes into Microsoft OneNote.

Windows 8 tablets

The cheapest and lightest tablets are the ones with 8in screens such as the Toshiba Encore (£179.99 at PC World) and the Dell Venue 8 Pro (£279 from Dell including £24 shipping, or £220 on Amazon.co.uk). Both have WXGA (1280 x 800-pixel) screens. The Toshiba weighs 0.445kg while the Dell weighs 0.39kg. The Dell also has options such as a keyboard cover and an active pen, at extra cost.

Either of these would do what you want, and both can be used with Bluetooth keyboards and mice, and so on. However, you may well feel the screens are just too small, even if you use the Control Panel to make Windows 8 scale things up by 125% or 150%. You should certainly see how Windows 8 desktop programs (not just apps) looks on an 8in tablet before buying one.

The next cheapest option is the old 10.6in Surface RT tablet with 64GB of storage, reduced by £100 to £259. These are superbly made and have good 1366 x 768-pixel screens (the most common format on laptops). Also, they're light by laptop standards at 676g, though as with any tablet, you would have to add the extra weight and cost of a Bluetooth keyboard. (I suspect the special Windows Type cover will be too flat for you.) However, as mentioned, they don't run Windows desktop software, except for the built-in Office.

Moving up to an old Microsoft Surface Pro with a Full HD 1920 x 1080 pixel screen, Intel Core i5-3317U processor and 128GB of storage pushes the price up to £499, without a Type cover keyboard. This is cheaper than a less-powerful 64GB iPad Air (£559), and while it's not the sort of price that appeals to most Windows buyers, it's worth considering for your purposes. The newer Surface Pro 2 costs more, and an improved Surface Pro 3 is due in August.

The 10.8in Dell Venue 11 Pro is another option. However, it only has a quad-core Intel Atom Z3770 processor and the UK price is somewhere north of £500 (I broke Dell's website).

Rotating screens

Lenovo pioneered the idea of rotating the keyboard behind the screen with its Yoga range. Your best bet is probably a £469.99 IdeaPad Yoga 2 with an 11.1in, 1366 x 768-pixel screen. This is thin (11.7mm) and reasonably light (1.45kg) for a laptop with a 2.1GHz quad-core Intel Pentium N3520 processor, 4GB of memory and 500GB hard drive. I'd expect it to compare very favourably with your old work laptop.

There are obviously more expensive versions, going up to the 13.3in Yoga 2 Pro Ultrabook with an Intel Core i7-4500U processor, 8GB of memory, and 256GB SSD (solid-state drive) at £1,199.99. That would be overkill for your purposes.

The new the HP Pavilion x360 range also, as its name suggests, swivels through 360 degrees to work in a tablet format. I've not had chance to try one. Nonetheless, the 11.6in Pavilion x360 11-n010ea has a slower Celeron N2820 processor but otherwise a similar spec to the Yoga 2 for £349.99.

I'm not sure what you consider the ""midrange price bracket"". I reckon it's about £350 to £500 or, pushing it, £599.99. The IdeaPad Yoga 2 fits that at £469.99, though the HP Pavilion x360 is £120 cheaper.

Touch-screen laptops

There are now dozens of touchscreen laptops that run Windows 8 or 8.1. These are not hybrids, and don't turn into tablets. However, I find the touch screen features surprisingly handy for some things, even in laptop mode. Models that are worth a look include the 1.2kg Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 10 with a Pentium N3510 for £329.95 and the 1.4kg 11.6in Asus VivoBook X200 Red with a Celeron 1007U at £259.97. (In this case, the processors run at around the same speed but the 17 Watt dual-core Celeron 1007U uses more power than the 8W quad-core Pentium N3510.)

The IdeaPad Flex 10 is a ""dual mode"" machine because you can put it with the keyboard face down and use it in ""viewing mode"". However, my wife just bought one from John Lewis – she Asked Jack for one that would fit in her handbag and I gave her a shortlist – and it doesn't seem to be a feature she will ever use. Otherwise, the processor scores 5.2 on the Windows Experience Index and it's impressively nippy for such a small, cheap machine.

I suggest you make a similar trip to a large retail store so you can make your own evaluations of the different designs, keyboards, and how sturdy they are. If sturdiness is very important, then the Microsoft Surface is by far the strongest and sturdiest: Microsoft's former head of Windows attached wheels to one and used it as a skateboard. The cheaper laptops, like the Lenovo Flex 10, are not very sturdy, but the Yoga 2 seems solid enough to me.",What's the best touch-screen PC for one-handed use?,http://www.theguardian.com,[Jack Schofield],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/5/1401984405473/be4f942b-f278-4992-96aa-fa1e0200f940-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=1735b318e595612aea1681ef70b04ce1,2014-06-05 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/jun/05/whats-the-best-touch-screen-pc-for-one-handed-use
1295,"I am just about to upgrade from XP Home to Windows 7 Professional and have been thinking about ways of making and keeping the system faster. Putting the operating system on an SSD would be one thing, but how about also having a separate drive for all non-OS installed programs, downloads, and files? Would you recommend this or, indeed, one for programs and related files, and one for other data, such as photographs, audio files, text documents, etc. If so, how should I go about it? Alan

When you're moving to a new PC, or even installing a new operating system, it's important to think about where you are going to store data. This won't necessarily make your PC run any faster. However, it will make it easier for you to keep track of irreplaceable data, and make backup copies.

One of the problems with the DOS-based versions of Windows (95, 98, 98SE, Me) and, to a lesser extent, Windows XP was a tendency to slow down over time, under the weight of accumulated cruft. I used to do a clean reinstallation every 18-24 months. The good news is that Windows 7 doesn't suffer from this problem, or at least, not to a significant extent. I'm running Windows 7 on a laptop and Windows 7 Pro on a desktop, and have not yet needed to reinstall either operating system. (Windows 7 has a Resource Monitor and a Performance Monitor so you can track how it's doing.)

This also means there's not such a big advantage to having your hard drive divided into two partitions, or having two separate drives. In the old days, it was useful to have the operating system and programs on drive C: and all your data on D: because if you wanted to reinstall the OS, you could reformat C: without worrying about losing data. That's still the case, of course, but it's not as important if you don't expect to have to reinstall the OS.

Another advantage of having two drives was that it made backups simpler. Basically, almost everything on C: could be replaced either by reloading programs from disc or by downloading new versions from the net. Almost everything on D: couldn't easily be replaced, such as personal documents and photos, and music files ripped from audio CDs.

I say ""almost everything on C:"" because Microsoft and various software houses don't make it easy. Microsoft stores things on the C: drive under different user account names (C:\users\jack etc), while some programs like to store data in their own directories. This makes sense because the vast majority of PC users don't pay any attention to where and how things are stored, so developers try to organise their data for them. But it means that if you do care, then you have to change each program's default settings to point to the folders you want it to use.

Note that there are privacy implications to moving data. People who have limited or guest accounts on Windows – including children – only have access to their own programs and data on C:, and to common programs. But they can probably access anything on the D: drive, unless you block them.

Partitions, drives and folders

From a software point of view, it doesn't usually matter if you have (a) two separate hard drives, (b) one large hard drive split into two or more partitions, or (c) a separate folder that you use in the same way as a hard drive. From a hardware point of view, having two separate drives provides more resilience: it's unlikely that both the C: and D: drives will fail at the same time. But remember, having one drive with two partitions – also called C: and D: and working as separate drives -- doesn't provide the same resilience. If the physical hard drive fails, then both drives fail. You can copy files from C: to a partition called D: but you still don't have a backup. You only have a backup if you copy the files to one or more external hard drives, and/or an online cloud-based service such as CrashPlan, Backblaze, Carbonite or Mozy.

My current desktop PC has one large (1TB) hard drive. Instead of partitioning it, I created a folder called MAIN, which I use almost exactly like the D: partition pre-installed on my laptop's hard drive. (I have no idea why I picked that name, but the caps make it stand out.) I put all my irreplaceable data in that folder. Obviously, it has a large number of subfolders such as Audio files (for interviews, etc), Documents, Movies, Music, Photographs, Work etc. Each folder has numerous subfolders, to make things easier to find. For example, my Work folder contains a Guardian folder, which has folders for Ask Jack, Netbytes, Obituaries, Technophile and so on.

The main point of MAIN is that I can quickly take a backup of this one 132MB folder, or use FreeFileSync to update the current backup on an external hard drive. It's manageable, so I'm more likely to do it. But what you do will depend on how much data you have, and how often it changes. If you have a large collection of music or video files, you might want to have these in separate folders, outside MAIN (or whatever). This is a particularly good idea if you share these media folders over your home network.

I said ""it doesn't usually matter if you have two separate hard drives"", but sometimes it does. For example, as you suggest, you can put the operating system on an SSD (solid-state drive) and large data files on a traditional hard drive, to take advantage of the SSD's extra speed. However, this is only because SSDs are so expensive. If you could afford a 500GB or 1TB SSD, then you could use that for everything.

Another case is when applications use such large data files that disk throughput makes a difference to performance. For example, professional photo and video editing programs such as those in Adobe Creative Suite have their own ""scratch files"" (temporary disk storage areas) where they store vast amounts of transitory data. Operating systems also have scratch files or ""page files"" such as pagefile.sys in Windows. In this case, you can get better performance if the two scratch files are on different physical hard drives, because that provides up to twice as much throughput to disk.

When rendering high-definition video, you may want to use one hard drive for read operations and caching but use a separate (preferably clean) hard drive for writing the rendered file.

Moving data from C: to D:

One of Ask Jack's frequently asked questions is, to quote a very recent example, ""my C: drive is almost full but D: drive is 95% empty. How do I move programmes etc to D:?"" I've answered this a few times, most recently in When your C: drive is full and D: is still empty… (October 2010) and Can I make space on my computer by moving files from drive C: to D? (January 2013). If you have this problem, please refer to these earlier answers.

If you're setting up a new PC, think about where you're going to store data so that it doesn't become a problem in the future. If you're installing Windows from scratch, this is a good time to consider whether you want to have one large hard drive or divide it into two or more partitions, and if so, how big the partitions should be. Following the change from the old and inefficient FAT (File Allocation Table) system for formatting hard drives to Microsoft's NTFS (New Technology File System), I think it's generally better to go for one large hard drive – unless you have an SSD.",How should I organise my hard drives and data when upgrading Windows?,http://www.theguardian.com,[Jack Schofield],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/11/25/1385411533888/Businessman-using-a-compu-012.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=f8d534693bf785fed95cf1ab37cccd9e,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/jun/13/how-should-i-organise-my-hard-drives-and-data-when-upgrading-windows

THE future looks curvy. A spate of gadgets sporting concave displays has already been launched, and the big manufacturers will soon be hurling yet more TVs and smartphones with curved screens on to the shelves. Rumours continue to swirl that even Apple's forthcoming iPhone 6 will bend to the craze later this year. There's more to the trend than just a novel shape, though. It may be tapping into a deep-seated desire to get away from the hard corners and rectangles that have defined our appliances for decades. The craze for curves is also fueling a search for materials and manufacturing techniques that will help companies exploit it to the full. ""The first adjective used by people to describe curves is 'soft',"" says Oshin Vartanian, a neuroscientist at the University of Toronto, Canada. ""The story about curvature is a real story about emotion in the brain.""

Expect Apple to beat Google to the punch by unveiling its Internet of Things (IoT) strategy on its home front at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference next week in San Francisco. Apple will lay out a plan to connect a plethora of IoT devices -- light bulbs, thermostats, door locks, washing machines, refrigerators -- with iPhone. Apple's iPhone will serve as a screen to set up each of these IoT devices (since some of them are physically too small to have a screen of their own) and automatically connect them to the home network, after which the iPhone becomes the smart home's all-purpose remote control. EE Times has learned that the key to its execution is a wireless chip - WiFi, Bluetooth, or Zigbee - and an MCU, combined with a piece of software that allows each IoT device to be certified as an MFi (Made For iPhone/iPad/iPod) device. The beauty of the scheme is twofold. First, it's simple.

Simple? That's going to disappoint a lot of bloggers.

Motorola, which Google plans to sell, opened the factory in May 2013. A few months later, Dennis Woodside, the handset unit's chief executive at the time, said it would challenge conventional wisdom that manufacturing in the U.S. is too expensive. At its peak late last year, the plant employed as many as 3,800 people, most on behalf of contract manufacturer Flextronics International. Today, the factory employs about 700 workers who assemble high-end Moto X smartphones that are sold in the US, a Motorola spokesman said. Market researcher Strategy Analytics said Motorola sold 900,000 Moto X smartphones world-wide in the first quarter. By comparison, Apple sold 26 million units of its newest iPhone 5S in the same period. ""What we found was that the North American market was exceptionally tough,"" Motorola President Rick Osterloh said in an interview. …Late last year, Motorola began pursuing a new ""value"" strategy to sell smartphones at lower prices than rivals, a strategy Mr. Osterloh said will continue. The smaller profit margins may help Motorola regain market share, though they put more pressure on the company to control costs.

Be interesting to see how Lenovo views the ""value"" strategy. (Subscription required for full story.)

Until relatively recently most in IT looked upon Graphics Processing Units (GPUs[1]) as specialty technology with dozens or hundreds of cores optimized to run complex mathematical modelling and analysis, numerically intense calculations or for driving sophisticated graphics and rendering. In effect GPUs were for where conventional processors did not have the horsepower to solve specific types of 'scientific' problems that could exploit parallel processing. The implicit specialisation that this represented is, however, changing. GPUs are becoming general purpose, with so-called GPGPUs, and these are likely to enter IT's mainstream because of three separate yet coincidental developments which complement each other.

The Nokia Lumia 520 is still the most popular Windows Phone ever. That said, other devices are slowly gaining popularity and eating into the Windows Phone device market share that is commanded by the Lumia 520. About 33.7% of all Windows Phone devices out in public right now are the Lumia 520, followed by the Lumia 625 in the number two position with 6.7% and the Lumia 920 in third with 6.2%. The surprise is the Lumia 521 (exclusive to T-Mobile here in the United States) jumping seven spots to take the number four position with 6.0%.

That's a huge gulf - the Lumia 520 (the low-end phone) has been Nokia's salvation (such as it is). ""Others"" - as in other manufacturers - make up 21.9%. Based on total Lumia shipments since 2010, that suggests there are a maximum of 65m Windows Phone in use.

It looks natural and in keeping with the design and functionality of iOS as it stands today, and looking at ""iOS Block"" for the first time you might be forgiven for thinking it's a leaked feature from iOS 8. The concept works by expanding your fingers on an existing app icon to get a Block with information like weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and music controls. You can then pinch it back to a normal icon, or place it permanently alongside other icons on the home screen. [Designer Jay] Machalani has created three sizes: iPhone, iPad in portrait, and iPad in landscape orientation. You can have multiple Blocks on a home screen, and the iPad versions leverage the additional space on a tablet display.

As the Amazon-Hachette showdown continues to dominate talk at BookExpo America this week, many industry insiders are wondering whether any retail player can challenge Amazon's dominance. Research conducted in March by the Codex Group found that in the month Amazon's share of new book unit purchases was 41%, dominating 65% of all online new book units, print and digital. The company achieved that percentage by not only being the largest channel for e-books, where it had a 67% market share in March, but also by having a commanding slice of the sale of print books online, where its share in March was estimated at 64%. Amazon and Barnes & Noble are the only two book outlets that have a meaningful share of both the e-book and print markets, assets that are becoming increasingly important as book buyers turn more and more to online channels to purchase books. According to the newest figures from Nielsen Market Research, online outlets accounted for 41% of book purchases in 2013, while bookstore chains accounted for 22%.

Anderson had to help out a friend whose PC became infested with adware after they downloaded what they thought was iTunes - via an advert on Google.

Who is to blame for all this? Well, the warning signs may be obvious to those of us in the trade, but frankly it is not that unreasonable to go to your trusted search engine, type in iTunes, and click the download link. The blame is with Google (and Bing) for taking money from these advertisers whose aim is to get to you download their intrusive ad-laden extras. Apple iTunes is free software and you can get it from Apple here. Note that Google is experimenting with removing the address bar altogether, so you can only navigate the web by searching Google (which is what people do anyway). This would make users even more dependent on the search providers to do the right thing, which as you can see from the above, is not something you can count on.

Blame the swaths of 'open web' evangelists at companies like Google, Yahoo, Twitter, and Facebook who — either through naïvety or vested interests — pulled the wool over our eyes by evangelising Open APIs. It was Web 2.0 — with its central axiom that Open APIs would result in an open web — that got us to enthusiastically expend our energies building on closed platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Because, hey, if they have an Open API, they must be open, right? Wrong.

Apple has moved cautiously with iBeacon, in part because it might raise concerns about being tracked. Apple says iBeacon transmitters don't track users, because they only send out a signal, and don't receive information. The technology is in relatively limited use, deployed in many Apple retail stores and some Major League Baseball stadiums. …Here is how the technology works: Transmitters called beacons emit a low-power Bluetooth signal to smartphones within about 500 feet, depending on conditions. Apps are programmed to respond to those signals, so that a retailer can beam a coupon for detergent when a shopper is in the appropriate aisle, for example. By understanding a user's location, apps can begin to guess what users need or want to do next. It opens the door to a world of ""ambient intelligence,"" an industry phrase describing an environment that senses a person's presence and responds accordingly. Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. has installed beacons in London's Heathrow Airport so a passenger's smartphone automatically displays a boarding pass when he approaches the gate or airport security. LabWerk, a Dutch startup, has an app to help drivers navigate parking garages and alert them to empty spots or guide them to their cars.

as cyber security tensions between the US and China ramp up in the wake of Snowden/NSA, the perceived need for domestic operating systems is higher than ever. At a tech conference sponsored by China's Ministry of Telecommunications, Ni Guangnan from the Chinese Engineering Academy said China will kick its dependency on foreign mobile OSes in the next three to five years, according to Techweb. While Ni didn't mention exactly which OS China is pinning its hopes on, the front runner appears to be COS, short for China Operating System. We caught a glimpse of the Android lookalike back in January, but it hasn't been made available to the public yet. It appears HTC is assisting with development, as well.

Doug Smock:

one of the really huge benefits of additive manufacturing is that it can create complex internal geometries, such as cooling channels. But it's expensive. And for mass production, it's way too slow a process to be realistic. And there aren't really that many parts that benefit from its capabilities. Surface finish? Not Class A. Materials costs? Much more than molding grades of plastics or stamping grades of metals. Materials used in many of the technologies are exotic and have limited, if any, functional applications. Stratasys created a neat niche in the assembly market (thinks jigs and fixtures) for its 3D printing systems, which have the advantage of using common plastics. 3D printing works great when there are a lot of design changes and volumes are low. It's the greatest invention ever for prototyping. It works great for dental and some medical applications. It works great for making custom designed, one-off toys and monsters. It works great for custom cranial implants, although many are still machined from stock shapes. Works great for architectural models. Some goofballs are even using cheap 3D printers to make guns. But a manufacturing revolution?

The prototype, which is called Llama Mountain, will be among the thinnest hybrid devices shown by Intel, and will be based on a fifth-generation Core processor, sources familiar with the company's plans said. No more details about the Broadwell chip, or the hybrid's size or weight were shared. The manufacturing problems with Broadwell are a rare misstep for the world's biggest chip maker. Intel typically releases new chips on an annual basis but the multiple problems mark the first major processor delay since the Pentium 4 chip more than a decade ago. Intel has said Broadwell chips will be 30 percent more power-efficient and faster than their Haswell counterparts, and also boast better graphics. Desktop variants of the chip will support new technologies like DDR4 memory, and also have new graphics cores.

Android TV won't be another device, but rather a platform that manufacturers of TVs and set-top boxes can use to bring streaming services to the television. In that way, it is similar to Google TV, the platform the company unveiled at its 2010 Google I/O conference. But while Google TV was focused on marrying existing pay TV services with apps, Android TV will at least initially be all about online media services and Android-based video games. …The big question is whether Google will get consumer electronics manufacturers to support this vision. The failure of Google TV cost the company a lot of goodwill, but the success of Chromecast may have made up for at least some of that.

It's unclear how Chromecast - made by one manufacturer - would make the consumer electronics companies that saw Google TV plummet (and the Nexus Q dumped after being shown off publicly) suddenly feel good.

Why isn't Shaun White wearing Google Glass Oakley Airwaves? I mean, sure his best days as an athlete may be behind him, but dude can still move some product. Heads-up displays inside goggles are already a thing on the slopes and in the half-pipes, and Google could own this niche by throwing enough cash around. And, look, in many cases, you won't be able to get athletes using them in competition. But you know what: Who cares if Lil Wayne is actually wearing Beats in the studio, as long as he's wearing them in public? And similarly, who cares if Tiger can't (or won't) wear them while he's teeing off at Augusta's Amen Corner, as long as he's wearing them on a practice round?

You may not be planning to start your own Pixar competitor any time soon, but if you like the idea of messing around with some of the same software that powered Wall-E, there's a way to do it. And it's actually free. Pixar is giving out a version of its RenderMan software beginning in August, and you can sign up now so you're the first to hear when it's live. The program usually costs $500 per license, so this is the ultimate flash sale. The catch is that the free version of RenderMan is for non-commercial use only. So if Pixar catches you making money off of your Finding Shmemo release, you will get majorly sued.

[In the experiment] Each household received one of four messages: a leaflet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that there had been no evidence linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism; a leaflet from the Vaccine Information Statement on the dangers of the diseases that the MMR vaccine prevents; photographs of children who had suffered from the diseases; and a dramatic story from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about an infant who almost died of measles. A control group did not receive any information at all. The goal was to test whether facts, science, emotions, or stories could make people change their minds. The result was dramatic: a whole lot of nothing.

Changing peoples' minds can be done, but it's really very hard.

(When it says ""market share"" it means installed base.)

167.9m people in the U.S. owned smartphones (69.6% mobile market penetration) during the three months ending in April, up 5 percentage points since January. Apple ranked as the top OEM with 41.4% of US smartphone subscribers. Samsung ranked second with 27.7% market share (up 1 percentage point from January), followed by LG with 6.5%, Motorola with 6.3% and HTC with 5.3%.

Digging into the details shows that essentially nothing is changing, except that Samsung is tightening its grip on the Android market. There are 88.15m Android users (46.5m Samsung), up 5.5m since January; 69.5m iPhone users (up 3m since January), 4.2m BlackBerry users (down 0.75m since January), 5.5m Windows Phone users (up 0.4m since January) and 73.3m featurephone users - who are shifting to smartphones at a pretty constant rate of 1m per month.

Along with the features that were demoed on stage, an iOS 8 graphic displayed some additional functions that went largely under the radar, many of which look quite interesting. For example, iOS 8 will apparently display battery usage by app, a handy feature that will let users monitor the battery drain of specific apps, shutting down those that are drawing too much power. iPads will gain the ability to take Panoramic photos like the iPhone, while the Camera will gain an instant burst mode, a timer mode, and separate controls for focus and exposure. iBooks will support an auto night mode and the ability to organize books by series, while notifications will include travel time.

Also getting some very useful accessibility functions.

The team behind the All in One SEO Pack just released a new version of their popular WordPress plugin. It is a security release patching two privilege escalation vulnerabilities we discovered earlier this week that may affect any web site running it. If your site has subscribers, authors and non-admin users logging in to wp-admin, you are a risk. If you have open registration, you are at risk, so you have to update the plugin now.

Plug-ins seem to be so liable to security problems.

I'm glad video stabilization technology is mainstream now. It's giving us new insight into historical events, opening new perspectives in scientific research, and then there is the endless fun factor—like seeing how ridiculous the battle scenes in Star Trek: The Next Generation are. Enjoy!

The bonus, with a scene from Star Trek (the original series) is definitely worth the clickthrough. Hard to decide whether the prize for ""most ridiculous acting of OMG THE SHIP IS BEING SHAKEN UP"" should go to William Shatner or Nichelle Nichols. Not that the main one, with Captain Pickard, isn't. Acting at its finest.

For a while there it looked like Microsoft would either purchased Barnes & Noble's struggling Nook e-book reader business or partner with the firm to create Windows-based Nooks. But today, Barnes & Noble upended those possibilities in announcing a partnership with Samsung in which the consumer electronics giant will make future Nook tablets. Some may see this as a blow to Microsoft and/or Windows. But I see this as bullet dodged: Let's face it, the last thing Microsoft needed was another money-losing hardware product line. Certainly, for Barnes & Noble, this is a nice out, too, since it really couldn't afford to invest in the hardware lineup.

Post-Heartbleed,, OpenSSL turns out to have another vulnerability, explains Brian Gorenc: .

So, why is this vulnerability interesting beyond just the technical aspects?



According to the commit logs, Robin Seggelmann introduced this vulnerability into the OpenSSL code base four years ago. Yes, Robin Seggelmann is also responsible for introducing the Heartbleed vulnerability. Two big vulnerabilities introduced by the same developer. Seggelmann is not completely to blame, of course. OpenSSL is an open source project. The 'many eyes' that look at this code failed to catch this bug, but a new breed of individuals are looking at this code…especially at Seggelmann's code. This code is now known for having vulnerabilities. There is blood in the water.

Dear Members of the Senate: It's been a year since the first headlines alleging the extent of government surveillance on the Internet. We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But the balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual. This undermines the freedoms we all cherish, and it must change.

Encrypts files on the SD card (if there is one) and demands a ransom:

Android/Simplocker.A will scan the SD card for files with any of the following image, document or video extensions: jpeg, jpg, png, bmp, gif, pdf, doc, docx, txt, avi, mkv, 3gp, mp4 and encrypt them using AES. Android/Simplocker.A will also contact its Command & Control server and send identifiable information from the device (like IMEI, et cetera). Interestingly, the C&C server is hosted on a TOR .onion domain for purposes of protection and anonymity. As you may notice on the nag-screen above, there is no input field for a payment-confirming code of any kind, as we've seen in earlier examples of Windows ransomware. Instead, the malware listens to its C&C server for a command – probably issued after payment is received – to decrypt the files. The sample we've analyzed is in the form of an application called 'Sex xionix'. It was not found on the official Google Play store and we estimate that its prevalence is very low at this time.

[Brad] Soden is the inventor of the Tankchair, which is a wheelchair in the same sense that an aircraft carrier is a boat. His fearsome-looking machine can traverse rugged hillsides, sandy beaches, snowy embankments, and, with a top speed approaching 30 miles per hour, keep up with traffic on a typical city street. Its brain is built by a company that designs Apache helicopter control systems, so the chair can elevate to a standing position or fully recline to aid blood flow. Some versions have gun mounts and fishing reels. Some have roll bars. A few glow in the dark. One chair Soden built for a paralyzed Phoenix police officer has a ""vomit light"" to neutralize suspects—a pulsing LED so powerfully incapacitating that it induces nausea. If Michael Bay had devoted himself to making medical equipment instead of action movies, this is what he would have built.

Can't decide if that's a good or bad thought. But the story is inspiring.

That's Google's Project Tango:

Game developers could, for example, use it to paint a 3D virtual battlefield in your living room. Or create large scale virtual and augmented reality experiences. Real estate companies could build interactive, 360-degree ""fly-through"" tours. Interior designers could scan a client's home and test design ideas, such as moving walls or inserting furniture. Retailers can guide the user to specific places or products. All these applications are a perfect match for general purpose GPU computing, which takes the parallel architecture of GPUs and puts it to work solving some of the world's toughest problems. And because our Kepler GPU architecture is already used in PCs, workstations, and supercomputers, the tools needed to put Tegra K1 to work are already here.

there's a deeper and older dynamic starting to come into play now. Apple invented the smartphone as we know it 7 years ago and since then the concept has been built out. All the stuff that really should have been there has been added step by step by both Apple and Google, and the pace at which essential improvements are made is starting to flatten out. But as that happens, the two platforms start to converge. Copy & paste is copy & paste, but iBeacon is a very Apple sort of idea, just as Google Now is a very Google product. That is, as the core features are built out and commoditised, the changes are coming more and more in ways that reflect the very different characters of Apple and Google.

This difference in approach is pulling in entirely different directions, though.

Jan Dawson:

To suggest that Apple is trying to ""win"" in the messaging wars is equivalent to suggesting that iTunes was an attempt to ""win"" in the music-playing software wars. Neither is the case. The first thing to understand about Apple is that it's motivated first and foremost by creating the best possible experience on Apple devices. This imperative drove Steve Jobs to the extent that he made poor business decisions early on in his time at Apple, ultimately leading to his ouster. He was so fixated with this objective that he lost sight of others and ultimately of what it would take to keep Apple in business as a public company, a lesson he learned the hard way and ultimately brought back to Apple when he returned. But that has always been the fundamental motivation for Apple's senior leaders above all else.

Also takes in the potential model for Amazon, if it does a smartphone. Educative.

Fred Wilson (whose venture capital company has invested in DuckDuckGo):

assuming that Google's search volume keeps growing at 15% per year, DuckDuckGo would be doing 1.7% of Google's daily search volume in three years. So there is certainly a market out there for people who will accept a slightly weaker product in exchange for privacy. It's not 25% of the market. It may not even be 5% of the market. But I believe it is well north of 1% of the market. And if that is the case, are there other big product categories out there other than search where privacy could be used as a competitive vector? How about email? How about messaging? How about maps? How about browsers? I think we are going to see this play out in the coming years. DuckDuckGo is making it work. Why won't others do the same?

Surprising that Wilson hasn't noticed other companies already emphasising privacy in their products such as email, messaging, maps and browsers.

Users, according to our information, will also be able to choose who (and presumably what) they are visible to. This will limit the ways that Nearby can automatically interact on a user's behalf. While it's still early in its life cycle, and settings don't appear to be fully built out yet, it's easy to imagine Nearby coming in handy for extremely targeted Wallet offers, reminders, or other location-based interactions, but the important part here is that a user wouldn't need to interact with their phone or tablet to let other devices (be they mobile or otherwise) know they are around, and switching on Nearby once would allow the functionality to work with all of a user's devices. This would open up the possibility of automated functionality in tons of spaces beyond the commercial world, from home automation to everyday user-to-user interaction, to the interaction between your own devices. This is especially interesting in light of Apple's recent announcement of Continuity, an iOS and OS X feature that allows Apple-made devices to interact with each other in really smart ways automatically, based on proximity.

Basically, the same sorts of functions as iBeacon. Disquieting, however: ""When Nearby is turned on for your account, Google can periodically turn on the mic, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and similar features on all your current and future devices."" Remotely turn on the microphone? All your current devices? All your future devices?

What I have found very frustrating is that I haven't been able to define what is acceptable in a manner that comes anywhere close to the importance I think this topic demands. Too often I am left with just an I'll know it when I see it definition. With that in mind I present a game that I came across this evening. I think it perfectly encapsulates the positive side of the issue in a way that is hopefully instructive to showcase. The game in question is FlappyGolf.

Sameer Singh:

While market share of shipments is certainly a leading indicator for install base (and consequently, usage), it only gives us a part of the story. Contrasting regional market share and usage share (as a proxy for install base) may give us an even better understanding. As always, I've sourced the figures for shipment market share from Kantar while usage share figures are from Statcounter. Usage share (or browsing share) isn't an ideal proxy for install base as it could be skewed towards higher end devices. However, the trends in usage share could give us a fairly good understanding of the underlying install base.

At the core of such tracking is the MAC address, a unique identification number tied to each device. Devices looking for a Wi-Fi network send out their MAC address to identify themselves. Wireless routers receive the signals—and addresses—even if a connection is never made. Companies like Euclid or its peer Turnstyle Solutions use the data to track footfall in stores, how people move about in shops, how long they linger in certain sections, and how often they return. Store-owners use the information to target shoppers with offers (paywall) or to move high-value items to highly-trafficked parts of the shop, among other things. Even though stores may not mine this data to try to identify individuals, there are plenty of legitimate privacy concerns about the data collection, especially since people tend to be unaware that it is happening. Apple's solution, as discovered by a Swiss programmer, is for iOS 8, the new operating system for iPhones which will be out later this year, to generate a random MAC addresses while scanning for networks.

""Dr Drang"":

As an engineer, I can't forget that design is how it works. When I was in college, I took seven design courses: steel design, advanced steel design, reinforced concrete design, advanced reinforced concrete design, prestressed concrete design, timber design, and a ""capstone"" design course that was intended to pull together what I learned in all the others. Now, when I need to analyze a structure or a piece of equipment, I ask for the design drawings. In my world, design is what engineers do to make things work. The software world, on the other hand, has this weird dichotomy between what it calls ""engineers"" and what it calls ""designers.""

Kate Crawford:

The current mythology of big data is that with more data comes greater accuracy and truth. This epistemological position is so seductive that many industries, from advertising to automobile manufacturing, are repositioning themselves for massive data gathering. The myth and the tools, as Donna Haraway once observed, mutually constitute each other, and the instruments of data gathering and analysis, too, act as agents that shape the social world. Bruno Latour put it this way: ""Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them."" The turn to big data is a political and cultural turn, and we are just beginning to see its scope. But what do you do when you realize that all that data is not enough? From the Boston bombings to Malaysian Airlines flight 370, we know that data black holes exist. Even when there were direct tip-offs about the Tsarnaevs, the data didn't set off the right red flags. These moments demonstrate why the epistemic big-data ambition — to collect it all — is both never-ending and deeply flawed.

This is the essay that was referred to by John Naughton in his piece on Sunday.

Well, there's apparently one good thing Microsoft's Windows is good at: running the software necessary to manufacture Apple's Mac computers. And the messenger of this information? Apple chief executive Tim Cook himself. On Thursday, Cook tweeted a photo of himself touring Apple's Austin, Texas production line where the Apple Mac Pro is manufactured. The problem? Right behind Cook is an iMac—and it's clearly running Windows.

1307,"Last week, I followed a link to Never try to do what I’m doing, an exhausted and dispirited post from one of the more interesting people in my extended social circle: Leila Johnston, a freelance writer who used her three-month residency at Brighton's Lighthouse Studio to launch Hack Circus, a nearly indefinable magazine and event-series and podcast devoted to weird things that attempt something I can best describe as ""serious delightfulness"".

Some of Johnston's best-known work is her comedy – I loved her 2009 book Enemy of Chaos, a choose-your-own-adventure book about gaming and nerdiness; you might also know her her Shift Run Stop. Now she’s walking a razor-edge line between art and commerce, integrity and realism, and criticality and whimsy. The second issue of the improbable and beautiful Hack Circus magazine just shipped. On that august occasion, I asked Leila if she would let me interview her for this column:

Q. Is it fair to call Hack Circus ""an effort to find a business-model for idle, useless, diversion?"" That is, are you looking for a way to make just fooling around and being silly into a sustainable practice?

A. I don't think there's anything idle about it – the ideas are challenging and the overall editorial message of pushing your understanding of what is real and what can be trusted, is highly critical. In contrast to a commercial world where tech, art and design have to appropriated into utility and capitalist service, it is in part a useless, or ""art"" case for tech projects. But it's no more useless than any other entertainment and a good deal more informative than most.

The opposite of useful is not always useless, as such. The opposite of reportage is not always silliness, and the opposite of consumer messaging is not always fooling around. Playboy is one of the most successful media enterprises of all time, so presumably people don't want entertainment for functional reasons. Perhaps fooling around can be a very effective business model.

The events are fun, but they are reality-distorting rather than ""comedy"". They are funny because the clever, strange people who like Hack Circus are naturally funny and have done such wonderfully surprising things, not because they've written a routine. I don't want to do a science comedy night for sceptics and atheists – there's plenty of that around. I'm far more interested in, and identify far more strongly with, the credulous than the sceptical, and I'm consciously working against the resistance to imagination that scepticism presents.

Q. Is Hack Circus ""living like it was the first days of a better nation"" in which you can woo the muse of the odd not in spite of the fact that there's no money in being weird and speculative, but because of that fact?

A. You know, I'd love for that to be the case. I'm conflicted because I need both sides. I heard a charity campaigner saying her business was other people's pain. Without the poison industry, you can't have the antidote business. I need there to be a fringe or underworld, because that's where Hack Circus comes from – that's where I live – but I also need an establishment to react to. Rightly or wrongly, the inside helps us to contextualise those inherent outsider feelings we've always had…

Content is very easily appropriated, no one reads anything properly – as you said, people don't have time. People certainly don't have your best interests at heart; whatever you say they will take from it what suits them. But there is something beyond content that may have a hope of leading a change: its container. Digital culture has created a new outsider: there is a new sense of statement about an object. Nowadays it is so expensive and weird to make media in the real world that an object has to have a point. That's why print design is so much more beautiful and complete than web design; it's not the fault of web designers, who are ingenious within their extraordinary constraints. But websites are so enormously compromised, so crushingly shareable on every level, every pixel, that it is much harder to allow digital the basic privilege of its own voice. In short, I think we might be able to use the physicality of magazines and events to gain a bit of ground that has been lost by digital because the meaning of physicality has changed.

Q. I always thought that the thing that made zines so valuable while they lasted was that they were uncommodifiable in that a trained commercial designer would probably rather gouge her out eyes out before making things that were that heroically ugly (at least until a new generation of designers emerged from zine culture). The same was true for Geocities pages and Myspace pages.

One problem with ""bohemian"" projects is that they can be moved from the underground to the high street in seconds. How do you put a defensive ring around your noncommercial, anti-utilitarian technology?

A. I think a lot of ziners would argue their work is/was a kind of artful ""poverty design"" – the beauty and ingenuity of making do with what you have, and I absolutely appreciate that and can relate to it with Hack Circus. And I agree that the Myspace and Geocities days were definitely the inheritors of that spirit. But the fact it looks like a style (even an ugly one) means it looks like a dream, and the resulting glorification of amateurism and its associated poverties comes with a danger. Because it reinvents quality along lines that have no external measure, and in doing so devalues everything, including itself. Websites used to be something people visited, left a note on, and left. The reader had limited agency, and we were constantly aware there was an invisible barrier between author and reader; that the internet was a series of destinations, not just a flip book with us at the middle of every page.

I think the almost comically extreme trend towards online shareability is partly about our desperation to be noticed by anyone, now that the internet is so crowded.

To meet people halfway means finding a common language, and beautiful, evocative design is one way to do that very quickly. I believe it's a lot easier to achieve that connection through print, paradoxically because it slightly pushes the viewer into a role – it sets them back into a read-only mode. So I think physical magazines are conversational, but in a slightly more subtle way. I mean, people absolutely love magazines. And advertisers love what people love, and that's why mags have weathered the rise of digital better than newspapers. Beautiful magazines arrive like magic in the world, especially ones which come through your letterbox. Online magazines are not just 'magazines on a screen', they are a totally different beast – they're less magical, less personal. You know everyone else is looking at your dream at the same time. You can see them being constructed in front of you, and that's a different kind of voyeurism.",Leila Johnston: 'Digital culture has created a new outsider',http://www.theguardian.com,[Cory Doctorow],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402663934017/89ed2f16-622d-47df-93e7-27df767a007a-620x372.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=9e4d74274b14156a7f4beb525f329ff9,2014-06-13 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/13/leila-johnston-digital-culture-hack-circus

The deal is a major victory for Powermat and the Power Matters Alliance, which remains embroiled in a standards war with the Wireless Power Consortium, purveyor of the Qi charging standard. And at least right now, we're at something of a stalemate. Qi's technology has been embedded into the design of far more smartphones, including the new LG G3, Nexus 5, and numerous Nokia devices. PMA's wireless charging solution hasn't enjoyed the same adoption among manufacturers; most people still need to buy a compatible case for their phone before ditching the USB cable that came with it. But Schreiber suggested the tide is turning. Consumers can buy PMA-compatible back covers for some Samsung smartphones that enable Powermat charging, and Apple — which hasn't officially picked a side in this battle — sells a Duracell Powermat iPhone case at its retail stores. ""Devices will come out with compatible technology, and we'll see an industry that's been hamstrung a bit with standards issues and conflicting implementations coalesce a common ground,"" [Powermat president Daniel] Schreiber said. If you don't own a supported device, you'll be able to purchase a tiny, inexpensive receiver ""ring"" that plugs into your phone and lets you toss it onto the pad for recharging. (Schreiber wouldn't reveal whether Starbucks plans to sell these directly.)

Wonder why Starbucks would start rolling out wireless charging in mid-year using a standard that's not used on many smartphones at present.

Hi - I was wondering why all of Amazon's Knights of Sidonia volumes are now restricted to only Kindle devices, as opposed to the Kindle app for iOS or the cloud-based e-reader. Over the last few months, I've bought and read through volume 5, but now I can't continue my collection because I don't own a Kindle.

vertical-inc replied:

That's Amazon's choice. We would never have them restricted to specific machines. (Actually our novels are on all Kindle platforms and our first eBooks were also, but Amazon changed those policies themselves for whatever reasons).

Seems incredible that Amazon would cut off ways for people to consume content bought from it. It's like declining to sell boo....

Nintendo's announcement at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles didn't really tackle the basic problem the gaming-console pioneer faces: Nintendo's customers are giving up on the Wii. Unlike the PlayStation and the Xbox, Nintendo's Wii has long catered to younger users who like the company's cartoon characters, most notably Mario. As the cost of smartphones and tablets continues to fall, however, parents are less willing to fork over several hundred dollars for a Nintendo Wii U when they can instead let Junior play a few online games, often for free, on a cheap Android device. Nintendo executives ""seem to think that the issue is the lack of games,"" Amir Anvarzadeh, a BGC Partners analyst in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television today. However, ""the real issue here is that Nintendo is focusing on the casual gamers, [while] the gamers are migrating to smartphones and tablet platforms where games are free.""

Nintendo, you have a problem.

Let me just explain one little bit of Taxi/PH [private hire] law first; as a Taxi driver (because of the extra training that allows me to accept instant hails) I am allowed to take bookings direct, unlike a PH driver who must accept a booking from a PH Operator like Addison Lee. This is why what Hailo do (connect me to a punter direct) is within the law and what Uber do isn't. As previously stated, PH cars are not allowed to make themselves ""available for immediate hire"" and again, this is what Uber are doing and therefore breaking the law. Then there is the issue of their ""virtual meter"". The law states that a PH vehicle is not allowed to be equipped with a meter. Uber, with TfL's blessing, argue that a smartphone isn't a meter. I think most right minded people would think that if it does the same thing as a meter, then it most probably is a meter. And an important point here is that Taxis are made to have meters fitted to protect the public from being ripped off. …There are also issues around Uber not asking for destinations (required by law) and Uber not having an operating center in the UK, but in Holland. This final point seems to be the only one that TfL are admitting is a problem and that if they'd known about it before may not have issued their operator licence! …what Uber and Hailo really want is to take a big cut of the multi billion pound taxi market. Do they have drivers interests at heart? Definitely not. Do they even have customers interests at heart? Almost certainly not. What they really want is to resell my work to me for a fee. Isn't technology wonderful?

Beyond the fact most of us had nothing better to do in the 1980s, a big reason to own a gaming console was that they were a phenomenally good deal. In 1985 Nintendo introduced the Famicom to North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System for a mere $199, an remarkably low price considering the average PC cost around $2,400.1 While PC prices soon began to fall, the Playstation/Nintendo 64 generation was still nearly $1,500 cheaper than the average PC. Over the last two generations of consoles, however, prices have actually risen, and today a Playstation 4 or Xbox One is nearly the same price as an average PC. In some respects, this makes no sense: why hasn't Moore's law had the same impact on consoles as it has had on PCs? Moreover, when you consider that consoles now compete with a whole host of new time-wasters like phones, tablets, social networks, dramatically expanded TV offerings, the Internet, etc., it's downright bizarre. I think the answer lies in a specific part of disruption theory. Specifically, incumbents are driven by their best customers to add more and more features that drive up the price, causing the incumbents' product to move further and further away from the average customer's needs (needs which have actually been decreasing as more entertainment options become available):

Once that happens, all sorts of strange things become possible. And why not an Android TV that could serve gamers? Though of course Sony already seems to have thought of this.

Kurzweil is also known as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of ""the Singularity"" - when computers encapsulate or surpass human intelligence:

I have had a long-term wager with Mitch Kapor in which I predicted that a computer program would pass the Turing test by 2029 and he predicted that this would not happen, see links below. This was the first long-term wager on the ""Long Now"" website. The bet called for $20,000 to be donated from us to the charity of the winner's choice. As a result, messages have been streaming in from around the world congratulating me for having won the bet. However, I think this is premature. I am disappointed that Professor Warwick, with whom I agree on many things, would make this statement. There are several problems that I describe below, including a transcript of a conversation that I had with Eugene Goostman, the chatbot in question.

This is going to be a great disappointment to all the imaginary 13-year-old Ukrainian boys with passable English who are rude about their female classmates.

One Reddit user built a program with Leap Motion's to browse articles with one-finger swipes left and right, or upvote articles with two finger motions. Though, in watching his video, other than the novelty, it's tough feel a huge improvement over using a mouse and keyboard. But on the other hand, it's hard not to think of an extremely rudimentary version of the screens in Minority Report. Time will tell. Leap Motion has been pushing the next generation of its tracking software, improving motions like touching one finger to another hand, or pinching two fingers together. Those seem like simple motions. But if a game requires a player to, say, pick up a ball and throw it, the sensors require incredible precision to know the exact moment the player's hand would have wrapped around and made a grip on the sphere - not to mention when they've released it.

Leap Motion is clever, but still very much a technology desperately seeking an application.

Mike Barry and Brian Card:

Boston's Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) operates the 4th busiest subway system in the U.S. after New York, Washington, and Chicago. If you live in or around the city you have probably ridden on it. The MBTA recently began publishing substantial amount of subway data through its public APIs. They provide the full schedule in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format which powers Google's transit directions. They also publish realtime train locations for the Red, Orange, and Blue lines (but no Green or Silver line until 2015). The following visualizations use data captured from these feeds for the entire month of February, 2014. Also, working with the MBTA, we were able to acquire per-minute entry and exit counts at each station measured at the turnstiles used for payment. We attempt to present this information to help people in Boston better understand the trains, how people use the trains, and how the people and trains interact with each other.

Simply fantastic visualisation; set time aside to read and play with it. Bonus: you'll learn what a Marey diagram is, if you don't already know.

A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team

Robinson Meyer:

Skybox's success doesn't depend on it developing a perfect image-evaluation algorithm. It merely depends on another developer using its cloud to develop an algorithm. Now it joins Google. The advertising giant might use the small satellites in its quest for more and faster data for its Maps and Earth services. The company, however, gets its truly high-resolution imagery from DigitalGlobe, and it negotiated its last ""multiyear agreement"" with the satellite behemoth in February. Owning satellites of its own might help Google when it negotiates its next contract with DigitalGlobe, but that's now a few years off. (Whatever happens in the world of small satellites, by the way, the military will still pay for access to DigitalGlobe's enormous WorldView craft. That doesn't mean its stock hasn't responded to the news.) No, it seems possible Google bought Skybox for two reasons.

Our new information surrounding Quantum is refreshing. There has been a lot of confusion over the past months about interface leaks and updates, with many questioning why Google isn't remaining consistent and resolute in its design guidelines for Android. Having seen Quantum Paper, however, it is clear that not only is Google looking to be more consistent in Android design, but they are planning to provide all the pieces necessary to third party developers, and make this new interface approach consistent not just on its mobile operating system but across its web properties and perhaps more interestingly, iOS as well. The potential here is large. You wouldn't be mistaken to think of Quantum as a sort of broad-sweep replacement for Holo, but it's even more powerful than that. The framework will include interface, motion, and interaction (as stated before) on all platforms, making for not just clearer and more consistent UI but also a more consistent user experience.

Sean Heber points out that iOS 8 brings lots of changes. Apple TV wasn't mentioned in the WWDC keynote. But it has gained lots of little extras - building blocks?

Due to AirPlay now supporting peer-to-peer connections, this means that if you bring your iPhone or iPad with you to a friend's house (or anywhere with an AppleTV such as a hotel room, school, etc), and you have all of your games in your pocket but can play them on the nearby screen if you want. You can play without needing to purchase the game on that particular AppleTV, without needing to sign in with your iCloud account to access your purchases, without needing to get their wifi password, or indeed without there even needing to *be* a wifi network to join in the first place. All without any hassle. When you go home, you take the game and any earned progress along with you in your pocket.

Marc Andreessen:

Progressive and smart economist Jared Bernstein has explored the productivity puzzle of robots eating all the jobs (or not). He points out that productivity growth was up 1% last year, and has averaged 0.8% since 2011. But what he really focuses on is the smooth trend that tracks through the numbers. The trend suggests that the pace of productivity growth has decelerated since the first half of the 2000s. That begs an important question that the robots-are-coming advocates need to answer: Why a phenomenon that should be associated with accelerating productivity is allegedly occurring over a fairly protracted period where the [productivity] trend in output per hour is going the other way? My own take. We're still coming out of a severe macroeconomic down cycle, the credit crisis, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap. The prevailing pessimistic economic theories — the death of innovation, the crisis of inequality and yes, robots eating all the jobs — will fade with recovery.

Brad Greenberg, intellectual property fellow. Columbia Law School:

assuming Tesla offers nothing more than a public promise not to sue ""good faith"" users, this announcement may be of little social benefit. Worse, it seems to me that such public promises could provide a new vehicle for trolling. Sure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents—though estoppel requires reasonable reliance and this announcement is so vague that it's difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable—and Tesla isn't in the patent trolling business anyway… But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: IBM now appears to be claiming the right to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick."") The questions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will have to answer them.

Logically, Tesla is making this promise about its patents because its business doesn't depend on its patents.

Carolina Milanesi:

The big source of buzz about the iPhone 6 is its larger screen size-the lack of which, many experts speculate, has caused Apple to lose appeal and customers over the past year. Kantar Worldpanel ComTech data, however, tells a different story when it comes to the US market. When looking at the US consumers who upgraded their devices over the past year, only 14% of iPhone users moved from Apple to Android, and of those, only 2.1% opted for a screen of 5.5 inches or larger. Chinese consumers have turned to larger screen sizes over the past year, so it is no surprise that these numbers are higher: Among consumers who upgraded their devices over the past year, 39% left iOS for Android. Of those, 12.3% opted for a screen of 5.5 inches or larger. The potential upside of moving to a larger screen is certainly considerable for Apple in China, with customers to be retained and won over, but the impact will not be lost in the US, either.

The gap between expert - or ""expert"" - speculation and consumer behaviour is often telling. The article has some fascinating statistics too about ownership movement between Samsung and Apple.

Next time someone demands your digits and you want to get out of the situation, you can give them this number: (669) 221-6251. when the person calls or texts, an automatically-generated quotation from feminist writer bell hooks will respond for you. protect your privacy while dropping some feminist knowledge when your unwanted ""suitor"" calls or texts.

|Pitted a black cab (via Hailo), Addison Lee and Uber, from the WSJ Europe offices in Fleet Street to the Shard.

Uber's driver wasn't familiar with The Shard, a towering glass structure that is one of the most recognizable landmarks in London. The driver took a different route from the other two, which ended up taking twice as much time. The fare was 60% more than the other trips because of a premium Uber charges for busy times.

Slower and more expensive? What's not to love?

As a biomedical computing student at Queen's University seven years ago, Justin Lee knew he wanted to build his own ""internet of things"" device — but he didn't want it to be any old ""smart"" lamp, toaster, or light switch. ""I wanted to put a computer into one of the most ubiquitous objects in the history of the human race,"" he says. He chose the cup. Then, he enlisted Yves Béhar, the esteemed designer behind Jawbone and the OLPC, to build it. The result is Vessyl, a 13-ounce cup that recognizes any beverage you pour into it, displays its nutritional content, and syncs all your drinking habits to your smartphone. Let's cut to the chase: while I only had an hour with a Vessyl prototype, I tried nearly a dozen beverages in it — and it successfully identified all of them. Within 10 seconds, the device, which currently resembles more of a Thermos than a finished product, recognized Crush orange soda, Vitamin Water XXX, Tropicana orange juice, Gatorade Cool Blue, plain-old water, and a few other beverages, all by name. Yes, this cup knows the difference between Gatorade Cool Blue and Glacier Freeze.

The internet of drinks! Now if it could identify contaminants - or whether someone had spiked your drink - that would make it a lot more interesting.

1317,"New weapons, new courses, end-of-race highlights and an ice-cold Luigi. How are you finding Mario Kart 8?

Mario Kart 8 has been out in the UK for a few weeks now, leading to a large increase in sales for the Wii U console. It's even seen the birth of its own meme: the Luigi death stare, a celebration of the lesser-heralded Mario brother's ice-cold reaction to the administration of shell-based justice.

I spent the weekend getting to grips with the latest Mario Kart iteration, sunny weather eschewed in favour of relentless four-player action.

Early impressions are positive. The karts drive, glide and slide like a dream, and as our review points out, the new weapons are a satisfying addition. And there are little pleasing tweaks that make logical sense: if you plunge off the course into a cute ravine, lakitu returns you to the track much more efficiently than before, power-up boxes reappear a touch more quickly, and there is now a means of combatting the blue shell. At last.

James Walsh (@jamesofwalsh) Whacking juanpenguino in Mario Kart 8 https://t.co/q9CAHb7ug5

And, as the Luigi death stare indicates, the end-of-race highlights (which you can edit and upload to Youtube) are an absolute joy. We almost enjoyed watching each hit, in glorious high-def slow-mo, as much we enjoyed playing the game itself.

As many have mentioned, the only bugbear is battle mode, which now takes place on the standard courses rather than ready-made arenas, and this is a real step backwards. ""I can't find anyone,"" and ""it's taking ages, isn't it?"" were standard responses when we tried it.

Now it's over to you. How are you finding Mario Kart 8? Is it the best one, or do you still pine for the SNES or the underrated Game Cube versions? Share your thoughts - and links to your own killer videos, if you've made any - in the thread below.

1325,"As the FIFA World Cup heads to Brazil, its worth remembering that not everyone gets applauded for playing the game in a country where it was once illegal for women to kick a football, says Jo Griffin

Brazil, the land of football, is no country for women players. It’s hard to believe but many women still face a fight to play the game let alone enjoy the rewards reaped by the men. So routine has been the mockery and marginalisation of female footballers that visiting fans might be forgiven for overlooking them entirely. But not during a World Cup that’s putting Brazilian society under intense scrutiny.



Yesterday, FIFA’s five-times woman player of the year, Brazilian Marta Vieira da Silva, opened the Football for Equality Plaza in Rio de Janeiro, a space dedicated to providing an insight into how football can spur emancipation and social change, for the duration of the World Cup.

The focal point is the exhibition Women on The Pitch, which details 100 years of women’s football in Brazil, “a century-long struggle for acceptance and respect on and off the pitch”, said organiser Niko Wieland.

“Marta”, known in Brazil as “Pele in a skirt”, herself left Brazil for Sweden because opportunities lacked at home. Other top players have joined the Guerreiras Project started by US ex-professional footballer Caitlin Fisher to use football to promote gender equality in Brazil where media stereotypes, lack of financial resources and other challenges have held back the sport. Things have changed very slowly since a ban on women’s football was lifted at the end of the military dictatorship in 1979.

Why does all this matter? Because the World Cup offers a chance to highlight not just the fight for equality in women’s football in Brazil but how the game can transform attitudes and life opportunities for girls and women who face deep discrimination and social exclusion. I’ve seen this for myself.

In the favela complex of Penha, a long way from the Football for Equality Plaza, the Favela St project recruits ex-drug traffickers as football coaches to help keep young people out of the drugs trade and create role models. When I visited Penha last year, its founder Philip Veldhuis told me: “The kids here have a choice: join the drug traffickers or play football with us.”

Some girls were initially shy to join the training sessions, he said, because they feared being ridiculed.

Favela St currently trains around 1,000 children and young people, including 80 girls.

A year later, I watched a team of teenage girls from Favela St celebrate their victory over girls’ teams from nine other countries, including England, in the girls’ tournament of the Street Child World Cup in Rio. Now they hope to become positive role models in one of Rio’s toughest communities, encouraging other girls to sign up to a programme that boosts confidence and self-esteem, empowering young people in poor areas where educational provision is scant, violence is rife, and teen motherhood is common.

These girls achieved success against very high odds, but they can’t overcome prejudice alone. “No one knows about us, or that we won the SCWC, or even that we played. People don’t pay attention to female football,” one of the players, Drykha, said last week. “If the boys’ team had won, they would have more prestige. The minister of sport would be applauding.

""More attention should be paid by Brazil’s leaders to help female football grow further, because there is so much talent here and so many [women] who could be playing for the country but aren’t given the opportunity.”

So, if you are going to Rio for the World Cup, why not head for the Football for Equality Plaza and find out why Brazil should change the game?",World Cup 2014: Why Brazil is no country for female football players,http://www.theguardian.com,[Jo Griffin],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401891911020/0bc0cbf3-e908-4d60-8fdf-0f32854edcfe-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=251942aabb575507f15f461605bb12c6,2014-06-05 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/she-said/2014/jun/05/world-cup-2014-why-brazil-is-no-country-for-female-football-players
1327,"Syke Farm Camping Ground, Buttermere

Syke Farm is tucked away in a quiet Lake District valley to the south-west of Keswick in the tiny hamlet of Buttermere. This is an unpretentious, no-frills campsite with an unapologetically back-to-basics approach. Facilities are fairly basic – there's no reception or shop, and the only source of provisions is the farmhouse in the village offering eggs and milk. The remote location and scant facilities almost makes it feel like you've stumbled upon a bygone era – but spend a few days relaxing in Buttermere, gazing into the bubbling beck and eating too many locally made ice-creams, and you'll begin to understand exactly why this campsite is so well-loved.

Fisherground campsite, Eskdale

The first thing that meets you on arrival is the pond, often full of children playing on tyre rafts – it makes a perfect focal point for kids to get to know each other. Nearby, a cool playground has everything adventurous young daredevils desire including zip wires, climbing frames and tyre-rope swings. And there's an added extra: the campsite sits along the route of the Ravenglass and Eskdale steam railway line – an excellent way to arrive if you're coming by public transport. Campfires are permitted, with bags of logs, kindling and firelighters sold on site.

Chapel House Farm, Stonethwaite

Chapel House Farm campsite may be a simple little place, but the view is astonishing, thanks to its position in a single open field in the beautiful valley of Borrowdale. Cars are banished to the car park, which seems completely fitting in such a pure, pristine location; lugging your kit a short distance to the camping area is a small price to pay for that special Lakeland serenity. Borrowdale is ringed by the high fells, but the wooded valley also offers miles of stress-free river and lake-side strolling, making this one of the most appealing locations in the Lake District.

If you're all ""laked-out"" and find yourself yearning for some good old dry land, then the lake-free Langdale valley is where you'll find it. Sitting serenely in the heart of the valley is Baysbrown Farm, which looks out over three generously sized camping fields. There are no designated pitches here; just rock up and find a suitable corner to call home. The site lies beneath the humbling rocks of Crinkle Crags, Bowfell and the Langdale Pikes, giving a sense of scale rarely found in the Lakes. Peering out from your tent each morning at the mist-shrouded peaks is worth the pitch fee alone.

Gillside Farm, Glenridding

One of the finest views in the Lake District can be enjoyed by standing in the shadow of Helvellyn and looking out across Ullswater's valley. Being able to relish such scenes from your tent just adds to the experience, making Gillside Farm a great place to pitch. Rabbits and sheep roam unfettered and unfazed on this working farm, so don't be surprised to be woken by the sound of sheep snacking on the tasty grass around your tent. Head to the farmhouse each morning to stock up on fresh milk and eggs, or visit the small hut down by the walking track for a hearty English breakfast. With its picturesque views and easy access to water and walking, Gillside Farm is low-key camping at its finest.

Piel Island campsite, Barrow-in-Furness

Piel Island camping, Cumbria

Accessible only via ferry (or a mile-and-a-half low-tide walk over the sands from Walney Island), Piel Island's 52 acres is home to one medieval castle, one pub, one brief terrace of Victorian houses, some grassland, a population of ""four, sometimes five"" and a beach. The view from the island stretches all the way from the Lake District hills across Morecambe Bay, and along the Fylde Coast to Blackpool Tower. While camping is allowed almost anywhere on the island, the ""official"" campsite is in a slight dip and is further protected by shrubs, which help divert the Atlantic winds. Walk back across to Walney Island during low tide to explore two nature reserves and the largest colony of lesser black-backed and herring gulls in Europe.

Great Langdale National Trust Campsite, Ambleside

Great Langdale Camping, Cumbria

Set in a wooded glen at the head of the Great Langdale valley lies this glorious campsite, surrounded by impressive peaks and slopes on all sides. It's a typical National Trust campsite: well-organised, efficiently run, and set in some of England's finest scenery. As you would expect, the walking from here is first-class, with many visitors here to conquer the Langdale Pikes, the triumvirate of peaks that dominate the skyline. For something a bit less challenging, grab a map from reception which outlines four easy walks around the valley. Or you could just walk to the pub – there are three within 10 minutes' walk from the site.

Eden Valley campsite

Eden Valley camping, Cumbria

The Eden Valley is Cumbria's forgotten secret. While the Lake District grabs all the attention, this glacial valley on the eastern side of the M6 slips quietly past the hordes of tourists. The campsite at Kirkoswald is home to just six simple pitches, two on a raised area and four down among the trees. Just up the road from the main site is a very private wild camping spot, which can be reserved by private arrangement. But it's the semi-secret walled garden that's the place to be as the sun settles. The lush sandstone of the farm buildings glows pink, and Eden Valley will seem like a secret you'll want to keep.

Thirlspot Farm, Thirlmere

Thirlspot Farm camping, Cumbria

Thirlspot Farm near Keswick feels like it might just be the perfect campsite. One reason for this is its location, surrounded by gorgeous English greenery and mighty mountains. Helvellyn, the third-highest peak in England, stands high and proud right behind the campsite and there are several different ways to its summit from the site, each challenging but manageable. Aside from its scenic credentials, Thirlspot also come up trumps in the ""proximity-to-pub"" stakes too, with one of the Lake District's finest traditional coaching inns, the King's Head (01768 772393), being directly next door. As we said, perfect.

Gill Head Farm campsite

Hidden in a quiet corner of the Lake District national park, Gill Head Farm offers space for tents and caravans, as well as B&B accommodation and six timber camping pods. The main camping meadow has spectacular views of Blencathra, a ridge of six separate fell tops stretching down the valley to Keswick. The owners have been thoughtful enough to arrange regular on-site activities, games, and bushcraft courses, as well as a log cabin (with TV lounge and undercover barbecue area) for communal get-togethers and wet-weather relaxation. But Ullswater is less than a 10-minute drive away, so you can head to the Lakes where a wealth of hiking, biking, ghyll scrambling and water-based activities await.

1329,"Now the UK is finally getting a decent bit of sunshine, we round-up our best articles on summer fun – from swimming spots and seaside stays to pub gardens and ice-cream parlours

Come on in, the water's warm – for once

The quickest way to take off the heat is to dive into a deliciously cool swimming pool. Sadly Britain's outdoor pools are struggling to survive but a few, among them Lymington Sea Water Baths, Shaolstone Seawater Pool in Brixham Devon and Bude Sea Pool in Cornwall, are holding their heads above water, the latter two kept alive thanks to passionate local swimmers. Read Jenny Landreth's piece about touring these three lovely pools in the south west.

If there is no outdoor pool near you, there may well be a safe stretch of open water. In his book Wild Swimming, Daniel Start takes dips in 300 rivers, lakes and waterfalls in Britain. We feature 10 of them in this piece, all places where you can just turn up and jump straight in. Or find a secluded beach with his guide to Britain's hidden beaches.

If you prefer the camaraderie of swimming in a group, then joining a club, or even a swimming holiday, could be the answer. Britain's last river swimming club can be found in rural Wiltshire: the Farleigh and District Swimming Club. Lisa Allardice joined them for a bracing swim in the river Frome. ""Wild"" swimming has become so popular that a growing number of us are booking swimming holidays abroad, from island hopping in Greece to swimming along the Croatian coast, we round up some of the best. And finally, if you love the idea but can't get near the water anytime soon, check out this video series about swims in Britain's rivers and lakes. You'll feel cooler just watching it.

Head to a pub garden or rooftop

Hartland Quay Hotel, near Bideford, Devon

We don't often get the chance to enjoy pub gardens without needing an umbrella or coat, so when the sun shines it's our duty to make the most of it. Zoe Williams reveals her favourite pub gardens around the UK for a cheeky lunchtime pint, while Robin Turner picks the top five in London, or if you have a head for heights, head up to one of the capital's rooftop bars.

Publican Charlie McVeigh, who grew up in north Devon, lists his favourite in the area, while Martin Wainwright tells us where to find a great pint in north Yorkshire. If you've got a proper thirst on you, Cumbria is the place to be. The best beer garden in the world, according to Kevin Rushby, is Langdale where a host of new microbreweries mean that the eight pubs dotted about this valley serve some of the finest beer in the country. Readers have also told us about some cracking Lake District pubs – read the best here.

Eat ice-cream

You don't have to go to Italy taste delicious handmade ice-cream. We've got some wonderful ice-cream parlours right here in the UK, from the famous Italian ones in Scotland and Wales to farm shops and even a canal-side cafe in London – read about these and other great places recommended by food writers, including Guardian critic Marina O'Loughlin. And if you do happen to be heading to Italy and want to avoid forking out nearly £60 for a round of ice-creams as one hapless tourist did earlier this year, then check out our guide to some of the best ice-cream parlours in Rome.

Book a seaside break

Sonia, the boat by the sea

If you were canny enough to look at the forecast and book a week off work during the current heatwave, you're in for a treat. No need to scour the web looking for a last-minute flight to warmer climes, just book into a seaside hotel on our own shores and enjoy cooling sea breezes and all of the above (pubs, ice cream, dips in the sea). Read our reviews of hotels and B&Bs in Fowey in Cornwall, Salcombe in Devon, Camber in Sussex, Whitby in Yorkshire, Oban in Scotland, or for something different, Carole Cadwalladr's review of a boat in a field by Cardigan Bay. Plus readers recommend their favourite coastal campsites.

If you're planning a day trip, our guide to some of the quietest beaches in the UK will help you steer clear of the sunseeking hordes. If you want more than just a beach we've also rounded up some of the loveliest spots along our coast, including fishing villages and towns with elegant Regency seafronts.

Have a watery adventure

Hand planing in Watergate Bay, Cornwall

You don't have to have hot weather to enjoy some of the watery activities offered by the UK's many adventure tour operators, but it helps. Make the most of the heatwave by canoeing down the river Bure in Norfolk, staying in riverside teepees en route, sea foraging by kayak in Pembrokeshire and exploring the west Highlands by kayak and on foot. Or if you're seeking new experiences, head to Cornwall to try out the latest surf craze: hand planing.",How to cool off in the UK this summer,http://www.theguardian.com,[Daniel Start],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/5/7/1367923325111/Wild-Swimming--010.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=025586251ad6bbafaf6c754f843853ef,2013-07-11 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jul/11/cool-off-uk-summer
1331,"In Venice, the jetset pay out for fancy restaurants and private launches but our tips mean you can enjoy the same views and (probably) more authentic food and drink for a fraction of the cost

Snack … all the time

If you're happy to swap a sit-down meal in a restaurant for a stand-up snack, you can save a fortune – as well as getting a chance to rub shoulders with the locals. A proper Italian breakfast is cheap and fast – coffee and a pastry knocked back standing at the counter of a pasticceria. Da Bonifacio (Castello 4237, Calle degli Albanesi) is moments away from the tourist heave of the San Marco ferry terminal, hidden down a crooked passage to the left of the Danieli Hotel. Order an espresso and a sweet, comforting tortino di riso, a pastry filled with rice pudding, fresh from the oven.

At lunchtime seek out one of the many bacari that pepper the city. These are small bars that serve ciccheti (tapas-like snacks for €1-€2). As well as being a fantastic way to fill up cheaply, they're usually full of locals: stylish, loud, downing prosecco and crostini topped with paper-thin prosciutto or creamed salt cod. You can find a bacaro on most corners, but we loved All'Arco on Calle Arco, which is full of old men and ladies with tiny dogs, and Alla Vedova on Ca D'Oro, where we tucked into delicious polpette (meatballs) and tiny glasses of vino bianco poured from a porcelain jug on the bar.

Join the traders

Venice's most important food market, the Mercato del Rialto, is at its most bustling early on Friday and Saturday, when locals and chefs are loading up with ingredients for the weekend. Wander among stalls piled with bundles of bright, shiny chillies, swordfish and glistening, inky-black squid. Shop for prosciutto, cheese, bread and fruit for a picnic or pop in to one of the traders' bars, such as Al Mercà, (213 San Polo, Fondamenta Riva Olio) for an 11am bruschetta and glass of prosecco. It's how the traders like to roll – when you're up at 4am, booze o'clock comes early.

Take the 'bus'

To appreciate the impossible dreamlike beauty of Venice, you have to get out on the water. Private water taxis cost over €100 but the more affordable vaporetti (waterbuses) can take you all over the lagoon. Line 2 travels the Grand Canal, making fewer stops than Line 1, so is usually less crowded; it then loops round to Giudecca, giving you a scenic tour for around €6. Even better value is buying a travel card (€25 for three days) which takes you on ferries to all of the islands.

Hit the beach

When you're stomping through Venice's hot streets all day, the desire to jump in to one of the canals can be overwhelming. Do not do this: the water is stagnant and filthy. Instead, take the vaporetto to the Lido then hire bikes at Lido On Bike (Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta, 21/B, from €5) and head down the island to Alberoni beach, the last one along. It's a nature reserve (warning: it also welcomes naturists), and is the wildest part of the lido with dunes, drift wood and plenty of sea birds. Trattoria al Ponte di Borgo, a rustic restaurant in Malamocco, a short walk or bike ride from Alberoni, is a good spot for an affordable meal.

Drink

Enjoying a a spritz in a Venice bar Photograph: Alamy

Dining out in Venice is expensive so it comes as a surprise to discover that drinking is incredibly cheap, which may explain why locals can often be spotted with a glass in hand from 10am. A glass of prosecco, which is a local speciality, or a spritz (a mix of prosecco and Aperol or Campari) cost us no more than €2.50 in any bar. Go north to Canareggio, a peaceful, local district, and do a mini bar-crawl along Fondamenta degli Ormesini stopping at highly-rated Caffe Dodo and Al Timon.

Escape the touristy centre

Your money goes much further if you can escape the centre and head into one of the city's residential neighbourhoods – which is fun to do without a map; more than any other city, there's a surprise on every corner in Venice.

Wander through the Rialto market, with the Grand Canal on your right, into Santa Croce, a vibrant quarter. Osteria La Zucca near Campo San Giacomo does tasty, affordable vegetarian food, and Alaska Gelateria (Calle Larga dei Bari) does a mean fig ice-cream. Next, go south into the Dorsoduro, where we stumbled on the Church of San Barnaba (which appears in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), where there was a lively flea market going on outside, and as an added bonus there was a lively flea market going on outside.

We also discovered Campo Santa Margherita, a bustling student square, with affordable places to eat and drink. We settled down with a platter of cured meat and glasses of prosecco in Osteria alla Bifora (Campo Santa Margherita 2930), a bar in a former butcher's shop.","Venice on a budget: how to eat, drink and travel cheaply",http://www.theguardian.com,[Becky Barnicoat],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/17/1382030719545/Vaparetto-waterbus-travel-008.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=677cc62dcaec4684d0c2163d0e4b8afe,2013-10-18 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/18/venice-on-a-budget-eat-drink-cheaply
1333,"In the first of a new series on holidaying in the Greek islands we look at the Sporades – including Skopelos, where Mamma Mia! was filmed – and Evia, the country’s second largest island, where the Greeks go on holiday

The Sporades, which stretch out into the Aegean off Greece's eastern coast, consist of 24 islands, but only four of these are permanently inhabited: Skiathos, Skopelos, Alonissos and Skyros.

Skiathos is the most-travelled of the islands thanks to its international airport, and its fame lies mainly in its sandy beaches. Away from the coast you can still find isolated hiking trails and the odd Byzantine monastery.

Skopelos is larger, but less visited than Skiathos. Its rugged scenery is perhaps more beautiful and certainly less developed. Its charms were celebrated in the film Mamma Mia!.

Much more rugged Alonissos lies in the middle of a marine park and is surrounded by a group on uninhabited satellite islands. Visitors have increased in the last decade or so, but it retains an exclusive air and some exceptional hiking routes.

Skyros is by far the least visited of the traditional Sporades, at least by non-Greeks (there is a domestic airport). Those prepared to find their way here, however, are amply rewarded by an atmosphere that blends traditional Greek village life with an increasingly trendy ""alternative"" vibe.

Although not strictly part of the Sporades, Evia also lies off Greece's eastern coast. The second largest island in Greece after Crete, and located conveniently close to Athens, it should be much better known (classicists might recognise it as Euboea). From its fertile north to the mountainous south it offers a wealth of travel opportunities.

All prices are for one week's accommodation for two in August, and include breakfast unless otherwise stated. Prices outside of this month can be considerably cheaper. You can usually expect to eat well for €15-20 per person. If eating places are cheaper/more expensive than this it is stated in the text.

Set on the small square of Steni (see below) this mountain taverna specialises in meat-based dishes, either from the oven or the grill. Mountain spring water emanates mysteriously from a tap in a nearby tree.

The road up the mountains to Steni from the east coast is spectacular, and do-able in a normal car even when not paved. The village itself is famed for its mountain air and spring water and is surrounded by hiking trails.

Pefki, northern Evia

Altamar Hotel, Evia

Where to stay: Altamar Hotel

Northern Evia is known for its fertility and this is certainly evident in the lushly green views afforded by this brand new hotel in Pefki. The minimalist design hides the fact that this is a friendly, family-run place. The surrounding countryside abounds in outdoor activities, including horse-riding, jeep trails and hiking.

Where to eat: Astron

Just outside the elegant port of Limni and 100 metres from the beach, this seafood based taverna has a great location. The Ioannou family were originally fishermen, and still bring in the catch and cook it fresh to order

• +30 22270 31487

Don't miss

Just to the south of Limni is the monastery of Ayiou Nikolaou Galataki, set on the wooded slopes of the mountains overlooking the mainland. The setting is superb, and the pretty white-washed complex is well worth the trip. If you are lucky, one of the few resident nuns will show you around.

Karystos, southern Evia



Where to stay: Aegea Hotel

Karystos is the main resort of southern Evia, and its neoclassical waterfront is mainly frequented by Greeks. The Aegea Hotel, just out of town, offers great views in a tranquil location. A swimming pool, and even some see-saws and swings, will keep the kids happy. Babis, the owner, knows the area well and can advise on lots of places to explore.

• +30 22240 27350, aegeahotel.com, €875, FF

Where to eat: Cavo D'Oro

There are plenty of tavernas on the waterfront at Karystos, but for a bit of authenticity you need to explore the alleyways behind. This establishment has been run by the same family since 1897. Forget menus and take a look at what's going on in the kitchen to spot what you want.

Southern Evia is all about the mountains, including the forbidding heights of Mount Ohi (1,399m), which has several hiking trails up it. An easier walk, but still hugely rewarding, takes you down the Dhimosari Gorge below the mountain. The route follows old, cobbled mule paths and passes watermills on the way. Start in the morning and you'll be enjoying a picnic on the beach by lunchtime.",Greek island holiday guide: the Sporades and Evia,http://www.theguardian.com,[Andrew Bostock],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/29/1398790408835/Agios-Ioannis-beach-on-th-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=09a9dae2e5b0bf3459b0ae3fab746813,2014-04-30 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/30/greek-island-holiday-guide-sporades-evia
1335,"Start planning your 2014 travels with the help of our top 40 destination round-up. Some are hosting major events, others are under-the-radar places only just starting to attract tourists, but all of them are inspiring or exciting right now

1. Cape Town, South Africa

Following in the footsteps of Helsinki and Seoul, Cape Town has been elected World Design Capital 2014, giving it the opportunity to showcase about 450 innovation projects. That it was selected more as a ""one to watch"" rather than a fully polished design leader makes it even more exciting to keep an eye on. To see a social/design experiment in action, go to Woodstock, a run-down suburb given a new lease of life through the Neighbourgoods Market), which sells artisan goods in a former biscuit factory: The Old Biscuit Mill. This is also home to Luke Dale-Roberts' restaurants the Test Kitchen and the Pot Luck Club & Gallery. The city has got what is being billed as the world's coolest cafe – Truth, drawing on a Victorian steam-punk theme,. For a township ""jazz safari"", or a tour specifically linked to World Design Capital 2014, see coffeebeansroutes.com.

Truth coffee shop, Cape Town.

2. Uzès, France



Our enduring love affair with France, and with Provence in particular, has been seized upon by Eurostar, which is extending the direct six-hour summer service from Ashford to Avignon by two weeks (28 June-13 September), with a view to a year-round service from 2015. One place sure to please Francophiles is Uzès, a short hop west of Avignon in rural Languedoc-Roussillon. The town has Renaissance architecture, mazy streets and nuns selling jam in Place aux Herbes. But a sure sign that Uzès is becoming a style outpost is the number of restored houses being run as maisons d'hôtes. L'Albiousse (from €155 a night) is a tasteful four-room luxury B&B in a 16th-century house off Place aux Herbes, owned by two former Paris restaurateurs. It is near the Musée du Bonbon, aka the Haribo Museum, as Uzès is the production site for Gummi Bears.

3. Austin, Texas, US



Hotel Saint Cecilia. Photograph: Cheri Lucas

Americans are well aware that this is Texas's coolest city, but a few happenings this year will help put Austin on the map for international travellers, too. British Airways now flies there non-stop from Heathrow five days a week; Terence Malick's as-yet-untitled new project features the city along with an epic cast (including Ryan Gosling and Natalie Portman); and hoteliers are cottoning on to its appeal: Austin-based healthy eating chain Whole Foods is planning its first health resort, and Mexico's hip Habita hotel group has its own impending opening. For now, the best places to stay are Hotel Saint Cecilia (doubles from $430, +1 512-852-2400) and Hotel San Jose, its cheaper sister across the street (rooms from $175, +1 512-852-2360).

4. Carmarthenshire, UK



The man himself would no doubt have approved. In the seaside town of Laugharne this year, the centenary of Dylan Thomas's birth, visitors who can prove it is their birthday can claim a free pint in Brown's Hotel, the very pub where Thomas liked to sit ""mouldering"" and giving his liver a punishing work-out (dylanthomasbirthdaywalk.co.uk). There will be festivals and events to mark the centenary all year, including a Dylan Thomas Poetry, Biography and Film Weekend in Laugharne, from 2-5 May, with poets including Simon Armitage and John Cooper Clarke performing in venues around town. (For a list of all centenary events see dylanthomas100.org). Brown's (browns-hotel.co.uk, doubles from £95) has been refurbished in a 1950s retro style that Thomas would probably find familiar, but it is now a boutique hotel, with iPod docks and lovely organic linens in its 14 rooms. And the Dylan Thomas boathouse has fabulous views of the Taf estuary and the Gower beyond.

5. Kolkata, India

Change is stirring in Kolkata. Travellers in 2014 will find the same Hooghly hubbub and ghosts-of-the-Raj atmosphere, but they'll also find a city on the move. There's a new airport terminal, a recently opened luxury mall and Kolkata's first skyscraper, The 42, a development just taller than Canary Wharf, has been dubbed the ""cloud-kisser of Chowringhee"" after the street it towers over. And Kolkata's metro system, India's first when it opened in 1984, is being expanded, eventually creating cross-town links for the first time. New hotel openings also sound a positive note. This month it's the legendary Great Eastern Hotel, opened in 1840 and hosting luminaries such as Mark Twain before falling into disrepair and eventually closing in 2005. In autumn, The Penthouse boutique hotel, from the Glenburn Tea Estate group, promises a dose of low-key chic.

6. São Tomé and Príncipe



Together the neighbouring islands of São Tomé and Príncipe form Africa's second-smallest nation. But it is shaping up to be one of its premier surf spots. With uncrowded waters surrounded by palm trees and white sands, Radiation Point (Praia de Algés) is often said to offer some of the best breaks on the continent and, in December, the International Surfing Association (ISA) gave the country its official seal of approval by inviting it to become its 78th member. Base yourself at Hotel Praia Inhame (chalets for two from $60), and you can also enjoy turtle watching, diving and fishing trips.

7. Alaçatı, Turkey



Outdoor dining in Alacati. Photograph: Alamy

Alaçatı, on the Cesme peninsula near Izmir on Turkey's Aegean coast, was for centuries a Greek settlement within the Ottoman empire. Ancient houses in the town were taken over by Turkish refugees in the 1920s, and city folk from Izmir would spend summers here. Then windsurfers discovered the near-perfect conditions in its bay and a hip Istanbul crowd fell for its cobbled streets and blue-shuttered stone houses. Over the past 10 years, boho-chic hotels, restaurants championing local produce and antiques shops have mushroomed. The latest opening is Alavya (doubles from £159 B&B with Exclusive Escapes): 25 bedrooms, two restaurants, a spa and a swimming pool set in a walled garden. Pale rooms are filled with contemporary Turkish art, and there's a private yacht for guests. There are also plenty of cheaper hotels such as the Tas (doubles from £80 B&B) or the Incirliev (rooms from £60 B&B). In the morning have coffee at Köse Kahve then browse Köse Dukkan for gifts and linens, and the art and antiques shops on Hacı Memis street, stopping for more coffee at Dutlu Kahve (Mulberry Cafe), then a country-style lunch at Asma Yapragi. By day the streets are a treasure trail of strange fruits and vegetables, at night they resemble a vast outdoor cafe or club. Fly to Izmir with easyJet (from April), Pegasus or Turkish Airlines. See explorealacati.com.

8. George Town, Malaysia



Once George Town was named a Unesco world heritage site in 2008, the capital of the Malaysian state of Penang began changing into one of south-east Asia's hottest destinations. Penangites are renovating everything from Chinese mansions to old factories, which means there's something for all budgets – delicious street food or fine dining; funky hostels or boutique hotels. The latest spot is the Three Sixty Degree Sky Bar. Follow drinks there with either a plate of spicy duck soup from one of the stalls on Kimberley Street or gourmet Penang Nyonya cuisine at Seven Terraces, the restaurant everyone wants to be seen at. In addition to the month-long George Town festival (1-31 August), this year the city will host the first south-east Asian edition of Tropfest (20-25 January, free), the world's biggest short film festival.

9. Alberta, Canada



The Glacier Skywalk. Photograph: Scott Rowed

Ontario has Toronto and Niagara; British Columbia has Vancouver and Whistler. Poor old Alberta comes third on UK visitors' lists, according to the Canadian Tourist Commission. But this may well change in 2014, with the opening of the Glacier Skywalk, pictured below, (from 17 May, £15 adults/£7 children) on the Icefields Parkway, between Banff and Jasper. The horseshoe-shaped, glass-floored walkway – similar to the Grand Canyon Skywalk – takes visitors 280m above the Sunwapta valley, over crashing waterfalls. The Glacier View Inn has a glacier package (from £84pp for double room and tour). World-class skiing is an hour or two's drive away: try Lake Louise, named Canada's best ski resort at the World Ski Awards. For city life try Calgary, which has gone from cowboy town to cosmopolitan cool.

10. Bordeaux, France



Like a classic wine, Bordeaux took a bit of time to come into its own. A renewal programme instigated by mayor Alain Juppé in the 1990s has transformed Bordeaux from a congested and claustrophobic place into a bright, modern city. Neo-classical facades have had a steam clean, sleek trams snake through the boulevards and the once-desolate riverfront has been redeveloped. The latest splash of colour comes in the form of a fleet of Philippe Starck-designed scooter-bikes, being tested for a cycle share scheme. Starck is also behind the new Mama Shelter, (doubles from €59) a budget hotel that opened in the former HQ of France's national gas company last October.

In the northern docklands, old warehouses are being recast. Les Tontons (from €10 for two courses) in the cavernous former dock offices serves up to 500 people a chic take on canteen-style food. Just over the Bacalan Bridge is Le Garage Modern, car repair shop by day and performance venue by night.

But everything leads back to wine. The CAPC Musée D'Art Contemporain de Bordeaux is in an old wine warehouse on the harbour, and just five minutes from Wine & Soul (23 rue du Couvent), a cosy cave-like wine bar.

11. Iran



Mosque in Imam Square, Esfahan, Iran. Photograph: Alamy

November's historic nuclear agreement means there hasn't been a better time for westerners to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution. Although the Foreign Office (FCO) still advises against all but essential travel (because the UK has no embassy there), other countries, including the US and Australia, deem most areas safe. The FCO does say groups are safer than independent visits, and the options are increasing. Wild Frontiers has three group trips to Iran (15 days from £2,705pp), and its website has a guide covering insurance, safety and dress codes.

In the first journey of its kind, the Danube Express train will travel across Iran for 15 days in October (from £8,695pp). Despite the high price, demand is such that new dates for 2015 have already been added. Iran's highlights include Persepolis, Esfahan, Tehran and Shiraz, the Zagros mountains and the Bavanat valley.

12. Belgium



The world's eyes will be on Belgium this year for the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war. The first soldier to be killed in the fighting died in Liège at dawn on 4 August 1914; the first and the last British soldiers to die were both killed in Mons, near the French border. Brussels is staging a major exhibition, 1914-18: It's our History!, which opens on 7 February at the city's Royal Army Museum. There are also scores of other commemorative events all over Flanders, the northern part of Belgium: see visitflanders.co.uk for details. Tour operators are running guided trips, too: such as Ramblers Worldwide, which has a Walking the Ypres Salient tour (from £999, including half-board accommodation and Eurostar travel, which includes the Tyne Cot cemetery, near Ypres.

13. Brazil

Be prepared for Brazil to take over your living room this year: images of Sugarloaf and Cristo will be everywhere in the build-up to the World Cup. But Brazil's real magic is in the jungles and beaches of its 8,000km coastline. Website Hidden Pousadas Brazil showcases small pousadas, ecolodges and hotels all over the country.

In the relatively unexplored north-eastern state of Alagoas, a succession of rustic-chic laid-back beach pousadas offer fabulous cuisine: try Pousada da Amendoeira (bungalows from £110) on Praia do Toque, or Pousada Casa Zulu (doubles from £46) in Icaraizinho de Amontada. Beaches aside, anyone heading to Manaus for England's opening match against Italy should make time to explore the world's greatest tropical rainforest: Pousada Uacari (three nights full-board from $550pp) is a floating lodge in the heart of the jungle.

14. Macedonia



Despite a history of winemaking that goes back to Roman times and romantic Mediterranean villages with Byzantine churches and terracotta roofs, Macedonia continues to be overlooked in favour of better-developed attractions in nearby Italy and Greece. But with the number of visitors steadily increasing year on year, it's only a matter of time before the obvious appeals of this small, picturesque nation begin to be recognised. Next year marks the completion of the Skopje 2014 project, a multimillion euro scheme to transform the capital city – including the building of new bridges and museums and replacing the facades of buildings in a neo-classical style. However, the real treat for visitors is spectacular Lake Ohrid, a vast lake by whose edge perches a town of the same name the perfect place for a dreamy, and affordable, escape (see ohrid.com.mk).

15. Paso Robles, California, US



The Artisan restaurant in Paso Robles

Napa and Sonoma wine-tasting rooms can get crammed with cheesy honeymooners but Paso Robles attracts an earthier oenophile – which isn't to say that the wine's not excellent. Dubbed ""the anti-Napa"", Paso is slowly transforming into one of America's foodiest little towns.

""You can feel the energy,"" says Steve Heimof of Wine Enthusiast Magazine, which recently named Paso Robles wine region of the year. ""Over the past two years these winemakers have been making crazy, wild blends of red. It would be hard to do that in Napa: it's so traditional there.""

Since 2000, the number of wineries has quadrupled to 200 (sample top zinfandels and red blends at Dusi Vineyard or Epoch Wines , and while it seems a new chef moves in from LA or San Francisco every few months, an ""old"" favourite restaurant (circa 2006) is Artisan, famous for decadent lamb-leg dip and Cuban sandwiches.

""It's been exploding – for good and ill,"" says Jon Bonné, wine editor for the San Francisco Chronicle. ""There's more tourist infrastructure – restaurants, small bakeries, places aimed at visitors who might not have appreciated Big Bubba's Bad to the Bone BBQ.""

16. Rabat, Morocco



Ask people to name a Moroccan city and most will say Marrakech or Fes, or even Casablanca. Poor Rabat – the country's capital – will probably be way down the list. Which is a shame, because it certainly has its draws, including a historic medina plenty of souks, and a French-colonial ""new town"", one of the most ambitious 20th-century urban projects in Africa. Many visitors say they find it less chaotic than Marrakech. Rabat was given Unesco world heritage status in 2012 and the city could be on the brink of experiencing the Ryanair effect, as new flights link it to Stansted from February. (See rabat-tourisme.org.)

17. Yunnan, China



The rice terraces of Yuanyang. Photograph: King Wu/Getty

With its dramatic scenery and cultural diversity, the far south-western province of Yunnan is rapidly becoming a favourite with domestic tourists yet remains relatively unknown to foreigners. It's not difficult to see the appeal: in contrast to so many other parts of China, the province has managed to stave off smog and factories, instead preserving a pristine countryside dotted with traditional villages and overlooked by the kind of majestic mountainous landscapes that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. The ancient town of Dali has become a magnet for the nation's bohemians. Other highlights include the rice terraces of Yuanyang: these centuries-old paddy fields are home to the Hani people, just one of over 50 recognised minority ethnic groups that call Yunnan home, and each with its own colourful and distinct customs, language and dress. Travel with Wendy Wu Tours, which offers a 17-day Yunnan Adventure from £2,690pp including flights, meals and accommodation.

18. Budapest, Hungary



Wes Anderson's latest flick, The Grand Budapest Hotel, was mostly filmed in Gorlitz, in eastern Germany. But its fantasy pastel hues and sepia-toned aesthetic do whet the appetite for a central Europe escapade. And Budapest is still the best-value European city for a mini break according to a recent report by the Post Office. Renaissance and art-nouveau architecture provides a romantic backdrop to an increasingly hip destination; the newly opened Baltazar Hotel, with rooms by cutting-edge designers, is just one example, while the eighth district – previously a no-go zone – continues to flourish, with galleries and laid-back cafes.

19. Rwanda



Lake Kivu, Rwanda

This April marks the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide (and an annual month of mourning). Few countries can have transformed so much in two decades. Today, under controversial president Paul Kagame, streets are spotless, people live in tin- or slate-roofed houses and 98% of the country has Wi-Fi access. But it's the country's natural wonders that are the big draw. The mountain gorillas made famous by Dian Fossey used to be the preserve of high-end travellers, but mid-range accommodation is starting to open in Virunga national park, and the development of the Congo Nile walking and mountain-biking trail – which takes in stunning Lake Kivu – will no doubt lure intrepid active travellers. With Nyungwe forest named a top trip by National Geographic, Rwanda's future as a nature destination is starting now. Book with Expert Africa.

20. Cuba



""Go now before it changes"" is the common refrain but Cuba is already changing. Legislation governing private enterprise is altering the visitor experience. Tourists have long been able to stay in a room in a private home – a casa particular – but now entire historic houses can be let. Suite Havana is a fantastic two-bedroom apartment with a roof terrace in Old Havana. Ydalgo's Penthouse, is a three-bedroom apartment owned by a designer, in the city's Vedado district – which also features chic Cafe Madrigal. Both accommodations are available through new operator Miraviva, from about $250 a night. Casa particulares are changing too: kitsch homestays being superseded by stylish homes, such as beautiful Finca Kenia in Trinidad – a great spot to enjoy this year's 500th anniversary celebrations. ""Now is a brilliant time to visit,"" says Charles Tyler of Miraviva. ""You have the trappings of communism, with no advertising, and no McDonalds, no Starbucks and so on, but a better standard accommodation, really good food and new experiences.""

21. Iceland



Iceland's mountains and lava field are making it popular with filmmakers. Photograph: Miles Wills/Getty

Iceland is gaining credibility as the ""Hollywood of the North"" after several blockbusters were shot there, including Oblivion, Prometheus and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Two of this year's anticipated hits were also shot amid the lava fields and glaciers: Interstellar, Christopher Nolan's sci-fi movie, and Darren Aronofsky's Noah. Tick off the locations on a road trip along the spectacular 832-mile ""route one"" ring-road (from £690pp with discover-the-world.co.uk). The first hotel in the new Stracta chain opens in May near Hella in south Iceland, with doubles from £86. Wow Air flies from Gatwick to Reykjavik from £138 return.

22. Abu Dhabi, UAE



An island off Abu Dhabi is the antithesis of the glitz around it. Sir Bani Yas was founded as a wildlife reserve in the 1970s and, following a conservation programme, is home to Arabian oryx, cheetahs and flamingoes. The Anantara group's accommodation is ""luxury"" but its two new hotels feel unflashy: the 30 villas of Al Yamm overlook the beach and the turtle nesting grounds; the 30 villas of Al Sahel are in the savannah grasslands, where gazelle and giraffes graze in front of your balcony. Trailfinders has a seven-night two-hotel break from £1,389pp.

23. Catskills, US



Phoenicia Diner, Phoenicia

These lush mountains 100 miles north-west of Manhattan have long been a refuge for city folk, with New Yorkers sailing here up the Hudson river since the early 19th century and, of course, Woodstock has long attracted hippies. In recent years, though, the Catskills' rustic barns and one-street towns have drawn a clutch of fashiony Brooklynites. Their top spot is the 300-person town of Phoenicia, where The Graham and Co hotel (doubles from $125, +1 845 688 7871) lives up to a hipster's country fantasy: guests are greeted with cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon at check in; rooms are furnished with machine-age metal fans, rough-hewn tables and potted succulents; and in the evenings everyone watches old movies sitting round a campfire. But New Yorkers would not venture here if the food wasn't decent. While it's all chocolate milkshakes and shrimp-and-grits at the Phoenicia Diner, a 1962-era haunt with a recent makeover, it's more New Yorky 10 minutes east at Peekamoose Restaurant in the town of Big Indian. Here, the menu includes clam-studded ramen and succulent beef short ribs supplied by local farms and cooked by Manhattan chef-owners Devin and Marybeth Mills. At Lucky Dog Organic Farm in Hamden, home-produced ingredients are made into lunches of meatloaf panini or cauliflower and cheddar soup, followed by ""killer chocolate"" ice-cream from Mama's Boy Coffee Shop

Some burn everything off by hiking the 5.6-mile Mount Tremper trail; others prefer browsing vintage dresses and vinyl at The Mystery Spot in Phoenicia. On the drive back to the city, you'll soon be able to stop at the Marina Abramovic Institute, where the revered performance artist is creating a cultural spa.

24. Blackwater estuary, Essex, UK



Island hopping in Essex? The idea may never have crossed your mind but there are great little spots out in the Blackwater estuary. Osea, the private island a few miles from Maldon where the rich and famous party, is hosting several special events this year: kids' camps, boutique festivals, pop-up restaurants. Although a restaurant for daytrippers has been rumoured, only overnight guests are currently allowed to cross Osea's exclusive causeway (cottages for two from £295 for two nights).

Less pricey and open to all is Mersea Island, famous for its seafood. Don't miss the delicious platters at The Company Shed . Leeward House, a B&B by the beach, has doubles from £70, or splash out – almost literally – on The Raft, a floating cabin sleeping four near Maldon from £195 a night.

25. Lagos, Nigeria



Kingdom brand by Caven + Etomi. Photograph: Picasa

Lagos is emerging as something of a creative hub. In fashion, the striking colours and bold fabrics used by labels such as Maki Oh (by Maki Osakwe) and Kingdom by Caven + Etomi, are helping bring global attention to the Nigerian fashion scene. The capital's art scene is opening up, too, with organisations such as Video Art Network Lagos curating film festivals and experimental media art events around the capital – though these are small-fry compared with the big-bucks Nollywood film industry. While it is predominantly visitors from other African countries who are drawn by Nollywood, the steady attention Nigerian films are getting in America and the UK means more international visitors will want to visit its heartland.

""Nollywood has become a worldwide phenomenon,"" says Lagos- based artist Emeka Ogboh. ""People are curious to see the space it depicts."" People are coming to feel the city's vibes and energy.""

26. Dyess, Arkansas, US



Arkansas isn't the type of place that figures too often on travel bucket lists. And Dyess, Arkansas (population 500) probably never has. But that is set to change this year with the opening of Johnny Cash's boyhood home as a museum (http://dyesscash.astate.edu). The single-storey wooden farmstead is being returned to its original state as part of a $10m tourist project designed to get the town back on its feet – echoing the fresh start Cash's parents got when they were given the farm in the 1930s as part of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal.

The house is the centrepiece of a restoration project that aims to tell the history of the purpose-built Depression-era town. It is scheduled to open on 26 April, and the hope is that some of the 600,000 people who visit Graceland, home of Cash's contemporary Elvis Presley, will drive a further 50 miles north from Memphis to the Man in Black's museum. Cash's surviving brother and sister have ensured that all the furnishings – upright piano, pot-bellied stove, Silvertone tabletop radio – are authentic and accurate.

27. Mongolia

Mongolia, land of windswept plains, nomadic herdsmen and abundant wildlife, used to be the preserve of explorers and intrepid backpackers. But an increase in visitor numbers, by 11% between 2009 and 2012, has prompted interest from tour operators. Overland specialist Dragoman has a new 21-day trip for 2014, with wild camping, hiking and horse-riding (from £1,102pp with a kitty of US$710, excluding flights), while Black Tomato has introduced a nomadic ski adventure ending with an ice festival on a frozen lake (from £4,285pp).

With the government pouring money into infrastructure – construction has started on a new airport near capital Ulan Bator – tourism is set to play an even greater role in the country's economy. That's not to say the place is about to get crowded - this is still one of the last untamed destinations in the world.

28. Yorkshire, UK



Hosting the Grand Départ of the 2014 Tour de France puts a place on the map but there's a lot more to Yorkshire than two days of carbon bikes and Lycra. In fact, the Tour route misses a lot of what's best in the region: the North York Moors, the North Sea coast, and the Wolds in East Yorkshire. Whitby has been an attraction since Victorian days: Lewis Carroll was a regular at what is now the La Rosa Hotel, but Scarborough and Filey further south are great, too. Even Bridlington, powered by resident David Hockney, is on the up, perhaps helped by the award-winning Wold Top Brewery.

Beer is excellent throughout Yorkshire and there's a new brewery, Stod Fold, in Halifax, to add to an impressive list. Good food is found in simple cafes: the Little Organic Bakery on Wellington Road in Bridlington is a new gem; and for great fish and chips, try the Harbour View Cafe on Scarborough's West Pier. There are Michelin stars, too – more than in any other county. One newcomer, The Star in the City in York, is run by Andrew Pern, who built The Star at Harome into a top restaurant with rooms. With Hull set to be City of Culture 2017, Leeds' modern events arena, and Sheffield boasting more artists than London, Yorkshire is definitely buzzing.

29. La Maremma, Italy



La Maremma. Photograph: Alamy

La Maremma was Tuscany's final frontier, a quiet area of rugged protected coastline from Capalbio up to Cecina. Over the past few years, though, the cognescenti have been taking notice, and while it is still no Forte dei Marmi (Tuscany's most fashionable resort), there have been some illustrious openings: Alain Ducasse's L'Andana hotel in Castiglione della Pescaia (from €300), Leonardo Ferragamo's marina in Puntone, and Renzo Piano's £6.7m winery at the Rocca di Frassinello vineyard.

But the super-rich don't have it all to themselves. New to boutique accommodation website i-escape this year is Locanda Rossa (doubles from €120 B&B) in Capalbi, close to the beach at Chiarone. It has 13 rooms, four apartments sleeping six, a restaurant and a pool.

30. Panama City



When hipster hotel chain Ace started looking for its first forays outside the US, it picked London first, then Panama City. Central America wasn't an obvious second move, but those who have spent time in the city's Casco Viejo neighbourhood can see the appeal. Sometimes compared to the French Quarter of New Orleans, the area mixes faded glory (dilapidated townhouses and 17th-century city walls) with newfound style (boutiques, cafes and fancy ice-cream parlours such as Granclément on Central Avenue.

The Ace project – a collaboration with Commune Design of Los Angeles and local property developer Conservatorio – has just opened as the American Trade Hotel (doubles from $259 +tax). At the other end of the scale, hostel Luna's Castle (dorm beds from £8 a night) is a down-to-earth party favourite.

31. Gdansk, Poland

In 1980, Lech Wałesa started a strike in a Gdansk shipyard that was the beginning of the end of the Soviet bloc. In summer 2014, the European Solidarity Centre – a museum, library and research centre – is set to open on the same spot, as a celebration of freedom and democracy. And that's not the only reason to come to this Baltic seaport. Gdansk has plenty to offer as a city-break destination, without feeling as touristy as Krakow. There's also far more to the local food scene than potato- and cabbage-stuffed pierogi; try the seafood at Bulaj in the nearby seaside resort of Sopot, or modern Polish recipes at Brovarnia , a buzzing waterside microbrewery and restaurant in the city.

32. Glasgow, UK



If your image of Glasgow is all rusting shipyards and deep-fried confectionery, 2014 would be a good time to rediscover Scotland's largest city as it welcomes the world during perhaps the biggest year in its history. That Glasgow is a fast-growing city-break destination is impressive: it did not even have a tourist office until the 1980s. In 1990, European City of Culture status kickstarted the regeneration. In 1999, the UK City of Architecture and Design award had a similar effect. Glasgow is indeed a city transformed.

In Finnieston, in between the centre and the West End, Zaha Hadid's Riverside Museum, named European Museum of the Year 2013, was joined last September by the sleek SSE Hydro concert and sports venue. The Hydro will be one of the stars of this summer's 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The cultural scene will be further boosted by Homecoming Scotland 2014, with dozens of cultural, historic and gastronomic events. Then there are the MTV Music Awards, being held in this Unesco City of Music for the first time, partly in recognition of the successful recent staging of a trio of Mobo Awards.

33. Tasmania, Australia

With one of the world's finest state capitals, some great beaches and a hinterland made for adventure and exploration, Tasmania already has a lot going for it but 2014 promises to be especially good. There's stylish new accommodation such as the ""boutique budget"" Alabama Hotel (doubles from £44) in a rejuvenated 1830s building in Hobart, or the full wilderness experience at New South West Wilderness Camp, which has just opened four huts in the South West national park, a largely untouched mountain region. The outdoors does come first in Tasmania – remember the successful campaign to protect the Franklin River? – but it is swiftly followed by food. On Bruny Island, captain Rob Pennicott does a great day trip where you collect seafood and then cook it on board (pennicottjourneys.com.au, day trips £370pp). Garagistes is arguably Hobart's top restaurant of the moment, but there are a few snapping at its heels: Lebrina, also in Hobart, and Stillwater in Launceston are fine places. And for an informal cafe atmosphere Hobartians head to Smolt in the Salamanca market area.

34. Somerset, UK



Somerset is no longer a West Country backwater. First came the celebrities. Then independent shops, restaurants and elegant places to stay such as At The Chapel helped put pretty-but-otherwise-unremarkable spots such as Bruton on the map. Now, the whole world looks set to take notice of this tiny village, as global art powerhouse Hauser & Wirth sets up shop on nearby Durslade Farm. The project is driven by visionaries Iwan and Manuela Wirth, who live nearby, and will include contemporary art spaces, a guesthouse and gardens by Piet Oudolf. Across the county in Bath, the Gainsborough (doubles from £289) is the first hotel to tap the town's thermal waters (the famous Bath Spa does not have accommodation). It will open this spring with 99 rooms and an enormous spa/bathing area inside a listed Georgian building.

35. Taiwan

Ever tried gua bao, the Taiwanese dish of pork belly in a steamed bun? A Taiwanese street food purveyor called Bao, based in London's Hackney, is on a mission to bring it to the British masses and has had an exceptional first year, winning accolades from Young British Foodies and the British Street Food Awards (people's choice award). Now the team behind it are hoping to inspire people to travel to Taiwan by launching a food tour, via Opentrips (opentrips.co.uk, five nights from 14 March, £645pp excluding flights). Founder Erchen Chang says her top tip is to visit the city of Tainan in southern Taiwan: ""It's the true capital of street food – and definitely not made for tourists.""

From oyster omelettes in Taipei's night markets to tea in a Maokong plantation, Taiwan is a fascinating place to eat and drink your way around. For year-round food tours, see taiwanfoodadventure.com, or learn to make the dishes yourself with a cookery lesson at Jodie's Kitchen.

36. Bangladesh



""Visit before the tourists come"": it's telling that the Bangladesh tourist board's slogan, introduced in 2006, still applies. While Burma and India, which it borders, are high on many travel wishlists, Bangladesh remains largely overlooked, despite having assets that include the world's longest beach (Cox's Bazar's 77 miles of sand, pictured) and the tiger's share of the world's largest mangrove forest (the Sundarbans, home to Bengal tigers). Travelling here isn't necessarily easy (and protests ahead of January elections mean visitors should check before booking), but they will be warmly welcomed. British-Bangladeshi Yasmin Choudhury has started Lovedesh.com, a website that focuses on the positives of otherwise stigmatised ""third world"" destinations, and to ensure her parents' homeland is not written off as a pitiful place, known only for floods. The website has a travel element and she will lead its first trip to Bangladesh at Easter (10 nights from £1,400, excluding flights), utilising her local contacts to showcase the country's little-known highlights, including boat trips through rural Sylhet and plenty of wood-fired curries. Exodus has also just launched a 15-day tour (from £2,099, including flights).

37. Moscow, Russia



Jeff Koons' Caterpillar Chains at The Garage, Moscow

It's hard to ignore the furore around Russia at the moment. But although the recent releases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Pussy Riot may have been more government charm offensive than genuine democratic change (homosexuality is not illegal, as is commonly reported, though anti-gay hostility does exist), some areas, such as Moscow, are more forward-thinking. The capital is buzzing with a post-bling nightlife and a contemporary arts scene, and there is at least talk of change in the air, much of it about Dasha Zhukova's Garage cultural centre. A new home for this ambitious project by the socialite, art collector and girlfriend of Roman Abramovich is still under construction in Gorky Park, on the site of a ruined Soviet-era restaurant, but there are already plans to stage fairs and shows that will attract both artists and visitors from around the world.

Interested Brits should be aware that Moscow is not your typical budget airline city break: it's a four-hour flight, and you need to brave the Kafkaesque business of applying for a Russian visa. But easyJet's new routes to Moscow from Manchester and Gatwick, and Ryanair's Dublin-Moscow route, which will launch this spring (with flights from the UK sure to follow if it's successful), mean the travelling classes will be arriving soon.

38. Folkestone, UK



Beyond the town's shabby (but improving) seafront, a grassroots arts scene has bubbled into a fully-fledged movement. Buoyed by the renaissance of nearby Hastings and Margate, the work of its artisans is now celebrated in the Folkestone Triennial. The event, curated by Lewis Biggs, formerly of Tate Liverpool, returns for a third time from 30 August-2 November. Works will be shown in public spaces such as the Creative Quarter, a colourful area of shops, studios and cafes, and a picturesque symbol of the town's changing mood.

39. Canberra, Australia



National Museum of Australia

The joke is that you ""See Yourself in Canberra"", as the tourist board puts it, because there's not much else to see in the Australian capital. And while it will never be a creative rival to Sydney or Melbourne, a commitment to art and architecture is adding cultural depth to the diminutive city (population 358,000). The new Hotel Hotel (doubles from £167) is not just a 90-room place to stay. It aims to promote local artisans by showcasing their work in the form of locally made or found furniture, artwork inspired by the bush or soft furnishings reflecting aboriginal patterns, and is part of a striking new complex that includes an open-air cinema, a bike shop and an art gallery. Meanwhile the geometric new cafe extension to the National Museum of Australia is an example of a burgeoning design scene.

40. Umeå, Sweden



As enthusiasm for all things Scandi continues, lesser-known corners are muscling in. The small town of Umeå in northern Sweden is on the periphery of Europe culturally as well as geographically, so its status this year as a European Capital of Culture is perhaps surprising, especially given that one of its attractions is the weird Umedalen sculpture park, with Gormleys and Kapoors in the grounds of a former mental asylum. It also has two Eurovision-themed clubs and is about to get a snazzy new cultural centre. Renovation of the historic Stora hotel in the centre will be completed by March.",Holiday hotspots: where to go in 2014,http://www.theguardian.com,[Guardian Writers],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/3/1388755051169/A-rickshaw-on-a-beach-in--006.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=0f4dea3fafd2dd7c8d1da13dacd09732,2014-01-03 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jan/03/holiday-hotspots-where-to-go-in-2014
1337,"Far from the gaudy clamour of South Beach and the pastel-hued elegance of the art deco district, Little Havana is home to Miami's thriving Latino community. Cubans began migrating to Florida in the 1950s but their numbers swelled after Castro came to power in 1959, and in the 1960s the area was named Little Havana. Miami now has a majority Latino community, with Spanish the predominant language in some parts of the city. Today, the stretch along SW 8th Street, or Calle Ocho, attracts tourists, but to savour this rich and vibrant part of the city, it's better to slow your pace, stick around a while, and watch the neighbourhood unfold.

1. There are few sweeter places to begin your day in Miami than Versailles Cuban Bakery (3501 SW 8th), which serves up hearty scrambled eggs and croquettes (as well as more Americanised pancake stacks with syrup). The real action happens around La Ventanita: the little takeaway window and bakery shop. Here, regulars linger around the counter enjoying café cubano and cortadito con leche evaporada (espresso served with condensed milk), morning empanadas, guava pastries and sugar cane juice with a little lime. If your Spanish is up to scratch, you'll be able to eavesdrop on first-generation exiles' fiery discussions of Cuban politics, local goings-on and the contents of the latest edition of the official Cuban Communist Party newspaper, Granma. It's a bit of a hike from the heart of the district, but worth it.

2. The Cuban Quarter begins in earnest a few blocks east, on Calle Ocho between 17th and 13th, with huge brightly painted roosters, a smattering of art galleries and the Walk of Fame, honouring famous Cubans such as Celia Cruz and Gloria Estefan. The surrounding area features murals, monuments and a statue of the Madonna (said to be illuminated by a shaft of holy light each afternoon), many of which stand around the Cuban Memorial Plaza – a short stroll from the main drag, and a focal point for this community in exile. You'll find an eternal torch dedicated to those killed in the Bay of Pigs invasion, and the Plaza de la Cubanidad, which commemorates those who drowned fleeing Cuba in 1994 aboard the 13 de Marzo tugboat. There is also a magnificent ceiba tree on Memorial Boulevard, at the roots of which are offerings left by followers of the Afro-Cuban religion Santería, for whom the ceiba is sacred.

3. There are now organised tours of the quarter's famous culinary highlights, from fruit stalls to ice-cream vendors, but it's wise to determine the mom-and-pop restaurants from the tourist spots. A decent choice is El Pub, at no 1548. It is an unassuming diner from the street, though inside it's welcoming, pleasingly old-fashioned, and with excellent bacalao (codfish), Cuban chorizo hamburger, chilindrón de cordero (lamb stew) and plantain chips. Sit at the counter to shoot the breeze with the locals, or nab one of the booths if you prefer a view of the restaurant, with its lazy ceiling fans and glass cabinets stacked with sandwiches.

4. After lunch, you can while away a contented hour watching the domino games at Máximo Gómez park. Here, older men and women sit neatly dressed, pressed and perfumed in the shade, playing ferociously competitive rounds of dominos. Chat to one of your fellow spectators (many of whom are eager to tell you just how, exactly, they ended up in Florida), or simply sit and listen to the rattle and shout of their play.

5. There are plenty of cigar shops along Calle Ocho but chief among them is the one at no 1528: Cuba Tobacco Cigar Company, its reputation well-set by five generations of the Bello Family; Don Pedro Bello may well be sitting in the doorway when you visit, smoking a cigar, of course, like a laid-back, leathery-skinned advertisement.

Azucar Ice Cream Company

6. Take a cooling pitstop at the Azucar Ice Cream Company at no 1503 (and if you do, try the mantecado, a Cuban favourite of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon). If you're still hungry, Los Pinarenos Fruteria at 1334 (famed for its healthy and not-so-healthy delicacies), you'll be ready for dinner at El Cristo. This local favourite, at no 1543, specialises in seafood, serving mixed platters and deep-fried snapper. Sit outside if you want to take in Calle Ocho at night.

7. Music is everywhere in Little Havana: spilling out of car windows and cafe radios; a mingling of son cubano, salsa, merengue and more. Lily's Records, at no 1419, offers the best in Latin music and has passionate, knowledgeable staff.

8. It would be foolish to leave this part of town without taking in a live show (and perhaps a little dancing). While plenty of venues have live bands, the last Friday of the month is Viernes Culturales or Cultural Friday, an open-air festival of art, food and live music. You'll find the hub of events at no 1637.

9. Local's tip:

""Visit the studio of one of the most celebrated Cuban artists in the world: the Agustín Gaínza arts gallery (agustingainza.com) is at 1652 SW 8th Street. Agustín is always at his studio and you get a chance to look around, chat to him and even see him in action painting.""

10. Where to stay

Apart from the sketchy-looking run of love motels with their hourly rates and heart-shaped Jacuzzis, Calle Ocho is still a little skimpy on places to stay. Your best bet at the moment is Airbnb; among its Little Havana properties is a brightly coloured house sleeping six (pictured above), from £61 a night, just a block away from the action. Inside it's clean and bright; outside, it has a hammock and garden. For something more salubrious, the Viceroy, doubles from $285) is a short bus ride away at the other end of 8th Street.

1339,"When the cyclists taking part in the Tour de France squeeze into their aerodynamic jerseys to take on the hills and dales of Yorkshire next month, one thought should make them face the upcoming challenge with sunny sangfroid: boy, are they going to eat well. Yorkshire is proud of the fact that it has more Michelin stars than anywhere in the UK outside of London. But while the cooking may be stellar, it's not all chi-chi attitude and snooty sommeliers; the finest food frequently comes in casual clothing. There's a take-us-as-you-find-us insouciance about even the most celebrated restaurants, and they're all the better for it.

The region does have a head start: the native produce is glorious. Seafood from the coast around Grimsby is justifiably famous: perky and fresh, lusciously smoked from Long Riston's Staal Smokehouse, or – my weakness – crisply battered as fish and chips from pilgrimage-worthy Mother Hubbards in Scarborough or Quayside in Whitby.

Somewhat surprisingly, there's a thriving charcuterie scene, too; Three Little Pigs in Beverley with Yorkshire salami, as ripe and pungent as anything from Italy; the scented, air-dried coppa and lomo at Leeds' excellent gastropub The Reliance; or Yorkshire Chorizo's top-notch products. Plus, of course, it has the Rhubarb Triangle – nine square miles between Wakefield, Morley and Rothwell famous for producing the fruit – which, for some reason, always makes me chortle.

The county is a place of striking contrasts. In elegant Harrogate, where the Tour de France's first stage ends, it doesn't stretch the imagination to imagine Jane Austen heroines wafting around to take the waters. At Salts Mill, a former industrial behemoth at Saltaire, you can stand in close proximity to David Hockney artworks, with none of the queues or attitude you may find in a major city. But within a few miles, my husband and I are peering across dark, intimidating expanses of empty moorland to try to find a pub in the middle of nowhere. Our orienteering is rewarded not by butch cuts of meat, but delicate vegetable dishes, scattered with vivid edible flowers; see – there's that contrast again.

Of course, over a few days, I can only provide a snapshot: there's a lot of Yorkshire and a helluva lot of fine places to eat. My apologies to Doncaster and Rotherham and Halifax. This visit doesn't allow for a wallow in Bradford's legendary curries (I don't even make it to ""the world's largest curry house"" in Cleckheaton). And I'm still a stranger to the Rhubarb Triangle. But we get more than a taste of the riches on offer. And what a taste it is, rich, unhurried, creative and warm – just like ""God's Own Country"" itself. With all this incredible food, I feel as though we should be romping on the Moors to work off some of the calories – driving around them feels like taking part in an even more indulgent version of Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan's The Trip. But seriously, what a trip it is.

North York Moors and around

The North York Moors, untamed and often isolated, all dramatic scenery: swooping banks of ancient woodland and eerie expanses of heather-speckled moors giving way to intriguing glimpses of stately homes. The honey-stoned villages here cradle some real culinary treasures, too.

The Star Inn at tiny Harome is far more than just a good-value local hero. Andrew Pern's cooking is an exhilarating combination of earthiness and terroir done with flair. So, cottage pie is made with roe deer, all depth and savour, and served in a tiny individual cast-iron dish with blackened carrots and the fragrance of bergamot. In the beamed rooms hang pewter mugs and shelves laden with family photographs so it feels blissfully relaxed; you could just have a sarnie and pint in the bar. We do a lot more than this.

We stay at the Pheasant Hotel (doubles £155 B&B), virtually next door and owned by Pern's ex-wife Jacquie. It is a bolthole of country chic, witty chintzes and comforting tweed. The restaurant here, too, is a bit of a star: young chef Peter Neville creates dishes whose prettiness of presentation belies their substance; white crabmeat with lemon sabayon; braised pigs' cheeks and squid with Alsace bacon and smoked butter mash. It would be easy to imagine a greedy weekend without leaving the village. But then we would have missed out on Malton, an increasingly foodie market town with its annual festival, specialist butchers and bakers, and monthly market: stalls selling game, rare-breed piglets, even local wine from Ryedale Vineyards. Not forgetting, um, Selina Scott's goatwool sock shop. There's even a vegan microbrewery and taproom, the excellent Brass Castle, whose range of local brews is dizzying. I like The New Malton, a handsome, flagstoned ""dining pub"" where pretentions are few, local beers flow freely and the food is good, from the posh – sea trout with crab butter – to the wonderfully plebeian – a damn fine ham, free-range eggs and homemade chips. Open fires, too. Lovely.

The big cities

Poor old Hull gets a bad rep, but it has a real sense of renewed energy and optimism: to do, perhaps, with it being declared UK City of Culture 2017. And yes, that energy is affecting the food scene. I've never seen so many new coffee shops, especially around the cool Newland Avenue area. It's here we also find the second branch of a newish company that has taken the city by storm. The Hull Pie2 purveys dangerously delicious pastry-wrapped items … barbecue pulled pork, maybe, or Moroccan-spiced vegetables and falafel. I Instagram its pneumatic sausage rolls and get a chorus of small moans in reply. We also acquire fine specimens from candy-coloured Fudge, a popular deli and restaurant along the road, at Princes Avenue. It seems Hull loves a good sausage roll as much as I do.

Down at the marina, the far more upmarket 1884 Dock Street Kitchen is a sprawling swankpot in a converted shipping office. Elton John may be warbling away on the sound system but the ingredients are top-notch – a heady, rich macaroni cheese, turned into purest luxury by the addition of loads of fresh truffle; dry-aged beef comes from Thirsk and fallow deer from Rievaulx Abbey. And it would be hard to find a better bargain in the city.

In York, I do like the recently landed outpost of the Harome original, The Star Inn The City (seebelow), a clever marriage of ancient building and modern architecture that almost juts over the river Ouse. Its terrace on a sunny day is a great spot for exploring the modern-British menu, the likes of Two Chefs ale-braised ox cheeks. Ah yes, ale … the city's thriving craft beer scene allows for a most superior pub crawl. Don't miss brilliantly bonkers Trembling Madness on Stonegate.

In the York suburb of Sutton-on-the-Forest is one of the oddest restaurants I've been to in a while. The Park sits in the grounds of a Georgian stately home, in what's little more than a zhuzhed-up garden shed, an extension of the mansion's tearooms. Chef Adam Jackson is bravely doing hours-long, tasting-only menus in this tiny gaff – 12 seats only – where I need my iPhone's torch function to locate the outdoor loos. Worth it, though (seebelow).

Yorkshire's love of old-school Italian restaurants reaches its apotheosis in Leeds at 40-year-old Bibis, a hectically over-the-top celebration of being ""Italianissimo"". This is where the city comes to dress up and party over cocktails and old favourites – steak pizzaiola, tiramisu – in an atmosphere that feels like something created by a drunken Cecil B DeMille. But it's not all glorious camp and carbonara, the new-wave is being spearheaded by the likes of Zucco on Meanwood Road, with its bentwood chairs and small Italian sharing plates. And the buzzy Friends of Ham with its, well, ham.

Street food is making waves too: there's a thriving hub in the unlikely environs of The Trinity shopping centre; everything from gourmet hotdogs and grilled cheese to northern China's favourite street food, the lacy, crêpe-like fried dough jian bing stuffed with egg and topped with fragrant herbs. And while almost inhaling a smoky, squidgy burger from Patty Smith's at the Belgrave Music Hall, I resolve to come back to this pleasingly ramshackle former assembly hall for its riotous monthly Street Feast, held on the second Saturday of every month.

Beverley, Ilkley and Harrogate

I love that even the most brooding and lowering Yorkshire scenery can suddenly open onto a cosy market town, with ancient squares and hunkering buildings. Beverley, in the east of the county, smells of woodsmoke and clean air and is every bit as pretty as the Cotswolds. At every corner there's a deli groaning with local produce, or a quirky little bistro.

We head to The Shed for potent cocktails, and – no relation – The Bread Shed, from where aptly named Liz Parkin tweets her bread specials, baked daily: cheese and chilli, maybe, or spelt-and-raisin bread; sticky Chelsea buns and freshly baked teacakes? Yes please.

A few miles away, in South Dalton, is The Pipe and Glass; to get there we drive in the dark through misty, werewolf-friendly lanes, squinting through the gloom. We find this Michelin-starred pub on the site of the original gatehouse to Dalton Park. Sure, you can have bangers and mash and fish pie, but we're here for painterly dishes such as white crabmeat on a seasalt crisp with an arrangement of herbs and edible flowers atop that's almost Mugaritz-like in its beauty.

In Harrogate, I am blown away by Van Zeller (seebelow). Our meal here comes after rather a lot of the old fayn daynin', and it's fair to say the teensiest bit of jadedness has kicked in. But Tom Van Zeller's dishes are so utterly beautiful it's like we've been given a shot of culinary oxygen. Even unlikely combinations work; flavours are immaculately judged but I think Tom simply has the magic touch. His cooking even manages to convert me to the joys of vegetables in puddings, with an iced parfait of parsnip sparked with lime foam on a rubble of almost toffee-d baked white chocolate. I am utterly bemused that food of this quality, some of the best I've eaten in recent years, isn't dripping with Michelin stars.

Ilkley, in the west, offers the languid pleasures of The Box Tree. From a kitchen also responsible for unleashing Marco Pierre White on to an unsuspecting world, chef Simon Gueller produces dishes every bit as haute bourgeois and expensive as the splendidly upholstered surroundings. Yes, there are galantines and veloutés and daubes – oh, the comfort. But everything is done with the lightest touch: crispy hen's egg with smoked haddock and mustard; the finest, flakiest onion bread. The mash that comes with a ripe, rolled shoulder of lamb is incomparable, thick with good butter. Andrew, the urbane maître d', plunges some intense raspberry purée into my cloud-light soufflé, which makes it look as though it's grinning. We certainly are.

We keep the buzz of an excellent lunch going by staggering across the road to The Flying Duck, the town's oldest pub and home to the Wharfedale Brewery. Checking the (low) prices for its excellent Blonde, Best and Black signature beers, we think they must be a joke. But they aren't – we're in Yorkshire.

Posh nosh for less dosh: Five of Yorkshire's top restaurants

With its tartan tweed, squashy sofas and walls lined with menus from the world's great restaurants, this posh pub (pictured above) on a country road is as comforting as sinking into a rum-laced hot chocolate. In the eight years that James and Kate Mackenzie have run it, they've transformed it from an unloved boozer into a Michelin-starred must-do.

• Mains from £8.95

People travel from across the country to this 14th-century thatched building for chef Andrew Pern's skilful cooking – he's able to add lightness and delicacy to a meat-fest of dishes: Ryedale lamb – rack, rump, choux farci, haggis, tongue, cheek and brain.

There's warmth and humour, too. Home-made bread (oh my, the black-pudding loaf) is served in a flat cap, and restaurant manager Stelian Cristea is a charmer of the old school.

• Three-courses for £25, Mon-Sat

This restaurant is an extension of the tearooms in the grounds of Sutton Park, a stately home owned by Samantha Cameron's father. The chef (from the nearby Michelin-starred Black Swan) clashes traditional and modernist techniques to deliver dishes that are as beautiful to look at as they are to eat. A pearly scallop on a pool of creamily fragrant celery purée, with shards of apple and actual apple blossom, is a highlight.

• Eight courses for £48

In Harrogate's chic and arty, largely 19th-century Montepellier Quarter, local boy Tom Van Zeller is creating inventive dishes such as raw scallops with turnip ice-cream, curry oil and pomegranate. Where else can you find a tasting menu, each course a mini thrill, each mouthful eliciting gasps, that comes in at £35 a head?

• Tasting menu for £35

This restaurant (pictured below) may look a little like a 90s nightclub but there's real ability in the kitchen. Presentation is elegant – slender wild asparagus draped languorously over John Dory. And the prices are amazing.

• Three courses for £16 (at lunchtime)

1341,"On a rest and relaxation weekend in the Cairngorms, discover your inner Tom and Barbara with ukelele, baking and yoga classes – and plenty of laughs and good food, too

Our ukulele instructor exhorts us to let go of our inhibitions, and launches into song. ""That's it G,C,G,D, … G,C,G,D ...'In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight …'""

While the group strums along, delighting in the collective endeavour, I find myself thinking of the Clash, and wondering if I could get away with grabbing my uke by the neck and smashing it down in the middle of the circle of joy.

I'm in a Georgian country house by an ancient Caledonian forest in the Cairngorms, drinking mulled wine and strumming the small instrument favoured by George Formby in an attempt to rediscover the ""good life"". While Tom and Barbara may have nailed it by growing their own veg and winding up Margot and Jerry, Polly and Ross Cameron at the Dell of Abernethy near Aviemore are hoping that their beautiful setting and a range of hearty activities – including seasonal yoga, bread-making and, yes, ukulele sessions – will be just as effective.

Aviemore is the gateway to the Cairngorms and is the region's snow sports base, but the ancient forests, rivers and lochs provide enough incentive to visit year-round. The Camerons, who run a holiday home business in the area, think so – which is why they decided to host four weekends a year, each designed to harness the talents of local residents and share the seasonal delights of the area. A weekend package includes all classes, food and copious amounts to drink, but non-participating partners can come along for a reduced fee, and locals, or those passing through, can sign up for individual classes.

Things starts well, with whisky in the lurid lounge car of the Scotrail Caledonian sleeper from London to the Highlands. When I wake up, grey concrete and sprawling suburbs have been replaced by snow-capped mountains and dawn-illuminated clouds. If there is a better way to start a holiday, I've yet to find it.

Bleary-eyed but happy, I'm met at Aviemore by Ross, who apologises immediately. ""Sorry, I was meant to pick you up in a Morris Minor – a bit more Barbara and Tom – but it wouldn't start, so I had to bring this,"" he says, pointing to a beautiful, vintage cream Daimler.

We wind down narrow, pine-flanked roads until we arrive at a collection of holiday cottages grouped around a Georgian country house. The morning air is fresh, clouds stretch across a blue sky and the only noise comes from the birds and wind in the trees. The house itself is a treasure, restored and stripped back by the pair, who have the stylist's knack for coupling antiques with modern classics. In the sitting room, there's a fire in the grate, books on the shelves and whisky in the cabinet, while the elegant staircase leads to four large bedrooms (plus a single) and a drawing room. Guests can also stay in cute self-catering cottages with log fires, comfy beds and 50s kitsch.

I spend the day reading next to the fire and walking around the sparkling water of a nearby loch and, by early evening, meet the other guests: nursery teacher Louise from south London, and Fiona and Michael, a jovial couple from Elie, who run a shop named, excellently, Feather Your Nest.

Unsurprisingly, they take to the first ukulele session like ducks to water and Louise has even done it before. Despite my obvious ineptitude, Scottish folk musician Hector MacInnes is patient and, when it is over, the session does seem to have worked some magic. As we gather around the huge kitchen table, it is as though, disconcertingly, we've been transformed into friends via the power of the uke – and the effects of a startlingly good dinner. This involves a perfectly balanced salad of pomegranate, goats cheese and candied walnuts, followed by melt-in-the-mouth shin of beef and fondant potatoes, and finished with one of my favourites: lemon posset.

The next day starts early with ""seasonal"" yoga run by the beatific Dominque Picot. With the fire crackling and the sky slowly awakening outside, we rub our kidneys and stretch out our stress. Previously, trying to find inner peace in a draughty sports hall has proved beyond my capabilities. But here, somehow, it happens. Remember, Dominique says, the peace you feel now is always inside you. I feel strangely emotional afterwards, happy to have a few moments of fireside solitude before the next activity.

During our bread-making class, run by chef and baker Pamela Brunton, we learn about the alchemy of yeast, enzymes and glutens, and I'm left with two overriding impressions. One: making sourdough takes a very long time. Two: it is worth it. I suspect I am too impatient to ever make my own again, but I'm delighted when it's served in abundance at lunch, alongside homemade soup, local cheese and ham.

Polly and Ross, whose warmth and generosity of spirit bind this weekend like the glutens in the sourdough, took over the running of the Dell a few years ago after overseeing a hotel in Bali and their own restaurant in Aviemore. The pair are full of ideas for the future, with forthcoming workshops offering woodland yoga, a masterclass in fruit and vegetable growing and acapella singing, as well as a paddle on the Spey.

The key is that the activities draw you into the surroundings, engage you over dinner, and stimulate mind and body. After yoga on Sunday, we get on mountain bikes and spend an exhilarating few hours going through the forest. ""I think people are starting to realise that checking your phone all the time doesn't make you feel great,"" says Louise. ""This,"" she adds, spraying through mud, ""makes you feel great.""

I leave slightly less cynical, and more rested, than when I arrived. Did I find the good life? Well, I laughed a lot, ate and drank well, slept, and learned new things – even if mastering the uke was an ask too far. If that's not the good life, it's certainly pretty close.

1343,"You have to pay to see the pavilions in Venice's Biennale of Architecture , which opened on Saturday. But there are many other stunning works of art around the city that you can enjoy for free

Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore

The island of San Giorgio has the ultimate views in Venice - looking out over the the Doges Palace and the Grand Canal - and the landmark church, designed in 1555 by Andrea Palladio, is a must-see. There is no charge to go inside the chiesa, whose rather stark interior has two important works by Tintoretto – L'Ultima Cena and Il Cader della Manna – as well as paintings by Carpaccio and Palma. There is a lift that takes you up to the top of the bell tower for €5 that has none of the long queues choking St Mark's campanile (which costs €8), and, frankly, the panorama is far more impressive from San Giorgio. The church's monastery and gardens belong to the Cini Foundation, which organises free exhibitions in Le Stanze del Vetro, and, for the duration of the Biennale, there is a stunning installation of gold pillars by the vaporetto stop by German architect Heinz Mack.

• Open daily from 9.30am-6.30pm. Vaporetto: San Giorgio

Casino Venier

Photograph: John Brunton

In the 18th century, at the time of Giacomo Casanova, there were well over 100 casini dotted around Venice – sumptuous, intimate salons in which the aristocracy met, danced, flirted and, above all, gambled. One of the most exquisite can still be visited as it is now the premises of French cultural centre L'Alliance Francaise. Casino Venier dates back to 1750 and occupies the first floor of a nondescript building looking out over the narrow Barateri Canal. As you walk up the ancient staircase and push open the heavy door, nothing prepares you for the opulent decor of the main salon: the marble-floored Casino is a riot of opulent stucco, frescoes and Murano mirrors, and, today, is occasionally used as a venue for art exhibitions.

• 4939 Ponte dei Bareteri, San Marco. Open Mon-Fri 9am-1pm and 3pm-6pm. Vaporetto Rialto

Scala Contarini del Bovolo

Photograph: Alamy

The so-called Snail Staircase must rank as one of the best hidden sights to track down in Venice, lost in a maze of narrow streets not far from the Rialto. From Campo San Bartolomeo, at the foot of the Rialto bridge, follow the yellow signs for Accademia till you reach Campo Manin, where a small panel that is very easy to miss points in the direction of the Scala. After zigzagging right and left, you suddenly come out in a tiny courtyard that is totally dominated by a towering staircase of spiraling, swirling arches. The palace itself, built for the Contarini family in the 14th century, is unremarkable from the outside, while this remarkable Gothic staircase was tacked on to the outside in 1499.

• 4299 Corte dei Risi, San Marco. Vaporetto: Rialto

I Gesuiti

Photograph: John Brunton

Although officially the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta, this grandiose baroque church is known by the name of the Jesuit Order which ordered its construction in 1715. Not only is there no entrance charge, but the Gesuiti boasts an important collection of paintings and trompe l'oeil sculptures. In the main church, you can see works by Titian and Tintoretto, who lived nearby, while the Sacristy has 20 paintings by Jacopo Palma il Giovane. Next door is a former Jesuit monastery, which, after being converted into a school, hospital and then military barracks, has recently been brought back to life as student lodgings, with the cloisters and a cafe now open to the public.

• Campo dei Gesuiti, Cannaregio. Open daily 10am-12pm, 4pm-6pm. Vaporetto:Fondamente Nove

Santa Maria della Salute

Santa Maria della Salute Photograph: John Brunton

Dominating the entrance to the Grand Canal and known simply as the Salute, this is one of the favourite churches of Venetians. Built in 1681 to mark the survival of the Serenissima from a deadly outbreak of the plague, the Salute's monumental baroque facade and dome, by architect Baldassare Longhena, is an icon on the Venice skyline. But there are also important artworks within, including paintings by both Titian and Tintoretto, and a pontoon bridge is strung across the Grand Canal in front of the church to allow worshippers to cross over to celebrate the Festa della Salute.

• Fondamenta della Salute, Dorsoduro. Open daily 9am-12pm, 3pm-5.30pm. Vaporetto: Salute

Orsoni Colour Library

Photograph: John Brunton

Tucked away in a quiet backstreet of Cannaregio, not far from the ancient Jewish Ghetto, is the only working glass furnace left in Venice, producing exquisite smalto (glass mosaics) – and gold leaf that have been used in some of the world's most famous buildings – St Paul's Cathedral, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, the Sacre Coeur in Paris – and the Basilica of San Marco. You can call in advance for a free tour of the workshop, which includes an explanation of how smalto is made, followed by a visit to the magical Colour Library, a collection of thousands of pieces of glass in different shades and nuances.

• 1045 Corte dei Vedei, Cannaregio, +39 041 2440002, orsoni.com. Vaporetto: Guglie

Sala San Marco Biblioteca

Sala San Marco Biblioteca Photograph: John Brunton

No one wants to visit a hospital when on holiday, but Venice's Ospedale Civile is like no other. Housed in the immense 15th-century Scuola Grande di San Marco, its ornate wedding cake facade dominates the San Giovanni e Paolo Campo, and once you walk through the grand entrance hall with its intricate marble floor, there is an ancient cloister and gardens. But recently, the first floor Sala San Marco has been opened to the public, housing a vast medical library, a quite terrifying collection of historical medical instruments and illustrations, and excellent reproductions of masterpieces by the likes of Bellini, Donato and Tintoretto that were originally painted for the Sala, but are now mostly on display in the Accademia gallery.

• Ospedale Civile, Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo, Cannaregio. Open Tues-Sat 9.30am-12.30pm, 2pm-5pm. Vaporetto: Fondamente Nove

San Michele Cemetery

Photograph: unknown/John Brunton

From the vaporetto stop at Fondamente Nove, it takes just a couple of minutes to reach the red-brick walls and tall cypress trees that encircle Venice's cemetery on the island of San Michele. While most tourists carry on to the next stop, the glass-blowing island of Murano, it is well worth taking a break at San Michele. The island's church is magnificent, designed in distinctive Istrian marble by the Renaissance architect, Mauro Codussi, in 1469, with peaceful cloisters and gardens, though most of its famous paintings have disappeared to museum collections. The cemetery is a much more recent early 19th-century creation, and although there are several famous graves – Ezra Pound and Joseph Brodsky, Diaghilev and Igor Stravinsky – there are also statues on tombs of gondoliers, and a Protestant section with graves of Grand Tour travellers who ended their journey in Venice.

• Isola di San Michele. Open daily 7.30am-6pm. Vaporetto: Cimitero

Casa di Tintoretto

Photograph: John Brunton

Although there is a plaque outside, it is not possible to go in and visit the grand palazzo where Jacopo Tintoretto lived and painted. But this offbeat corner of Cannaregio is worth seeking out for a number of uniquely Venetian oddities. The corner of Fondamenta dei Mori is marked by distinctive white statue with a metal nose, the Greek trader Rioba, while by the entrance to Tintoretto's house is another flamboyant statue of a turbaned Moorish trader. On the ground floor of the house is the Bottega del Tintoretto, a print studio run by friendly local artist Roberto Mazzetto, which is open to visitors. More Moorish statues decorate the Campo dei Mori and, walking over a bridge to the Madonna dell'Orto church, on the back of Tintoretto's house there is another strange frieze, an Arab trader leading a huge camel. Tintoretto is buried in Madonno dell'Orto, which displays several of his paintings, but there is an entry charge.

• 3400 Fondamenta dei Mor. Vaporetto: Orto

Basilica di San Marco

Photograph: John Brunton

Although it is easy to get the impression that almost everything in Venice seems to have an admission fee, it comes as a surprise that the Serenissima's most famous attraction, the Basilica di San Marco, does not charge visitors. Dominating the Piazza San Marco with its fairytale facade – though be prepared for at least part to be covered for renovation – the basilica is the ultimate symbol of Venice's former glory, and the domed interiors are marked by breathtaking intricate mosaics. Be aware, though, that once inside, there are fees if you want a tour of St Mark's Museum, the Treasury or the lustrous Pala d'Oro

• Piazza San Marco, basilicasanmarco.it. Open Mon-Sat 9.45am-5pm, Sunday 2pm-4pm. Vaporetto: San Marco Vallaresso

1345,"Bargain restaurants are harder to come by in remote Manaus, bang in the middle of the Amazon, where England kick off on Saturday. But we track down the tastiest and most affordable bites and bars for pre- and post-match refuelling

Bar do Armando

Within warbling distance of the Teatro Amazonas – the opulent opera house built with the spoils of the city's late 19th-century rubber boom – Bar do Armando is in the colonial heart of Manaus. Set in a listed single-storey building, with its façade painted salmon-pink, this no-frills watering hole is always packed with locals, both young and old. The best (plastic) seats in the house are out on the pavement, away from the bright fluorescent light and steamy temperatures inside. To drink, run-of-the-mill big-brand beers are served ice-cold in large 600ml bottles (Original is the best of the bunch), while to eat, the sanduíche de pernil - roast pork sandwich (R$15, around £4) – has won local awards, with thick slices of meat crammed inside a crusty roll. The good times here came to a halt for a while when the elderly owner Armando passed away in 2012. His daughter Ana Cláudia and her husband are now at the helm.

Tacacá da Gisela

Tacaca da Gisela, Manaus Photograph: facebook.com/tacaca.gisela/photos

More than a simple street stall, Tacacá da Gisela is a permanent fixture in the square opposite the Teatro Amazonas, with ornate green columns and a smart tiled roof. Locals as well as tourists stop by for a fix of its eponymous dish – tacacá, a tangy broth and a popular street food, that will surprise even the most worldly of palates. Served in a cuia gourd bowl where dried shrimp, lip-numbing jambu leaves (a local herb) and gloopy manioc gum all swim about in a sharp yellow broth (tucupi) extracted from manioc root; ask for it ""sem goma"", if you're squeamish about slime. For extra kick, load up on the homemade chilli sauce – a blend of murupi chillies and tucupi. The owners, the charming Joaquim and his wife Rosa Maria, are there every day from 4pm-10pm, and invite a roster of local musicians to play bossa nova on Wednesday nights. Another popular place to try tacacá is at Tacacá da Tia Socorro, not far from the Fifa Fan Fest in Ponta Negra.

Café Regional Priscila

The eponymous Priscila started out with a cafe in the neighbouring town of Rio Preta da Eva, some 80km from Manaus, before expanding into the Amazonas state capital, where there are now six cafes carrying her name. They all serve up ""café regional"" – a standard breakfast menu found in most local market stalls and cafes, where Amazonian ingredients are transformed into all manner of juices, cakes, corn patties and toasted sandwiches. The largest branch of Priscila's, in Parque das Laranjeiras, is a no-frills, open-sided space on a traffic-heavy road, and a good way to kick start the day in local fashion. Sit near the flat-topped oven for a ring-side view of tapioca flour being melted into pancakes and stuffed with any number of ingredients; try Brazil nuts with slices of the bizarrely salty orange palm fruit tucumã (£5, serves three). The fruit is also wedged into a roll with cheese and banana in the x-caboquinho toasted sandwich (£2.50).

Estória de Pescador

Estória de Pescador, Manaus Photograph: facebook.com/estoriadepescador/photos_all

A bright, sparsely decorated, family-run peixaria (fish stall), Estória de Pescador has been gathering steam since it opened last August (prior to that, it just did delivery). Set opposite a school (Colégio Lato Sensu), in an upmarket, low-rise neighbourhood, the restaurant is a favourite with families, and school kids during the week. The lunch buffet (£9 all you can eat, or £12 a kilo) saves foreign clientele the challenge of deciphering the menu; grab a plate and just load up on the dozen or more local fish dishes, like pirarucu de casaca (shredded pirarucu fish baked with plantain and a topping of potato crisps) and fried tambaqui fish. In the evenings, mains on the à la carte menu start from £10.50 and serve two.

Waku Sese Amazônia

Waku Sese Amazônia, Manaus.

Chain restaurants don't have to be awful, and Waku Sese is testament to that. What started out as a restaurant serving regional cuisine and frozen açaí – the Amazonian berry hyped with ""superfood status"" – in the bohemian neighbourhood of Vieiralves over 10 years ago is now a franchising hit. The formula: excellent açaí (it beats the competition hands down in local food awards) and bold branding that matches the berry's deep purple hue. At the kiosks, dotted around town, the frozen gloop is served in plastic cups (£1.80-£2.30); customers help themselves to toppings (chopped peanuts, cashews and crunchy tapioca flour balance out the sweetness). There are also three cafes and a restaurant (two in Manauara Shopping, one in Amazonas Shopping, and a pleasant street-level location with outside seating in Vieiralves) that serve hearty local dishes such as bean soup (£4.70), stuffed tapioca pancakes (£1.30-£3.70) and grilled fish – the roast matrinxã with rice, beans and farofa (toasted manioc with Brazil nuts and banana) is a good choice (£15.50 for 3 people).

Banzeiro

Fish ribs at Banzeiro

While it's up there with the more expensive of the city's restaurants, Banzeiro deserves a mention for its sophisticated approach to Amazonian cuisine. Young chef Felipe Schaedler sources excellent quality fish – river giants like pirarucu and tambaqui – and serves them simply but impeccably. You can push the boat out, ordering starters (the fried squares of tapioca with a tangy cupuaçu fruit and murupi chilli jam are a delight) and pricey wines and caipirinhas, or just keep it simple with a main course, all of which serve two generously. The tambaqui ribs (yes, fish ribs, and a similar size to pork ribs) are served grilled (£29) or with a Brazil nut crust and roasted bananas (£25). Banzeiro is only let down by its decor – a scattering of handicrafts do little to liven up a bland airport-lounge-style space, where the strip lighting could be turned down a notch.

Peixaria da Bia

Buzzing mid-week with workers from the nearby Ceasa port – a jumping-off point for car ferries, and tourist boats heading out to the Meeting of the Waters – Peixaria da Bia is a no-frills lunch favourite in the city's industrial district. Head up the tiled steps to the first-floor space, where wall-to-wall metal shutters are rolled up during the day, revealing commanding views out over the vast river. It's all about local fish here, served fried, roasted, stewed (caldeirada) or as escabeche (with a tomato, onion and herb sauce). PFs (pratos feitos) are bargain worker's meals-for-one (£4) served with rice, beans and vinaigrette and farofa (toasted manioc flour). The friendly owner Bia, who holds court by the cash register, also serves roast tambaqui at the weekends (reservations recommended).

Touch Down Game Bar

Touch Down Game Bar, Manaus Photograph: facebook.com/touchdownmanaus

A couple of years in business, the immense Touch Down Game Bar does exactly what it says on the tin: a sports bar pushing the American football theme in a big way. Big, as in 30ft high, with a football helmet and goal posts adorning the white two-storey exterior; while inside, framed football memorabilia and waiters decked out as referees continue the theme. Two large screens and 21 flatscreens are perpetually tuned to sport, be it baseball, hockey and – of course – football during the World Cup. Novelty drinks include frozen fishbowl margaritas (£21, serves four) and chope suja brahama (shandy with a salt rim, £2), while the menu is standard Americana, with the likes of hot dogs (£5-£7.30), burgers (£6.50-£8.30) and pork ribs (£11.80, serves two).

Belle Epoque Bistrô Cocktail Bar

Tramping the soulless corridors of a shopping centre might not be everyone's idea of a good night out, but it's often the easy option in big Brazilian cities, where air-con, thousands of car-parking spaces and a roster of top chefs under one roof all add to the convenience. Belle Époque, in Shopping Ponta Negra – a swish mall that opened last year – is a diminutive bistro with a double-height bar as its centrepiece. During the week, the set lunch includes French classics like steak and chips (£9-£11.80), with à la carte fish mains starting from around £10.50. A roster of interesting Amazonian fruits goes into the creative if pricey cocktail menu, devised by São Paulo's top mixologist Marcelo Serrano. Don't miss the Manauara cocktail (£5.50), with vodka, Frangelico, chocolate bitter and pulp from the sour, pungent Amazonian fruit cupuaçu with a jambu foam.

Cachaçaria do Dedé

Cachaçaria do Dedé, Manaus Photograph: facebook.com/cachacariadodede

There's something of a wild-west feel to this spacious tavern, with its weather-worn wooden veranda and a six-foot barrel positioned out front. Groups of twenty- and thirtysomethings gather at the street-side tables, while the upstairs seating has a more subdued vibe (and air-conditioning). The food, as in almost every bar across Brazil, is not designed for the solo drinker. Kick off with portions of classic fried bar snacks: the crispy salt-cod balls (bolinhos de bachalau, £6 for six) or the sun-dried beef and cream cheese pastries (pastéis de carne de sol com Catupiry, £5.70 for 10) are both excellent. Generous mains include the Escondidinho do Dedé – a sun-dried beef and cheese pie with a manioc mash topping (£10 serves two). A tipple or two of cachaça is a must: they have over 900 labels here, many of which line the walls, with comedy names and labels proudly on display. Take the edge off the spirit with a caipilé (£3.90) – a strawberry, kiwi or pineapple caipirinha with an ice lolly wedged in on top.

1349,"Akyaka is close to familiar Turkish resorts, but it feels a world away. Rachel Dixon enjoys a scenic retreat just starting to make its mark with foodies and nature lovers

Over a leisurely breakfast by the Kadın Azmak river in Akyaka, south-western Turkey, it is difficult to imagine anything disturbing the peace. Ducks and geese jostle for bread, dark shoals of fish swim past and bright green waterweed waves in the slow-moving water, which is fed by icy springs.

But this tiny town – population about 2,500 – on the southern Aegean coast is not far from some much noisier neighbours: Bodrum and Marmaris, two of the largest resorts in Turkey. Perhaps it was the cautionary tale of these tourist hotspots that prompted the then mayor, Ahmet Çalça, to join the international Cittaslow movement in 2011, making Akyaka the second ""slow town"" in Turkey (there are now nine).

As well as celebrating Akyaka's slower pace of life, Çalça hoped membership of Cittaslow would help preserve his town's unique culture, architecture and environment. ""Akyaka is my heart,"" he says. He welcomes tourism – visitor numbers are at 100,000 a year, compared with 15,000 10 years ago – but wants growth to be sustainable. Akyaka is already a favourite destination for holidaying Turks. At the Otel Azmakhan (azmakhan.com.tr), where I stayed, 90% of guests are Turkish. But despite being only an hour away from Dalaman airport (itself a three-and-a-half-hour flight from London), it has yet to be discovered by many Brits.

This is bound to change, because the town has a lot to offer foodies, nature lovers and architecture buffs. The river and a wetland conservation area form a picturesque eastern boundary; it is a 10-minute walk along its banks to the lower, more touristy, half of town, around the harbour and beach. Protected forests lie to the north and west, with mountains beyond. Upper Akyaka is the working part of town, with a small market, fishmonger, butcher and baker, and coffee houses full of men playing tavla (backgammon).

In the 1970s, architect Nail Çakırhan restored the town's old houses and built new ones in a blend of traditional Ottoman/Turkish/Aegean architecture, which developed into a style unique to Akyaka. The buildings have ornate, pine-timbered eaves and balconies with whitewashed walls and red roofs. Çakırhan won the prestigious Aga Khan award for Islamic architecture in 1983, largely for his work in Akyaka, and today all new buildings must adhere to the style.

As well as its physical charms, Akyaka has a growing reputation for food, based around vegetables and fish. Nadir Usta'nin Yeri (nadirusta.com), where I breakfasted each day, is just one of several fish restaurants along the river. All are wonderfully atmospheric, with wooden terraces built over the water and lights strung in the trees. The original and best is Halil In Yeri (halilinyeri.com.tr), which serves incredible meze – stuffed pumpkin flowers, pickled sea beans – and uses olive oil and lemons from its own organic groves. Diners select their main course from the wet fish counter: I tried crispy little red mullet and delicate sea bass. Dessert might be a gorgeously gooey plate of halva or sticky candied figs and quince (around £40 for two, including wine). It is a great introduction to the town's slow-food culture.

If you tire of fish, dozens of restaurants in lower Akyaka offer more variety. They include some ev yemekleri (home cooking) cafes, part of a recent trend away from fine dining. Ayse Ananin Yeri , for example, serves simple soups, stews and manti (Turkish ravioli) for a few lira. In no-nonsense upper Akyaka, Kristal is a good stop for a spicy Adana kebab and a cold Efes beer (about £17 for two).

Back by the river, Mocca, a brand new cafe and bistro, is one of the nicest spots for a tiny cup of strong coffee and some Turkish delight (for under £1). The friendly owner invited me to a party there after a five-minute chat. At the Olive Farm shop on the same premises, you can pick up some local olive oil and olive-based soaps.

Bars are concentrated in lower Akyaka, with several lining one street, Karanfil Sokak. Elsewhere, Feronia (feronclub.com) has the best wine list, with lots of excellent Turkish wines available by the glass (from about £2.50). Mev is probably the buzziest beachfront bar, though the Yucelen Otel (gokovayucelen.com) at the western end of the beach has a rooftop bar from which to watch the sunset.

Akyaka's waterfront and the Azmak river

An even better view can be had from the top of the Sakartepe mountain, which towers over Akyaka. A rough track off the main road to Mugla leads to a vantage point with a vista over the town and the whole of Gokova Bay. Legend has it that on seeing the view, the writer Cevat Sakir Kabaagaçlı said: ""See Rome and die; see Gokova and live."" (Though be careful on the drive back down: sakar translates as ""clumsy"", so called because of the number of accidents on the twisting mountain road.)

Boats chug up the river on otter-spotting excursions, but I hired a kayak instead from a rental company at the end of the beach. Fatih Sahin, a young lawyer and Akyaka local, offered to guide me on an early-morning trip. After a paddle across the shallow bay, we headed upstream. Fatih pointed out the town's ""swimming pool"", a circular bulge in the river bank. We didn't spot any otters, but it was great to get out on the river, the heart of Akyaka, on whose banks local families picnic and couples sit as evening falls.

The town beach has hard-packed, greyish sand, but enchanting Cinar beach is a short drive (or long walk) away. The beach itself is pebbly, but the setting more than makes up for it: a secluded cove surrounded by forested mountains, with a little creek and a single beach bar, whose deck makes a great sunbathing spot.

You can also take a boat trip from Akyaka to ""Cleopatra's beach"" on nearby Sedir island. It is said that Mark Antony brought the sand from Egypt, and its bright golden colour is certainly unlike that of any other beach in the area. Sedir island also has some Hellenic and Roman ruins, including a beautifully situated amphitheatre, where olive trees have grown through the stones. The trip takes a full day, with several stops at scenic swimming spots (£8.50 including lunch); a number of boats leave from the harbour each morning.

From Akyaka you can take a dolmus (public minibus) to Mugla, which has the largest market in the region (every Thursday), or drive to the ruined city of Ephesus; the pretty hill village of Sirince; and busy Bodrum, which manages to retain some charm despite all the development.

There are plenty of hotels and apartments in town, but I liked the riverside location of the Azmakhan. It is a simple, 20-room, three-star hotel with a lovely pool, Akyaka's only gym, and a hammam where I was expertly scrubbed, soaped and massaged. For those in search of a little more luxury, the owners are building a boutique hotel, Azmakhan Deluxe, that is due to open in July.

The architect of the new establishment told me he was worried about designing such a big hotel. It turns out it will have a whopping 40 rooms. Looks like the mayor doesn't have anything to worry about just yet.

After 14 years of false starts, Athens' first modern art museum (EMST) launches this summer (date to be confirmed). It's in the old Fix brewery, a modernist landmark with a 92-metre facade of horizontal windows. The unveiling of the permanent collection is hotly anticipated. It includes works by more than 100 artists, from Jannis Kounellis to Bill Viola Diohanti (who represented Greece at the 2011 Venice Biennale). Eventually, a promenade will connect EMST to the Acropolis Museum nearby.

1353,"Thessaloniki, Greece

More manageable and welcoming than Athens, Greece's second city is something of an open-air museum, with Byzantine and Ottoman sites aplenty. The Ano Poli, or Upper Town, is a charmer with its colourful old houses, parks and squares. Traditional ouzeries rub shoulders with modern hotels; buzzy cafes and restaurants line the waterfront and the big student population ensures a lively nightlife. A good dose of culture (the annual film festival draws crowds, and many poets and musicians hail from here), helps make Thessaloniki the country's hippest city. Halkidiki's beaches, a wide choice of flights from the UK, value for money and a growing foodie scene up the appeal.

Sleep

The boutique City Hotel (doubles from €70) is slap bang in the middle of it all, near the main square, Plateia Aristotelous, and has green credentials and a design ethos that aims to bring nature into the city (think leaf-motify wallpapers and natural wood). The result is a calming contemporary space, and there's a spa for recharging after sightseeing too.

Eat

Visitors can let their tastebuds loose on all manner of eateries. Nea Folia (Aristomenous 4, +30 2310 960383) is a tiny taverna where the young chefs give traditional Turkish treats a modern twist – try the sweet and spicy kopsidia, a tastily seasoned dish of grilled pork. Options in the trendy waterfront Ladadika district include Paparouna with its seasonal menu appealing to a young crowd. There are many more places to refuel within the Byzantine walls, a short walk to the north.

Drink

The narrow streets of the central Valaoritou district are the city's nightlife hub, and you'll hang with the city's cool cats on the rooftop of Fragile Bar (Valaoritou Caddesi 29). It has wooden boxes instead of chairs, film projections and DJs). Inside it's all corkboard and graffiti-covered walls; there's no cocktail menu, so just tell the waiter what you fancy drinking. The seafront is alive with bars too – try Thermaikos Cafe Bar (Leoforos Nikis Caddesi 21) for local DJ sets and an upbeat vibe.

See

The recently renovated White Tower, built as an Ottoman fort in 1535, is the city's most recognised landmark and home to the Museum of the City of Thessasloniki (€3, under-18s free). Climb to the viewing platform at the top of the 34m-high circular structure for the sweeping city panoramas.

Nafplio, Greece

Pension Marianna, Nafplio

Three hours by car from Athens on the easternmost part of the Peloponnese peninsula, romantic Nafplio is known as the proposal capital of Greece – and for good reason. A compact historic port city, with the dramatic Palamidi fortress as a backdrop, it has pretty streets lined with elegant Venetian and Turkish buildings twisting away from central, marble-paved Syntagma Square. The first capital of independent Greece (in 1829), it is now a favourite with weekending Athenians, who come for the laid-back vibe, waterside cafes, great restaurants and posh boutique shopping. There's not much in the way of beach but the sandy resorts of Tolo and Karathona are close by and the ancient city of Mycenae and the still-used outdoor theatre of Epidaurus are just a few miles out of town.

Sleep

For breakfast with a view, check into delightful Pension Marianna (doubles from €70) in the old town – the terrace overlooks the terracotta roofscape and the sea beyond. Run by two brothers, the old Ottoman house abuts the walls of the Akronafplia castle, and the 21 rooms, spread over three levels, are in characterful stone and wood and spotlessly clean (though the views from the communal spaces are better).

Eat

For top-notch, authentic Greek grub you are really spoilt for choice in Nafplio. At family-run Noulis Restaurant (22 Moutzouridou Street, +30 275 202 5541), chef Noulis Andrianopoulos is in the kitchen, cooking with home-grown veg, his daughter waits tables and his wife makes the desserts such as local delicacy galaktoboureko. The place is always crowded with people feasting on the freshest of classic meze dishes (fried saganaki cheese flambéd in Metaxa brandy at your table is a speciality).

Drink

Cafe culture is big news. Be sure to try Karonis ouzo, made to the same recipe since 1869 in a distillery near the fortress (it has a museum and offers guided tours of its stills). If you fancy something more refined, head to 3Sixty, a sleek bar (and restaurant) just off the main square, offering the very best Peloponnesian wines, as well as inventive cocktails.

See

Bearing witness to Nafplio's rich history, the fortresses are the town's key sights. Catch a boat taxi from the harbourfront to Bourtzi, built by the Venetians on an islet in the harbour.

Izmir, Turkey

On a bay in the south Aegean, backed by mountains, Turkey's third-largest metropolis centres around Konak Meydanı, a spacious curved square with a clock tower and one side open to the sea. Most of the ancient city of Smyrna was destroyed in a fire in 1922 so this is not the most picturesque of cities. (Many visitors whizz through on their way to Ephesus and Pergamon.) But it is worth lingering for a true glimpse of modern Turkey. Sit at a waterfront cafe and watch the mix of headscarfed women, girls in skimpy shorts and men in suits passing by or lingering over beer and backgammon. Discover inviting restaurants in old houses in the Alsancak district, get lost in the colourful bazaars and take the Ansansor, the free lift to the cliff-top for bay views (in this super hilly city it will save your legs).

Sleep

A former 1950's bank right on the waterfront, the Key Hotel (doubles from €115) is all glass elevators, black floors and hi-tech features – not your traditional Turkish crashpad. You'll see your fair share of suits, but the 34 rooms are spacious and slick (most overlooking the sea), the minibar is complimentary (soft drinks only) and the decent breakfast and highly rated restaurant make it a good option for holidaymakers too.

Eat

The waterfront is the place for sunset dining. Barbecued catch of the day is cooked on fishing boats and served on chunks of white bread. Midye dolmasi (mussels stuffed with rice and pine nuts) or kumru (sesame bread stuffed with cheese, tomato and sausage) are mouthwatering and very cheap. If you prefer to sit and linger, try for a seat at Kordonboyu for generous portions of seafood.

Drink

You can easily cafe-hop around town, sipping hardcore coffee boiled in the cup but for something stronger (in an alcohol-y way), check out the bars that have sprung up in the old terraced houses on Alsancak's cobbled streets, where bars such as Sardunya are a good place to join the locals for an Efes beer. Many have live (rock) music, and food too.

See

Kemeraltı bazaar is a network of narrow passageways and crumbling arcades around a number of Ottoman-era mosques – notably the Hisar Camii, with its intricate Islamic artwork. Dive in and get lost, picking up bargains on the way (leather goods and jewellery in particular). The flower market is photogenic and there are numerous courtyard cafes.

Ankara, Turkey

Declared the capital by Turkey's first president, Musfafa Kemal Atatürk, in 1923, Ankara has morphed into a vibrant modern city, but one still with reminders of its ancient past. Standing on a hill above the Enguri Su river, it may play second fiddle to Istanbul for most, but it's the country's cultural centre, with endless concerts and festivals, and cafe fever is rife on its wide streets. Genclik park offers a green lung, and prices are generally wallet-friendly.

Sleep

A 16th-century caravanserai, Divan Cukurhan (doubles from €85) is a 19-room boutique hotel opposite the citadel that combines historic charm and modern comfort. The central courtyard has been glassed over, but original features remain throughout. It feels a bit like staying in a museum – in a good way. Room are spacious, all different, and many have great views.

Eat

Street stalls and hawkers all over town offer doner and classic iskender kebabs – watch where the locals go and join the queue. Perhaps surprisingly, given its location in central Anatolia, Ankara's fish restaurants are among the best in the country. Sakarya Caddesi in the busy Kizilay district has fish-eating opportunities for all budgets – be sure to order rakı with it. Trilye in the smart Gaziosmanpasa district is a favourite for fishy fine dining.

Drink

Nightlife is more about bars than clubs. Papsi (Tunali Hilmi Cad, 68/C) is a popular pub with a beer garden and an international clientele (there's a big diplomat ex-pat community) and Sakarya Caddesi is also lined with lively hangouts.

1355,"Wednesday evening, it's just before midnight and I'm in the Athens suburb of Glyfada. At Lemoni in Kyprou Street – the most popular of the new, post-crisis breed of taverna – there are few vacant tables. Out on the pavement, four tall pine trees are corseted in gold lights. Lavender and sweet peas spill from planter boxes made from Artemis wine crates. Greek couples and groups are smoking, sipping cloudy ouzo over shared platters; there are families with young children busting curfews.

A hundred metres further down the road, at Soleto, cafe society is at full tilt. Cars are double-parked (a bit of a Hellenic habit) and the trees are lit up like it's Christmas as Athenians venerate the holy trinity of life: caffeine, cigarettes, mobile phone. It's a scene full of kefi, a Greek word that means joyful spirits.

Something has changed of late. Two years ago, every visit to Glyfada (25 minutes from the Acropolis) meant seeing a freshly abandoned shopfront; now, the tumbleweed feeling has gone and there's a tangible pulse of optimism in this cosmopolitan, seaside town, capital of the Athenian Riviera.

Few visitors to Greece realise that less than 10 miles south of the city centre – and still defined as Greater Athens – lies this photogenic stretch of mountains, mineral lakes, seaside resorts and sandy beaches with blue-flag certified clean waters. You won't find the ""Athenian Riviera"" on any Google map (yet); it's more of an idea. The words are local shorthand for the 35 miles of coastal road that connect the seaside retail hub of Glyfada to Cape Sounion and the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon on the Attica peninsula.

Between Glyfada and Cape Sounion is a run of characterful seaside towns, each with its own flavour, feeding directly off the coastline-hugging Poseidonos Avenue: Voula, Kavouri, Vouliagmeni, Varkiza, Agia Marina, Lagonissi, Anavysso, Saronida. At any one of them, you can experience the kind of island magic that many people come to Greece for, without having to set foot on a ferry: from shopping and nightlife in flamboyant Vouliagmeni to unspoiled craggy beaches in down-to-earth Agia Marina.

The drive from Glyfada to Sounion (just over an hour) has a coarse drama and stirring physicality reminiscent of Australia's Great Ocean Road. To your left, the landscape is by turns bucolic and resort-like. To your right, there's a constant, hypnotic sweep of Aegean Sea, the nearby Saronic Gulf islands etched coyly against the horizon.

Many of the most alluring stretches of this coast have been privatised, and beach access fees of €6-€8 are prohibitive to the average Greek on a monthly salary of €800 and one mayor went on a hunger strike against the carving up of prime coastline. So locals tend to seek out the free beaches (without facilities) or one of the numerous beach cafes, which will let you occupy a sun lounger for the price of a coffee or a toasted sandwich. Purists head for the scenic coves and headlands between Vouliagmeni and Agia Marina. In summer, look out for where Athenians have left their cars en masse by the side of the paraliaki (the main coast road) to reach the best local swimming spots below.

The Athenian Riviera's best asset is how off-grid it remains. Yes, there are the trophy venues such as Jackie Onassis's beloved Astir Palace resort in Vouliagmeni, but there is also a compelling rawness, an authenticity that you can't always find on more popular Greek islands, with their tourist hordes.

In most Athenian Riviera suburbs, ancient traditions such as the laiki agora (street markets), where you can come away with the week's news and a huge tub of Kalamata olives for a couple of euros, are still an essential way of life. And in the plateias (town squares), there are still places where two people can eat to bursting point and get change from €30.

I am frequently humbled by the generosity and neighbourly spirit of the working Greeks in the area. Recently, facing a €400 bill after a fulsome group dinner at one of our favourite spots, and a broken card machine, the owner shrugged easily. ""Don't worry,"" he said. ""Just come back and fix me up sometime next week."" Shop owners almost always take the time to chat with children (and ply them with sweets), or to help with the (unfortunately frequent) parking space predicaments.

There's also the sense of singular spots yet to be discovered. Last summer, our eighth here, we stumbled upon a wonderful secluded beach cafe bracketed by a pine-studded cove in Vouliagmeni. Even long-time locals can't agree on its exact name. All you need to know is that you take the third left after the Margi hotel at 11 Litous Street, then a short drive down a dirt track until you reach a canopy of Moncafe umbrellas.

There, you can snorkel in clear shallow waters surrounded by darting fish. Sit all day unharried over a lone frappe coffee. Or enjoy a lunch of fresh calamari and Greek salad while fishing boats bob and children lure baby crabs into buckets at the shoreline. All the time not quite believing that you're still in Athens.

GLYFADA

The upscale district of Glyfada, 16km from Athens, is the most commercial of the Riviera suburbs, thanks to the old airport and a former US military base, which cleared out in the 1990s. Because of its high density of cashed-up expats, pop stars and politicians, Glyfada is sometimes dubbed the Hellenic Hamptons. But its character is also strongly nuanced by the many Greek families who have lived here for generations – in the days when it was an unassuming seaside town (long before the tram line connected it to Syntagma Square and Piraeus in time for the 2004 Olympics).

What to do

The Balux leisure complex is one of the Riviera's best days out. Balux resembles something Richard Branson might have designed to entertain famous pals but with a democratic, welcoming feel and unexpectedly friendly rates (and door policy). The cavernous glass-fronted clubhouse is well-appointed for the ""all-day hang"", with rugs, rocking chairs, gaming stations and an inviting library annexe (and no one hassling you to buy anything). Entry and parking are free, although the plush loungers lining the beach (the best in Glyfada) cost about €8 to hire (including a drink). You can order wood-fired pizzas or sprawl on the lawn of the adults-only pool at the original Balux next door.

You'll definitely get a kick out of a night at one of the area's open-air cinemas. The main one, Alpha Odeon, has English-language screenings of mainstream films, usually starting around dusk at 9pm, with a second screening around 11pm. Just be prepared for the Greeks who see it as a social outing and continue to chat and use their phones.

Where to eat

A wave of enthusiastic, post-financial-crisis startups, particularly in the leafy side-pockets of Kyprou and Laodikis Streets and Esperidon Square, is creating a jazzy SoHo village heartbeat in Glyfada. Affordable and stylish new grillhouses such as Lemoni and Moouu Quality Meats, where a generous serving of sliced oyster blade steak costs just €10, are rapidly reinventing the straight-from-central-casting Greek taverna.

Springing up everywhere, too, are Manhattan-feel eateries and cosy microbars: Esperidon Square's Food Mafia, where the menu hero is the granulated burger; the Vein Cheese and Wine bar on Botsari (the baked katsikisio goat cheese with goji berry marmalade, €6, trumps all).

The main Glyfada laiki, held each Thursday along several blocks on Lazaraki Street, opposite Agiou Konstantinou cathedral, is a sensory – if chaotic – pleasure. Amid Mediterranean sound and fury, you will find Greek specialities such as mountain tea, honey, olive oil, or a dolmades roller for making your own stuffed vine leaves at home.

Where to stay

The modern, and bizarrely named, Congo Palace on Poseidonos Avenue, stands just across the road from the sea in central Glyfada. The pool area is large and lovely and there is a bus-stop directly outside the hotel with connections to Athens city centre.

VOULIAGMENI

Ten minutes down the coast is Vouliagmeni, the Riviera's crown jewel and probably the best place to base yourself for a longer holiday. With its manicured boulevards, private beaches and nautical clubs, compact Vouliagmeni is easily the most self-aware Riviera postcode. But it's also a great natural beauty that can be explored on foot.

What to do

There are numerous scenic trails: some on Mount Hymettus directly above the main cafe strip, another tracing the green curves of the Astir Palace peninsula. Meanwhile, Lake Vouliagmeni, almost hidden from view behind Poseidonos Avenue, is a natural treasure that is bewilderingly under-promoted. Open year-round, the lake is a vast sunken limestone cave fed by underground mineral currents, and at a constant 24C. Many locals gripe about the €8 entrance but wading through the brackish grottos, with tiny black fish (kalogries) nudging your toes, you feel like you're in an exclusive spa town.

Where to eat

Directly opposite the lake is Labros, a fish restaurant that has been a Vouliagmeni institution since 1889. You get get prime views of Vouliagmeni Bay from the roomy terrace. The statement dishes, midopilafo (mussel rice with raisins and pine nuts) and garithes saganaki (shrimp pan-fried with tomato and feta), are consistently good (a meal for two with wine costs around €45-€50) and there is the added entertainment of watching young Greeks cliff-bomb from the taverna's popular diving rocks.

Just around the bay in Kavouri, beachfront Garbi restaurant has a loyal following thanks to its potent sunset views and outstanding meze. High notes are the wined eggplant, zucchini balls with avocado sauce, and grilled octopus (dinner for two with wine costs around €40). Two of the Riviera's nicest free beaches (Megalo Kavouri and Mikro Kavouri) are also in Kavouri, within walking distance of Vouliagmeni.

Where to stay

The Vouliagmeni Suites have a great central location, a nice pool and contemporary rooms. The Margi boutique hotel, in central Vouliagmeni, remains a top pick for glamour minus the price tag. In summer, the slick pool bar with its louche double loungers and super-size-me pillows becomes a destination in itself. Its just-launched Baku taverna also provides a welcome time-out, serving ""new Greek gourmet"" dishes such as lamb with chickpea puree and kalamon olives.

VARKIZA

People do swim in the sea in Glyfada. But most Greeks prefer to go further afield where the beaches face south and are more protected from Athens. In the shabby-chic fishing port of Varkiza, 17 miles south-east of Athens, you will find two of the best private beaches: Yabanaki and its neighbour, Varkiza Resort, both easily accessed by the E22 bus. They form a 500-metre sprawl of sandy beach with clean, shallow water. Yabanaki is a family-pleaser with excellent watersports, wide, grassy flanks and a superb taverna, Yalo Yalo (no phone, don't miss the €7 octopus meatballs). The smaller, hipper Varkiza Resort attracts more of a Mykonos crowd. At each beach, you pay around €7 to get in (less on weekdays). There's not much else to do here but that's part of the charm.

ANAVYSSOS

A rowdy long lunch by the sea is a summer weekend staple for Athenians and Anavyssos, 32 miles from the city, is a popular Sunday destination. The relaxed town is famous for two things: windsurfing and its seafront fish tavernas. You're in the right place when you spot the waiters endangering their lives by dashing across the street to collect orders from the kitchens.

The kingpin taverna is Akrogiali, where the hospitable Panayotis prides himself on the freshness of his barbouni (red mullet). Given its price of around €55 a kilo, though, you may want to stick with cheaper fish such as kolios (mackerel) or gavros (anchovies) – both delicious grilled or fried.

CAPE SOUNION

When ancient Athenians sailed home from battle, their first glimpse of civilisation was the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, erected around 440BC. With the actual temple now roped off, you may not be able to get close enough to read the swooning graffiti of Lord Byron, still visible among the Doric columns. But standing up there on a clear day, you can see the other two points of the Greeks' ""ancient holy triangle"", formed by the Acropolis, 44 miles away, and the Temple of Athena on the island of Aegina. There is a magnificent stillness at Sounion that you don't experience at the Parthenon.

Most Greeks avoid the temple cafe, scenic though it is, and eat at one of two tavernas on the small crescent of beach below. The upper one, Elias, gets the taxi drivers' vote. As you sit there at sunset, watching the seagulls wheel against Poseidon's silhouette, the contrast with Athens could not be greater. (Entrance to the Sounion ruins is €4.)

This is a sleepy, mostly residential, place, where the only overnighters tend to be honeymooners staying at the ritzy, modern Aegeon beach hoteldoubles from €110), sometimes after marrying in the shadow of the temple.

• Riviera fish restaurants price their speciality fish by the kilo (bones and all), which can blow the bill unexpectedly high. Most people find that half a kilo of fish, rather than a whole kilo, is sufficient for two people.

• When dining in fish tavernas, avoid ordering anything that once walked on land: the meat dishes here are often average. Carnivores should stick to the grill houses – where they use the best cuts for souvlaki, kontosouvli (rotisserie-cooked pork hunks) and kokoretsi (organ meats wrapped in intestines).

• Taxis in Athens are cheap and plentiful and most drivers speak basic English. Generally speaking, you should pay about €1 per minute. Taxi Beat is a free Greek phone app which you can use to contact your preferred driver. Several council-run bus lines also serve the coastal road. Pick up the Athens public transport pocket map at the airport when you land.

• The coast road gets jammed during summer weekends – especially on the sections around Varkiza and Vouliagmeni. Avoid typical Greek travel times by setting out from the capital no later than 9am.

• Some establishments claim not to accept credit cards and will insist on being paid in cash. Ask before ordering to spare embarrassment.",Greece road trip: the seaside idyll of the Athenian Riviera,http://www.theguardian.com,[],https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402583635135/Vouliagmeni-lake-017.jpg,2014-06-14 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jun/14/greece-road-trip-seaside-athens-riviera
1357,"Some Barcelonians of the 7.4 million visitors to a city of 1.7 million: 'we don't want this kind of tourism anymore'

The first cruise ship pulled into Barcelona's port at 5am. Over the next few hours, six more cruise ships – bearing names such as Liberty of the Seas and Grand Holiday – followed. On this warm Sunday last May, a record 31,000 tourists arrived by boat in Barcelona. Some were embarking or disembarking passengers, others dropped off thousands of tourists to spend a day in the Catalan capital. Estimates put the passengers' total spending at €3.5m (£2.8m) during the day; a figure that had local shopkeepers rubbing their hands in anticipation after being granted special permission to keep their shops open on a Sunday.

As thousands of tourists jammed the narrow streets of Barcelona's Gothic quarter or flooded into the famous La Sagrada Família basilica, neighbourhood associations warned that this onslaught was merely a sign of things to come. In mid-September, the world's biggest cruise ship will begin visiting Barcelona, and is expected to help bump cruise ship visitors to a new record of 58,000 in a two-day span.

While Madrid trumpets its record-breaking tourism numbers for 2013 and 2014, Barcelona is engaged in a different conversation about tourism. With the economic crisis apparently easing, the city is one of several Spanish hotspots looking for a way to manage the deluge of tourists.

Eduardo Chibás set out to capture this debate in his documentary Bye Bye Barcelona. ""I don't know one resident in Barcelona that in some way doesn't feel like there's something wrong with the amount of people who come here every year,"" he said.

The city's 1.6 million residents have seen the number of visitors to the city skyrocket from 1.7 million in 1990 to more than 7.4 million in 2012.

The starting point for this conversation, he stressed, is not anti-tourist.""We're all tourists, we like to visit other places and everyone acknowledges the fact that it creates jobs and can be a source of wealth."" But left unchecked, tourism can wreak havoc.

Once a city willing to do anything to attract tourist cash, residents now worry Barcelona is a vicitm of its success. ""This is not a city to live in. It's a theme park like Prague or Venice,"" one resident tells Chibás.

Failure to find a balance between tourists and residents, said Chibás, could erode the very charm that draws millions of foreigners to Barcelona each year. He pointed to the traditional shops that are being muscled out to make way for an ever-growing number of outlets catering to tourists. ""People live in these areas. What happens when everything around you turns into commerce for tourists? Basically it stops being a place where you can live.""

The most striking transformation can be found on La Rambla – a wide tree-lined boulevard where eight in every 10 pedestrians is a tourist. Gone are the bakeries, neighbourhood bars and traditional fruit and vegetable vendors . In their place, souvenirs shops and money changers sit side by side.

In Málaga, local officials have been paying close attention to Barcelona's dilemma. Previously a transit point to the Costa del Sol, in the last five years Málaga has become a tourist hub in its own right.

The number of bars and restaurants in the city centre has tripled from 200 to 600 in the last seven years, sending the number of residents in the area dropping by 10%. ""We have to act now,"" Pedro Marín of the Observatory of Urban Environment told the Guardian. ""We have to find an equilibrium so that it's not a nightmare to live in the historical centre.""

His group is calling for a moratorium on any new bars or restaurants in the city centre – a call backed by residents but decried by industry associations. Failure to control the situation at this point, warns Marín, ""runs the risk of turning the historical centre of Malaga into a theme park.""

He cited the story of one resident who came home one Friday evening to find that a table of four was happily dining while blocking the entrance way to her apartment. The diners initially refused to move, he said, until the owner of the restaurant intervened. ""One can make money but not at the cost of the life and health of the rest of us.""

In Palma de Mallorca, 30 years of tourism has fuelled a frank conversation about the type of tourist the city typically attracts, said the city's deputy mayor Álvaro Gijón.

For decades, the city has marketed itself as a cheap destination. The resulting tourists, said Gijón, are those who ""get drunk on the beach, drinking alcohol in front of everyone, singing like it was a permanent fiesta and throwing their glass bottles in the sand.""

City officials decided it was time to take action after locals began complaining about swimsuit-clad tourists visiting the cathedral, using public transit and entering shops, he said. ""We said to ourselves, we don't want this kind of tourist anymore. It wouldn't occur to us to go to Harrods in a wet bathing costume to go shopping, or to Piccadilly Circus and start singing in our swimsuits with 50 of our friends while drinking cheap alcohol out of a bucket.""

Last month, the city approved a civic law that imposes steep fines of up to €600 for a raft of behaviours deemed ""anti-social,"" including wearing bathing costumes outside the beach area, littering or jumping from one balcony to another or into swimming pools.

The crackdown on etiquette was necessary, said Gijón, as it complements a push by hoteliers to attract a different kind of clientele. ""We're not a luxury destination – we don't want to be the Costa Azul,"" he insisted.

While trying to attract a more upmarket type of tourist is a risk, it's one local officials are willing to take, said Gijón. ""We might lose the tourist that say, I'm going to Mallorca because I love to be drunk all day next to the beach. But we might get a family with two kids.""

1359,"Mercifully, the pirate ship is passing by far enough away as to not be heard. I wouldn't even have noticed it had I not looked up at that exact moment. And for that I blame the turtles – a pair of them bobbing along enticingly in front of me, asking to be followed, and then darting down through the endless blue to the sands far beneath, well beyond the range of my snorkel.

That pirate ship is a party boat, and it's as close as the resort of Ayia Napa comes to Cape Greco. Thank goodness for that. Because here at Cape Greco, some six miles east of the infamous square, with its bulging dance floors and laser lighting, is a paradise of unfeasibly blue water backed by a honeycomb coast of hidden caves and a national park.

Eastern Cyprus has always been acknowledged as having the best beaches, the most inviting waters. But to anyone who has winced at Ayia Napa Uncovered on TV, or arrived at Larnaca airport with groups of twenty-somethings in matching T-shirts and comedy hats, Ayia Napa means something very different indeed.

The clubbing crowds have been coming here since the mid-1980s, pushing the couples and families away to the west, mostly to Paphos, and its large, sandy beaches and child-friendly hotels. But today they are starting to return to the east, and to rediscover why tourism started here in the first place. It is, quite simply, beautiful.

The white stuff … the Artisan Resort

I am staying at the Artisan Resort, up the coast from the white sand beach of Konnos Bay and just outside the boundary of Cape Greco national park. Here, whitewashed villas line a driveway that is gated to keep out the traffic, while a tunnel of jacarandas keeps out the sun. The thick walls and double-skin roofs avoid the need for air conditioning.

Photographs on the walls of the national park's colourful wildflowers, limestone crags and bright blue waters leave me keen to get out there and explore, so owner Andreas and I lace up our hiking boots and take to the walking trail that leads from just outside our front door. First stop is the coffee caravan at the junction of the main road and the cape road. Owner Louis makes us strong Cypriot coffee – sweet and almost sludgy – for €1 apiece and we sit in the sun on plastic chairs and gaze at the building site opposite.

This will be the park's visitor centre, set to open next year after being stalled by the economic crisis. Andreas hopes that this renewed investment in the area will bring more visitors and boost the local economy. For now, there is little information available about the park, so Andreas makes the perfect companion, leading me to hidden sites not marked on my tourist map.

Down on the coast we pick our way along the sort of rudimentary, dusty path I would never have noticed alone, passing between jagged limestone ledges to a flat area of rock. Andreas tells me to take a few steps forward and I see, perfectly framed by a natural rocky window, the Palaces sea caves, a line of natural arches along the water's edge that appear much like a row of simple houses. These once sheltered Jewish refugees fleeing the Romans; today they shade kayakers as they dip in and out of coves and caves as they paddle their way along the coast.

Kayaking is a fantastic way to explore the Cape Greco coastline but hiking is even better, because we can get both down to the water's edge and up above the perilously undercut coastline at Cape Greco Tabletop. Climbing to the summit of this limestone plug is sweaty work but it has its rewards: birds including Cyprus wheatears and warblers, even a peregrine falcon on the hunt, fly almost at eye level. I am torn between looking up and looking down at the maquis shrubland at my feet, where wild garlic, anemones and poppies sway in the sea breeze. But then suddenly we are at the summit and I can see nothing but water. The intense spring sun makes me throw up my hand to shield my eyes, but from this height the tip of Europe itself is clearly visible, surrounded by brilliant ocean.

Dominating the cape – and stopping us from reaching its tip – is the British military radio installation: our eyes and ears on the Middle East. Seeing this brings home the fact that we are on the very edge of a continent, the last landfall before Syria. Its position means that Cyprus has long been a prize to be fought over, and Andreas tells me that there are ruins from every civilisation from the Phoenicians to the Greeks on the cape, the point at which would-be invaders usually landed.

Naturally, much of this is impossible to spot unless you know what you're looking for and, as Andreas leads me down a scrubby little path back towards the resort, it is abundantly clear that I do not. It all looks entirely unpromising and I find myself longing to be back in the water. That is until Andreas pulls me over a rocky ledge and into a rectangular hole in the ground – the remains of a neolithic settlement some 6,000 years old. I am gobsmacked. This row of human-cut dwellings is older than anything I have ever seen and yet it all makes sense, from the rough steps that would have acted as a front door, to the ancient road still visible in the limestone beneath our feet.

I stand in one house and look out to sea, where I see that pirate ship once again. I can see the people onboard but they cannot see me, nor the ancient city I am standing in. Ayia Napa seems very far away indeed.

1363,"How to make the most of a trip to one of Scotland's most stunning islands, plus Welsh holiday bargains and putting yourself in the picture for the D-Day landings

Take me there: Isle of Skye

Why go?

Glimmering lochs, mist-draped mountains and powder-white beaches – not to mention a road bridge to the mainland – have made Skye one of Scotland's most visited destinations. But with a little know-how (and a pair of walking boots), it's easy to escape the crowds. If it's been on your must-see list for a while, the launch of a classy new B&B, an exciting pop-up restaurant and a new flight from London City to Inverness (from 27 October, flybe.com) might persuade you this is the year to visit.

What to do

Hill walkers and monro-baggers travel from all over to tackle the peaks of the Cuillin range, the pinnacles of the Quiraing and the Old Man of Storr. But there are plenty of untrodden routes to explore: local guide Mitchell Partridge will take you off the beaten track and can also arrange fishing, wild camping, bushcraft and foraging trips (skyeghillie.co.uk). Spot whales, seals, dolphins and eagles on a thrilling boat trip with AquaXplore (aquaxplore.co.uk). Seaplane sightseeing trips launched last month (from £109 for 35 minutes, lochlomondseaplanes.com).

Where to stay

Canowindra B&B opened on the outskirts of Portree last summer offering boutique-style bedrooms and fabulous breakfasts (£145, canowindraskye.co.uk). The Black Shed is a cosy and contemporary cabin for two on a remote hillside (from £79, self-catering, canopyandstars.co.uk).

Where to eat

For Scottish cuisine with a French twist don't miss Scorrybreac, a pop-up restaurant in the family home of former Runrig lead singer Donnie Munro (01478 612939, facebook.com/ScorrybreacRestaurant). For a more traditional experience, the seven-course tasting menu at Kinloch Lodge is a treat (£80pp, kinloch-lodge.co.uk).

Insider tip

""Be sure to catch one of the regular jam sessions at the Edinbane Inn,"" says Mitchell Partridge, founder of Skye Ghillie. ""All the locals bring their instruments along and join in, and the food is great"" (edinbaneinn.co.uk).

1365,"From eco beaches with hammocks to sipping yoghurt drinks under your parasol, readers share their favourite stretches of sand along the Turkish coast

Winning tip: Kabak Bay, Ölüdeniz

It's mostly locals that you'll find here – a complete lack of watersports, plastic sun beds and boat trips gives Kabak its tranquil, hippy-esque vibe. There is a good choice of accommodation, some of which is shabby-chic. I would recommend staying in a wooden bungalow at the Olive Garden: a lovely pool, fresh food, and chickens wandering around add to the ambience.

Olympos to Çıralı

The beach that runs from the ruins at Olympos to Çıralı has everything. There are quiet fish restaurants and yoga at Çıralı, and at Olympos, backpackers and rock climbers sip beers and share communal meals at the tree houses. Above, on Mount Olympos, are the flames of the Chimaera.

This is an incredible eco-beach. Catch the local bus from Gülpinar Road in Dalyan for a breathtaking ride and then walk from the last stop through the nature reserve to the far cove. Yogis, snorkellers, dippers, a class from the local school and a vast space. You can't put sun umbrellas into the sand in June and July as the loggerhead turtle eggs are hatching just below the surface.

Mermerli beach, Antalya

This tiny beach is just a stone's throw from the bustle of Antalya's shopping, eating and drinking centre. Pay about £3.40 at the entrance to the Mermerli restaurant and descend the wooden staircase to the sandy beach. Here you will be offered sun loungers and shades and served drinks, ice-creams or freshly cooked food from the restaurant above.

Laid-back, bohemian, Butterfly valley is at the base of the Babadag mountain. We spent a day swimming, gently hiking to a waterfall and swinging in a hammock in the cool, stone tea house. We stayed put in a pre-erected tent, enjoying communal meals and drinks in the aptly named Rock Bar – and there were campfires with music, too.

Patara beach, Antalya

The stunning 11 miles of unbroken sand dunes is undeveloped save for one community-run cafe. The beach is off-limits after sunset to allow for the nocturnal life of the loggerhead sea turtles. If you are lucky, you can witness a simultaneous sunset and moonrise from the top of a dune. Absolutely magical.

Kaputas beach, Kas

This beach is well worth what is a steep descent, by a flight of steps, from the coast road. Locals and tourists use it but even during the high season you'll find that it's not crowded. It is more pebble than sand, but the swimming is great. However, what really sets it apart is the family run gözleme (pancake) establishment that is set up under an awning, where the grandmother turns out sweet and savoury snacks with alarming rapidity.

CarolFerguson

Aydıncık, Mersin

The resort has sand that is like cane sugar and the water is very warm. Flamingoes and other birds can often be seen bathing in the salt water inland, and the area nearby is a nature reserve, so pack the binoculars and cameras. The black mud from a spot just along the shoreline is also used by tourists for healing skin.

David Ormerod

Alktinkum, Çesme

At this gold-coloured sandy beach the water is incredibly clean. You can walk for a long time, and the water will still be around your hips. I would recommend Okan's Place, where you pay to enter, you get your parasol, sun-lounger, and cushion. Pleasant, not too crowded, and very peaceful. It also serves food from its own garden at the back - try the yoghurt drink with herbs.

Hotel Kum, Saros Bay

The word kum means sand in Turkish, and that is what Hotel Kum delivers. The hotel, with campsite, sits on the western shores of the Gallipoli peninsula. The beach is a stretch of perfect fine sand, gently sloping into the clear waters of Saros Bay. There is plenty of shade provided to escape the heat of an Aegean summer day, and hotel staff come round regularly to take food and drink orders.

1367,"Barricane Beach, Woolacombe, North Devon

Good for families, food and sunsets

Just on the outskirts of Woolacombe, this sandy cove, perfect for sunsets, has an island lookout and a beach cafe that serves up Sri Lankan curry (bring your own drinks). There are low ledges from which the older children jump, and sand made from crushed shells that seems as if it was washed in from the Caribbean. Grunta Beach is just beyond, or carry on around Morte Head to wild Rockham Bay, set just below North Morte Farm campsite.

• From main Woolacombe beach, head north along the Esplanade for 300m. The cove is opposite Devon Beach Court. Barricane Beach Cafe is open May–Sept, except if raining (07969 189304). Bring a rug. Three mins walk

Sandy Mouth, Bude, North Cornwall

Good for families, food and rock pools

This pretty little beach is backed by cliffs with rock pools at low tide and a very good National Trust cafe perched on the cliffs above. It's just far north enough from Bude to be a little bit hidden, but if you want something wilder, you can easily carry on a mile up the coast to gorgeous Duckpool (with its pretty meadow and stream), or the ultimately wild beach at Stanbury Mouth.

• Four miles north of Bude, turn left off A39 (direction Stibb/Coombe). Then turn left for Sandy Mouth. Five mins walk

Good for rock pools, food

This sea-level rock plateau was hewn from the cliff by quarrymen in the 18th century and is studded with fossils. More recently, the local boys' school blasted a huge rectangular rock pool in it, so you can wallow in the warmed up waters and gaze out at the blue ocean. There is a lovely walk west along the coast path to Seacombe and Winspit, and then up round to the quirky Square and Compass pub in Worth Matravers, with great pies, and a fossil museum.

• Entering Langton Matravers from Swanage direction, turn into Durnford Drove (signed Langton House) and park at the end of the road. The footpath is signed to Dancing Ledge across the fields. 20 mins walk

Atherington Beach, Littlehampton, West Sussex

Good for families and food

This quiet, rural shingle beach is a slice of tranquility along the built-up south coast. There is a sea swimming club here, a great little cafe and, if you walk east, you can find some dunes. The best way to arrive is by train to Littlehampton, then walk across the dunes to the shore.

• Between Bognor and Littlehampton (A259), signed Climping Beach, then continue past the palm-decked Black Horse Inn (01903 715175) to the beach car park.

Beautiful sand and shingle beach bordered by lagoons, heather and birdlife. The streets, churches, market place and town walls of Dunwich all vanished into the North Sea centuries ago and not much remains except this remote beach, backed by dunes and one of Britain's top nature reserves, Minsmere, with nightingale song in spring.

Good for rock pools, families

The great rock pool stands like a perfect tub, with a fantastic stretch of sand beyond and the Three Chimneys caves. This is one of the best plunge pools in Britain, scoured out of the rocks by wave-driven eddies that tumble giant cobbles in its depths. It's a slightly tricky scramble down, but it's a lot of fun to jump into the pool, with various heights to chose from.

• Llangennith is at the far north-west corner of the Gower (follow the A4118, then take first right after Oxwich). Carry on through the village, past the King's Head pub (01792 386212, kingsheadgower.co.uk), and over the mini-roundabout. Park and walk through Broughton Farm Caravan Park (01792 390000, broughtonfarmcaravanpark.co.uk) bearing left on to the coast path. After almost a mile, Bluepool Corner Bay is directly below, with the rock pool at the near end. 20 mins walk

There are some great rock pools on the way, including one large enough to jump into.

• In Embleton, take the B1399 south and turn left on the last road opposite church (direction Craster), then left after 300m to Dunstan Steads and park at the end near the beach. Continue south a mile beyond the castle to reach Craster. 10 mins walk

The pure Silver Sands of Morar, made famous by the film Local Hero, are mostly deserted. For absolute seclusion, explore a few minutes along the coast to secret Achaidh Mhoir beach. Best of all, these remote shores can be reached by train – the tiny station leads almost directly on to the pure white sands. There is also a great campsite set behind the sands called Camusdarach (01687 4502210, camusdarachcampsiteandbeach.co.uk)

• From Arisaig, follow the old coast road (B8008) past Camusdarach and turn left into the small car park. Walk down the path by the stream for 500m. Continue on right side of stream and go round the headland to find Achaidh beach. 10 mins walk

Dancing in the streets: Liverpool's Brazilica parade. Photograph: Alamy



With a passion for football and one of the largest Brazilian communities in Britain, there's no finer place to embrace World Cup fever than Liverpool. The city's hottest new venue, Camp and Furnace, a cavernous space which does duty as a nightclub, restaurant and arts centre, will be laying on a ""full-on Rio street party"" from 12 June to 13 July with DJs, sound systems, Brazilian street food and cocktails, and coverage of every game (0151 708 2890; facebook.com/CampandFurnace.Liverpool). Other highlights include an exhibition of unseen World Cup photos, a Panini sticker exchange and fanzine stalls. Entry is free and is first-come-first-served. If you can't bear for the party to end, the World Cup final on 13 July coincides with the opening weekend of Brazilica (11-19 July), Liverpool's annual Brazilian festival and carnival. It's the perfect way to bid adeus to the World Cup – at least for another four years. brazilicafestival.co.uk

ITV Fever Pitch, Manchester

The ""fan parks"" which popped up in cities across Britain for the 2010 World Cup are a bit thin on the ground this year. But Manchester is stepping up to the mark with a free festival of football at the former Granada Studios. Some 450 tonnes of sand have been shipped in for ITV's Fever Pitch to create a Brazilian-style beach soccer stadium where international teams will battle it out before the live action from Brazil is broadcast on the arena's 40sqm screen. Test your football skills in the High Tempo zone or chill out at the Little Copacabana beach bar. Entry is free. A small number of tickets will be available on the gates each day, but it's best to book ahead. itv.com/worldcup/feverpitch

Sushisamba, London

The prize for most spectacular location to watch a World Cup match (after the Maracanã stadium) must go to the 38th floor terrace of London's Heron Tower, where the hip Brazilian/Japanese restaurant Sushisamba will be hosting a month-long Mundial party. There will be cocktail and food menus inspired by the Brazil, Japan and England teams, samba dancers, Brazilian DJs, a competition to win flights to the Rio Carnival, and a handful of matches will be screened on the East Terrace (weather permitting), with all of London spread out below. sushisamba.com

Big Screen, Brighton

Brighton's beachfront cinema is back for the summer, but alongside the usual programme of blockbusters, such as ET, Dirty Dancing and Bridesmaids, it will screen highlights from the World Cup. The action kicks off on 12 June with a table-football tournament hosted by Brighton and Hove Albion, followed by a screening of the opening ceremony live from São Paulo and the first game of the tournament, Brazil v Croatia. And if England crash out, you can console yourself during the second week by watching Andy Murray defend his title at Wimbledon, which will be shown from 1pm to 5pm each day. Brighton's Big Screen is on the beach to the east of Palace Pier, next to the Brighton Wheel. Admission is free. brightonsbigscreen.com

Guanabara, London

Missed out on a ticket to Brazil? London nightclub Guanabara is promising to bring the spirit of Copacabana to Covent Garden for the duration of the World Cup. The samba club will be screening every Brazil match and most England games, accompanied by live entertainment from samba dancers, capoeira performers and football freestylers. Other games will be shown in the bar areas with headphones for a ""silent football"" experience, and there will be tasty Brazilian bar snacks, such as pães de queijo (cheese buns), bolinho de bacalhau (salt cod fishcakes), spicy fried chicken and cassava chips. Tickets are £5-£10 and £17.50 for the final, including entertainment. guanabara.co.uk/world-cup

Bavarian Beerhouse and Bristol Old Vic, Bristol

Germany may be England's sworn World Cup enemies, but we're not going to let that stop us enjoying the lively atmosphere down at Bristol's Bavarian Beerhouse. Though it only opened last summer, the beer hall already enjoys a reputation as one of the best places in the city to watch football on the big screen, accompanied by ice-cold steins of beer, oompah music and staff in lederhosen. Expect festivities to be turned up a notch during the tournament (pre-booking is essential for all England and Germany games). And if Germany do turn out to be our World Cup nemesis (again) we can always cheer ourselves up by paying a visit to the Bristol Old Vic, which from 12 June to 12 July is showing World Cup Final 1966, a play which tells the story of the team behind England's legendary victory, culminating in a re-enactment of the match onstage (tickets £5-£25). Glory days. bavarian-beerhouse.co.uk; bristololdvic.org.uk

Millennium Square, Leeds

As the host city for the Grand Départ of the Tour de France in July, Leeds could perhaps have been excused from World Cup duties this summer. So hats off to the city council for its decision to erect whopping great screens in Millennium Square for the duration of the tournament – it's one of the few in the country which is going to the trouble. Fans will be able to watch two of England's group games live (against Uruguay on 19 June and against Costa Rica on 24 June). And if England progress from the group stage, the last 16 knockout game will also be shown on either 28 or 29 June. A selection of matches with early kick-offs will also be screened. Admission is free and on a first-come first-served basis. leeds.gov.uk

Isle of Wight Festival

Following the announcement that the Glastonbury festival won't be showing some of the key World Cup games, as they clash with its headline acts, football fans attending the Isle of Wight festival (12-15 June, tickets £190) can breathe a sigh of relief: organisers have promised to show the majority of the matches on big screens in the BT Sport Field of Dreams. On 12 June, for example, festivalgoers can flit between Boy George and Brazil v Croatia, while on the Saturday night the Specials and England v Italy go head to head, which is bound to test the loyalties of the most ardent football lover. isleofwightfestival.com",Where to watch the World Cup in England,http://www.theguardian.com,[Joanne O'connor],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400670805394/Brazilica-Festival-in-Liv-004.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=dab062013dd434e2de883a8ffbda293b,2014-05-25 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/25/where-to-watch-world-cup-england
1371,"Cornwall's north coast is all about tough love: it's sea spray against granite cliffs, trees whipped into strange shapes by winds and sweeping beaches pounded by surf. Thrill-seekers love the wild landscape, and visitors flock to the fishing harbours huddled in its inlets and estuaries; celebrity chefs have also fallen for the area (Jamie Oliver at Watergate Bay, Rick Stein in Padstow). So, for holidays here, bring a surfboard and a sense of adventure.

Hip hotel

Tommy Jacks hotel, Bude

Bude has been crying out for a funky place to stay, and Tommy Jacks (doubles from £70 B&B), which opened this spring, fits the bill. Downstairs is a bar/aquarium with fish tanks and colourful, educational displays about the Cornish seascape – which makes it great for kids. The restaurant serves local seafood and has plans for a microbrewery. Rooms are simple but you'll be looking out of the window anyway, as most come with sea views.

Self-catering escape

The local artwork on display inside the 13 stylish self-catering pads at Sail Lofts (apartments from £759 a week) has impressed so many guests the owners have opened a shop to sell the photographic prints. Each of the open-plan apartments (sleeping between two and seven) comes with a parking space (gold dust in a St Ives summer) and there's a decent spa on site. Ocean offers views over Porthmeor Beach from the super-kingsize master bedroom; if an in-bath TV is top of your wish list, go for Slipway or Beach.

Lazy lunch

Hub St Ives overlooks the town's harbour. Photograph: Kirstin Prisk

Hub St Ives (lunch for two about £20), overlooking St Ives's dinky harbour, is one of those places where lunch tends to slip seamlessly into an all-afternoon craft beer-drinking session. The menu has a strong American feel but the handmade burgers are made from Launceston beef and the pulled pork is smoked on the premises. Order the Slider Tray to sample mini versions of each, along with a hotdog and a beer from the constantly changing stock. This small chain is undergoing speedy expansion, with a new site in Truro planned this summer.

Laid-back dinner

Photograph Adam Gibbard

As with all the best fish restaurants, Nathan Outlaw's latest venture, Outlaw's Fish Kitchendinner for two about £70), which opened on Port Isaac's harbourfront last summer, has a menu dictated by the catch of the day. It serves affordable small plates of seafood so that, as Nathan says: ""Anyone can enjoy as few or as many great fish dishes as they like and experience something new."" On our visit, we tried breaded witch sole with courgette chutney and Port Isaac crab on toast, bought fresh from local fisherman Callum and steamed (to retain the flavour) rather than boiled.

A night on the town

The Watering Hole claims to be the UK's only true beach bar and the location is spectacular: right on the sands at Perranporth. It was left in a precarious position by recent storms – teetering atop a sandbank, people were asked to stay away during March – but it has now reopened and is in celebratory mood: Toploader, the Hoosiers, Billy Ocean and Wheatus are all booked to play gigs on the intimate stage this summer. Sit on the terrace to drink local real ales with your toes in the sand or head inside to dance till you drop.

Activity

The ""lost church"" of Saint Piran was enveloped by Britain's tallest dunes in the 10th century but is now being dug out of the sands near Perranporth – and you can help with its excavation. Work is currently paused while more funding is secured but phase two is due to start in the autumn, to conserve the church – and open it to visitors. Until then, you can view the site – of what some say is Britain's oldest Christian building – by walking across the dunes of Gear Sands, towards the tall cross, and then turning right.

Secret beach

The wide beach at Bedruthan Steps, with its freestanding granite rocks and large car parks, is a popular spot at any time of year, but head further north along the sands towards Diggory's Island and you'll find an arc of golden beach that few people know about. At high tide you'll have to walk up and over the Park Head promontory – which makes it even less likely that you'll have to share these sands with anybody else.

Once upon a time, it was the railway and cheap rents that brought artists to St Ives; today it is the Tate St Ives (admission £7, concessions £4.50). To celebrate its 21st birthday, the seaside gallery has a three-year expansion programme, which will see its exhibition space double in size. Phase one has just opened, with an exhibition, International Exchanges: Modern Art and St Ives 1915-1965, which will run until 28 September.

1373,"Owner Peter Metcalf, who has in the past been compared with Basil Fawlty, is in prison for breaching 15 fire-safety regulations at the 90-room building

Age: Seven years under current ownership.

Appearance: Formerly, a 90-room grand estate hotel with glamorous ballroom. Currently, somewhere between Bates Motel and Fawlty Towers.

Oh, I know this one! It's that hotel in Blackpool run by that man people said was a real-life Basil Fawlty! Well done, dear! (pronounced in best Sybil-like tone).

Why's it in the news again? Was the proprietor found beating his car with a tree branch in a tragicomic excess of frustration? Did he mention the war to a group of German guests? No. He – Peter Metcalf – has been found guilty of 15 breaches of fire-safety regulations and jailed for 18 months.

Not a lot of laffs in that. The judge described him as having had ""a callous disregard for the safety of people living in this premises for which you were responsible"".

Oh, come now – it can't have been that bad. All fire exits chained or nailed shut, or blocked by broken furniture. Water to only half the building. Ceilings fallen in. Smoke alarms disabled. Homemade fuses in a cobbled-together electrical supply. Mouldy walls. Broken windows. Debris-filled bedrooms. And a single pole holding up the roof.

Oh, it was that bad. But why did guests put up with it? I mean, I know northerners are tough and Blackpool's seen better days, but still … Metcalf had turned it from a hotel into a multi-occupancy hostel, renting single rooms out by the week.

So he only had to make it slightly better than being homeless? That appears to be something he could have been thinking, yes.

Pretty crappy way to treat your fellow human beings, isn't it? Metcalf first hit the headlines when he hosted three BNP conferences in the building in 2006.

What are you saying? I'm saying that this fact – along with his previous conviction for 20 food hygiene breaches in 2008 and the revoking of his alcohol and entertainment licence in 2009 due to ""significant and longstanding fire and health and safety concerns"" – does not particularly inspire the belief that the milk of human kindness runs indefatigably through his veins.

Do say: ""Let's keep looking. There must be a nice B&B somewhere, even if it's sixpence extra for t'cruet.""

1375,"It's not rocket science, but even if it was, engineers should be able to find the answer to recruiting more women into senior positions

The engineering industry will play a vital role in the regrowth of Britain's economy but to do that we need to be able to compete on the world stage and nurture a British engineering workforce. There is a real skills shortage: by 2016, Britain will need to train 96,300 new engineers and scientists just to replace those who retire. Boosting the number of women working as engineers will play a huge part in changing this.

Increasing industry emphasis on collaborative working and communication skills, alongside core engineering know-how, means women bring a powerful mix to the table. Our industry needs to be agile and maximise its assets to make a significant and sustainable contribution to the economy, particularly in recession.

Many women leave engineering, for a wide range of reasons. Some because of the long hours culture, for others a shortage of part-time positions conflict with family responsibilities. It's not uncommon for women to feel that their opinions are not valued as highly as their male colleagues' and gaining respect and career progression within some organisations can feel like a battle.

Women leaving the profession creates a problem. The Davies and McKinsey reports both point to more diverse teams making better decisions, better financially, and in terms of mitigating risks. Acknowledging this will help to increase the number of women in leadership positions by providing role models for future talent to follow and providing a more level playing field.

The issues behind this situation are varied and complex. Unconscious bias plays a big role as we all tend to recruit in our own image. It's a natural tendency, but it's valuable to be able to notice ourselves doing it and compensate for that tendency when we need to. Courses are available to help recruiters to open their minds to the benefits of a diverse team and to embrace flexible working. In some countries parenthood is assumed to bring new skills in negotiation and management and a return from parental leave is frequently greeted with promotion.

As a female building physicist I first became conscious of the issues surrounding gender diversity when I returned to work part-time following two children. Initially this did not cause any major problems, but as I moved into a more traditionally organised company it did. I started to notice that there were very few women above me in the hierarchy and that troubled me. What happened to all the female graduates that I started with, and what did this say about my chances of a successful career?

As a result, I helped to establish WiBSE – a network for women in the building services engineering sector, to support and advise women who chose a leadership role. The solutions are out there and they're not rocket science (although as engineers we should be able to tackle them even if they were).

WiBSE is keen to support the work of the CIBSE diversity panel. The panel are taking an active role to improve diversity of all kinds across building services engineering. We are also taking action to tackle the pipeline – encouraging women to study engineering and to be a part of our future.

1377,"As the only female engineer in her team at Lotus, Jennifer Purvis explains why being a woman gives you a different perspective and the joy of driving cars on a frozen lake



Jennifer Purvis, 29, is a calibration engineer at Lotus. Having spent five years with the company, she tells us about being a female engineer in a traditional British manufacturing business.



Tell us a bit about what you do and how you got into it?

I work in the calibration department at Lotus, which controls all engine functions and warnings. Essentially we try to improve the drivability of vehicles so the cars run smoothly. I also work closely with software writers who develop the code which controls every aspect of the engine running, emission compliance and diagnostics.

At school I always did well at maths and science so engineering came naturally to me. I ended up following in my father's footsteps. He was a calibration engineer and went on to be the head of his department at Lotus. I remember being at school and my dad driving me around in development cars. Occasionally we'd have a laptop with us and he would tell me what all the numbers meant and what we were looking out for.

You're the only woman in a team of men, how do you find that?

It's certainly not difficult. I personally feel quite lucky because all of the guys I work with are incredibly lovely. Being a female does give you a different perspective though. For example, when you drive a car it's actually very important you have a different driving style. This allows you to validate all areas of the calibration and make sure there isn't a quirky little problem that hasn't been identified.

Why do you think women are so badly represented in engineering?

It's difficult to say. I've never felt held back in anyway, if anything I was encouraged to be an engineer. Poor female representation in the industry does seem to start at school though. If you looked at the numbers in my A Level classes they were very high for things like chemistry, but fell significantly for maths and even further for physics - I think maybe there were four of us in a class of 30.

At university I studied mechanical engineering and there was probably one girl to every ten to twelve guys.

What are the best parts of your job?

Probably the best part of my job is the development projects we do as part of the testing. For instance, when we do cold climate testing we go out to Sweden and try to be in an environment of minus 20 degrees or lower. We then check whether the car will start and that it can run properly in that condition. We even rent a section of an ice lake where they plough out a little track and we get to drive around on it all day testing the car.

What would you tell your younger self?

The truth is I never felt discouraged to be an engineer and I was never made to feel it was something I couldn't do. I know that sometimes other women do feel it's an industry they can't get into, but I think if there was more awareness about the different types of jobs available it would encourage more women to pursue careers in engineering.

If I was speaking to a woman who was interested in engineering, but felt being female was a barrier I would tell them that they have nothing to worry about. All of the people I have worked with have been very open-minded and no one discriminates against anyone for any reason. It's a really positive working environment.

What has been the highlight of your career so far?

A great aspect of the job is seeing a vehicle evolve from the very first concept all the way through to when the customers actually have the car, and even getting reviewed on shows like Top Gear. It's great to know you had that involvement in something that has gone on to be successful and popular.

Who inspires you?

My dad is obviously a big inspiration. I know he loves the fact I've followed in his footsteps and he certainly loves to talk about it when I go home, to the point where calibration is a banned topic at any family dinners because everyone else is fed up of hearing about it!

On a more day-to-day basis I'm inspired by the people around me who are very knowledgeable and happy to impart that knowledge down to you. Everyone has a lot of patience and it's nice to go to work as “one of the boys”.

1379,"A three-day visit to Britain by the Chinese premier Li Keqiang starting on Monday is expected to lead to nearly £18bn of deals being signed, including a deepening Chinese involvement in energy, nuclear power and other UK infrastructure.

In his first visit to Britain since becoming prime minister last year, Li will also announce investment plans that George Osborne, chancellor, will argue show that London is going to be the world centre for renminbi trading.

China Construction Bank, China's second-largest lender, has been selected to become the first clearing service for renminbi trading in London. Chinese companies are expected to announce fresh details of their plans to provide finance and technology for the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. And the recently created China Minsheng Investment (CMI) is expected to reveal plans to set up a London office and put money into British companies. CMI, led by Dong Wenbiao, chairman of China Minsheng Banking Corporation, has about £5bn under management.

Li will be accompanied by about 200 Chinese business leaders, not all of them part of the official visit, including the heads of some of his country's biggest banks. He will meet the Queen during his stay in Britain.

Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) have already agreed in principle to be minority shareholders in the Hinkley Point project.

So far only letters of intent have been signed by EDF Group, Areva, CGN and CNNC to become strategic and industrial partners in the project. The two Chinese companies were due to take a stake of between 30% and 40%, but that may yet increase.

EDF Energy, which runs 15 nuclear power plants, has been working with CGN and CNNC for 15 years. CGN currently operates 8.3 gigawatts of nuclear power. It has eight units in operation and 15 under construction, including two reactors being built in a joint venture with EDF at Taishan. CNNC has nine units in operation and 12 under construction.

Lord Prescott, former deputy prime minister and chairman of the Blair government's Chinese taskforce, predicted the Chinese government would be seeking assurances that Britain would remain in the EU, since the Chinese see Britain as a gateway to investment in the bloc.

Prescott told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: ""Both the Japanese and the Chinese take the view that investment in Britain is good only after you have the access to the European market of 450 million people."" He said the prime minister, David Cameron, ""seems to be saying now we want to get out of it – every day he says something like that. That's going to make investors say to themselves, 'Am I going to put a long-term investment in a country that is probably going to leave Europe?' ""

Prescott accused Cameron of downgrading the importance of the taskforce and said Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2012 had been a disaster.

The Home Office will also issue a report easing restrictions on visas for Chinese visitors to Britain, a longstanding Chinese demand. There is likely to be a 24-hour ""super-priority"" service for important business visitors, and the extension of a pilot scheme that lets tourists receive a British entry permit at the same time as a visa for countries in the Schengen area.

Official data shows annual goods exports to China have grown to £12.4bn last year from £7.6bn in 2010 when Cameron took office.",Chinese premier's visit to UK holds promise of £18bn of investment,http://www.theguardian.com,[Patrick Wintour],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402859989969/Li-Keqiang-011.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=4afd6d2495bbcd3a9078348a4e38abdb,2014-06-15 00:00:00,en,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/chinese-premiers-uk-visit-hold-promise-of-18bn-of-investment
1381,"Genetically modified Australian fruit could save the sight – and lives – of thousands of East African children

It's the genetically modified fruit from Australia that could turn East African nations into life-saving banana republics.



Queensland University of Technology (QUT) researchers have engineered bananas grown in far north Queensland to increase the levels of beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body.

The goal, they say, is to stop thousands of children in Uganda and the surrounding countries from going blind and dying from vitamin A deficiency.

And now they've successfully bent the banana genome, it's being tested on humans for the first time.

About 10 kilograms of the yellow fruit – with orange flesh – grown near Innisfail have just been shipped to Iowa State University, where the trials are being conducted.

Five Ugandan PhD students are working with leader Professor James Dale on the nine-year project, on which the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has spent $10m.

Dale said that by 2020 vitamin A-enriched banana varieties would be grown by farmers in Uganda, where about 70% of the population survive on the fruit.

""The highland or East African cooking banana, which is chopped and steamed, is a staple food of many East African nations, but it has low levels of micronutrients, particularly pro-vitamin A and iron,"" Dale said.

""We're aiming to increase the level of pro-vitamin A to a minimum level of 20 micrograms per gram dry weight.""

Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and is an especially severe problem in Africa, where people are poorest, according the World Health Organisation.

Many children aged from birth to six simply don't survive.

Dale said previous US trials using Mongolian gerbils had already proved successful on the bananas.

When field trials in Uganda were in place, he said, the same technology could be transferred to countries such as Rwanda, parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Tanzania.
