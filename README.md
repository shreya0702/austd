# Austd
This is a Twilio/Flask application built to estimate the probability that a news article is "fake". 
It also utilizes Bing's Spell Checker API to get number of typos and add it as a feature! The algorithm 
is a Random Forest Classifier based on the sklearn open source code!!

...A product of the Global AI Hackathon NYC 2017...

## What Austd _Really_ Is

We don't want to call news "fake" or "real". This tool is really just a way for you to check the 
_esimated reliability_ of your news article. It gives you a guess as to whether or not you can rely on it
along with a percentage of confidence. At the end of the day, you have to decide whether or not to
let your confirmation bias take you over.

## How To Use It

Go to our page! (this section will be updated once we have a link.)

Or text it! (this will be updated too.)

You will get your answer back! plus a cute gif :)
